People there have suffered from cyclones, extreme heat and prolonged periods of drought. This is turning fertile land into desert and depleting water sources, leading to food and water insecurity. Since most people in this region are subsistence farmers or pastoralists, they are significantly affected by changes in weather and climate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In order to investigate the impacts of climate change on adolescent mental health, the researchers conducted surveys and initiated group discussions. They talked to 83 adolescents aged 10 to 24 in six rural villages outside the city of Ambovombe in the Androy region. All of the participants were experiencing multidimensional poverty. Less than 14 % had electricity at home, and none of them lived in a household that owned a motorbike, car, truck or computer.</p><p>The results indicate that mental health problems are widespread among young people. A staggering 82 % of the adolescents showed probable depression. Between 76 % and 87 % exhibited probable generalised anxiety disorder. The adolescents also had high levels of climate change concern.</p><p>At the heart of this mental health crisis lies severe food insecurity. Within the previous 12 months, 90 % of the adolescents had experienced their household running out of food. 95 % reported having been hungry but not eating, and 69 % had endured an entire day without food. </p><p>How climate change leads to psychological distress</p><p>The focus group discussions with 48 adolescents revealed three main ways in which climate change translates into psychological distress for them. First, the loss of household resources leads to fear and despair. Increased heat, relentless droughts, intensified winds and suffocating sandstorms have decimated food and water supplies. The adolescents frequently used the Malagasy word 'kere', which means famine or starving to death. They reported that they had witnessed people starving. Families were forced to sell their meagre possessions to buy food and water, trapping them in a cycle of impoverishment and distress.</p><p>Second, the adolescents feel very uncertain about their future because of climate change. The fact that weather, farming and food availability have become less predictable has had a devastating impact on their psychological wellbeing. They expressed an overwhelming sense of powerlessness and helplessness. 'There's nothing that we can predict,' one adolescent lamented.</p><p>Third, the study reveals a widespread disruption of fundamental sources of resilience, such as close friends, family, religious faith, community support, school and simple opportunities for fun. Adolescents use these coping mechanisms to mitigate the effects of climate change on their lives. However, some of these sources of resilience were themselves undermined by climate change. Extreme weather prevents children from going to school, for example, while climate-induced poverty makes it impossible for adolescents to afford school fees, forcing them out of education. This economic hardship has also stripped them of possible sources of joy: Though listening to the radio or dancing to music could help them cope with their situation, the majority of adolescents do not have a radio in their household, for example. 'We don't have a radio, but we play with other kids ... we play, or we think about starvation,' one girl said.</p><p>Urgent call to action</p><p>The findings from southern Madagascar underscore a crucial distinction: unlike in many high-income countries where climate change impacts might feel more abstract, the effects on mental health are inextricably linked to the immediate reality of food and water insecurity. </p><p>In order to preserve the mental health of children and adolescents, the authors suggest several potential pathways:</p><p>Improve food and water security, as this fundamental need underpins all aspects of wellbeing.</p><p>Empower adolescents with the knowledge and skills necessary to adapt agricultural methods to a changing climate, thereby reducing their sense of powerlessness and uncertainty.</p><p>Ensure continuous, safe access to education.</p><p>Reintroduce opportunities for activities that foster psychological wellbeing, such as music, dancing </p><p>and art.</p><p>The study is relatively small, and its significance is limited. However, it highlights the extent to which children and young people are already suffering from the climate crisis. Further studies are needed to better help them and others. Consistent climate protection and effective climate adaptation are particularly important.

Serve cold, preferably with a side of exam-induced anxiety that manifests as vehement vomiting or diarrhoea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what if I told you that, after all this academic seasoning, the finished product barely qualifies as half-baked on the global scale? According to the World Bank, Bangladesh's Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) is now functionally equivalent to Grade 7 internationally. Yes, after 12 years of schooling, our students are emerging five years behind the global standard. That's not a learning gap, it's a canyon and not the grand kind.</p><p>Despite noble intentions and plenty of committees with acronyms longer than novels, our national curriculum still operates on one central principle: education is less about learning and more about surviving a system designed to test memory rather than meaning. The National Curriculum Framework 2021 promised to revolutionise education through \"competency-based learning,\" \"integrated assessments,\" and \"lifelong learning skills.\" Lovely. But much like my New Year's resolution to take up pilates, the intentions are there-just not the follow-through.</p><p>The truth is that the curriculum continues to reward regurgitation over reflection. Want proof? Open any board exam script. You'll find students rewarded for copying textbook paragraphs verbatim.</p><p>Science, meanwhile, is less about discovering the world and more about memorising definitions like a corporate compliance manual. Religion is taught as moral absolutes with minimal room for interpretation. And civic education-formally lumped into \"Bangladesh and Global Studies\"-remains stuck in the glorious past of the Liberation War, with little engagement on democratic values, constitutional rights or climate justice. The idea that a student might question why freedom of expression is only celebrated in textbooks and not tolerated in classrooms is, frankly, revolutionary-and not in a way the authorities would appreciate.</p><p>And speaking of values: where is the conversation around consent, gender equity or mental health? We have an entire generation going through puberty with the emotional intelligence of a brick because the word \"sex\" still sends policymakers into a shameful panic. There is no comprehensive sex education, no guidance on bodily autonomy, and no meaningful engagement with the reality of gender-based violence. But sure, let's spend three pages explaining types of sedimentary rocks.</p><p>If we are to believe the curriculum is designed to prepare children for the 21st century, then can someone please explain why financial literacy, digital safety, media misinformation, and climate adaptation are still missing from the syllabus?</p><p>To be fair, the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) has tried to modernise. The new curriculum for classes 1-5, launched in 2023, ditches final exams and introduces continuous assessment. It also encourages thematic learning across disciplines. But implementation has been chaotic. Teachers remain undertrained, class sizes balloon, and textbooks are riddled with errors. According to the 2022 BRAC Education Watch report, only 23 percent of primary school teachers had received in-depth training in competency-based instruction.</p><p>And let's not forget the elephant in the classroom: inequality. Students in elite urban schools get smart classrooms, extracurriculars, and debate clubs. Meanwhile, rural schools still lack toilets, let alone trained teachers for integrated learning. The English version of the national curriculum is marginally better resourced, but it still suffers from the same outdated pedagogy, just in awkwardly translated English.</p><p>The truth is, we need an education system that doesn't just manufacture employees or engineers, but nurtures citizens to become curious, compassionate, and capable of questioning the status quo without fearing that a red pen will ruin their future. This means reimagining the entire philosophy of the curriculum. Ditch rote learning entirely. Revamp textbooks to pose questions, not just provide model answers. Reward analysis over memorisation. Infuse classrooms with real-life context.</p><p>Teachers are the backbone of this transformation, and they must be treated as such. This means proper pay, professional development, and pedagogical freedom-not just strict instructions to finish the syllabus like a robot with a whistle. It also means democratising the curriculum design process. Right now, it's a top-down exercise dominated by bureaucrats, where educators, psychologists, parents, and-dare we suggest-students have minimal input. The 2024 textbook controversy, where glaring errors and politically sanitised omissions made headlines, should be a wake-up call for genuine transparency and public review.</p><p>We also need to audit the relevance of the curriculum. Why are children still learning about out-of-date agricultural production figures instead of sustainable farming practices? Why are their moral lessons framed around obedience, but not empathy or ethics in the digital age? Why is Life Skills Education an occasional workshop rather than a core subject that includes mental health, climate resilience, conflict resolution, and the basics of being a functional adult?</p><p>Until these questions are taken seriously, underneath those perfect GPAs and patriotic essays will remain a grim truth: we are handing out Grade 12 certificates for a Grade 7 education.</p><p>We can either keep producing graduates who top the charts but bottom out on creativity, confidence, and critical consciousness, or we can start treating our children like future leaders. But for that, we need a curriculum that doesn't just pass the exam but passes the test of life.</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["There is no comprehensive sex education, no guidance on bodily autonomy, and no meaningful engagement with the reality of gender-based violence.

The event, hosted at the GCA's Rotterdam Headquarters, called on governments, industries and civil society to redouble efforts to build \"resilient economies\" as the growth engine for the 21(st) century. Ambassadors and senior diplomatic representatives from 50 nations gathered in a show of support and unity for the adaptation and resilience agenda. Delegates committed to spurring sustainable growth, fostering new industries, driving innovation, and unlocking private finance to ease mounting pressures on development aid and public climate finance. The global market for climate adaptation solutions-such as advanced weather analytics, parametric insurance, and water-efficient infrastructure- is projected to be worth USD 2 trillion annually by 2026. Welcoming the attendees, Professor Patrick V. Verkooijen, President &amp; CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, lauded the diplomatic community for recognizing that adaptation is not merely a defensive measure but an essential component of global economic strategy: \"We are already in the 'Resilience Endgame'. We must prepare today for the 1.5-degree world. The devastating global impacts we see today need not define the society of tomorrow. The escape plan is to double down on adaptation and capture its incredible economic dividends.\" He added that \"the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, our flagship initiative, the largest adaptation program in the world, has shown us that growth and building resilience are intrinsically linked. But we can do so much more - together. Adaptation is about future-proofing our economies, protecting critical infrastructure, safeguarding food supplies, and ensuring that new opportunities can thrive in changing conditions. By rallying together, we multiply the impact of innovative investments and encourage the 'resilience dividend'-the powerful, compounding benefits that flow from forward-thinking action.\" Delivering remarks, Professor Jan Peter Balkenende, Former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Minister of State, and Executive Board Member of the GCA, emphasized that genuine progress on climate resilience will unlock broad-based dividends: \"What happens in the most vulnerable countries does not stay there. Climate change amplifies food insecurity, migration, and conflict. In fragile states, environmental stress can become a security threat. Europe and the world must take this seriously. Investing in resilience is not only right - it is wise.\" He added that \"This is why we need true global cooperation, based on shared interest and shared responsibility.\" Reflecting on adaptation efforts in Africa and beyond, H.E. Halima Mucheke, Ambassador of the Republic of Kenya in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, spoke about the significance of GCA's new headquarters in Nairobi: \"Kenya is proud to host the GCA's new headquarters in Nairobi which will intensify support for adaptation programs across Africa, leading these programs North-South. Around the world, resilient infrastructure is the hot new investment class. Climate adaptation is a framework for protecting infrastructure, securing food systems and creating new business and job opportunities. And it is being aided by a thriving market in climate solutions.\" He added that \"The continent's leading initiative in this area - the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme (AAAP) - has already channelled more than $15bn to strengthen essential systems against climate shocks. These funds are helping to secure the adaptability and livelihoods of nearly 60 million vulnerable people in 40 countries. We need to keep scaling this up, working as a global community, North-South, South-South, South-North-all together.\" Following the opening remarks delegates also heard from the lead architect and founder of Powerhouse Company, Nanne de Ru, about how GCA's European headquarters at the Floating Office Rotterdam is an award-winning sustainable building recognized worldwide as a model for climate-resilient infrastructure. The reception forms part of GCA's broader advocacy strategy to advance climate adaptation solutions worldwide-focusing on protecting infrastructure, securing food systems, catalysing economic growth, and fostering global collaboration.

This historic achievement is the result of decades of coordinated efforts, including the expansion of protected areas, strengthened anti-poaching enforcement, habitat restoration, and robust community engagement, particularly across the Tarai Arc Landscape (TAL).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, this success brings new and pressing challenges. Tigers now face habitat saturation and dispersal bottlenecks in addition to emerging threats from climate change, particularly in the Himalayan foothills and mid-hills regions.</p><p>Nepal's climate has been warming at an average rate of about 0.056 degrees Celsius per year since 1971, with faster warming observed in high-altitude regions, reaching up to 0.08 degrees Celsius annually in some mid-hill and trans-Himalayan areas. Over the past five decades, the country's average temperature has risen by approximately 1.6 degrees Celsius to 2.0 degrees Celsius. This warming has caused unpredictable rainfall patterns, increased flooding and droughts, and caused the degradation of wetlands and grasslands critical for supporting tiger prey. As a result, key tiger habitats in areas such as Chitwan, Bardiya and Shuklaphanta are undergoing significant changes, marked by drying wetlands, fragmented forests and the rapid spread of invasive species.</p><p>According to recent camera-trap studies, tigers are now being recorded at elevations previously considered unsuitable, such as around 2500 metres above sea level in the Dadeldhura district and 3165 metres in Ilam district. These records indicate a northward and uphill range expansion. These sightings are consistent with the global trend of wildlife shifting to higher altitudes and latitudes in response to rising temperatures.</p><p>While high-altitude movement may reflect a degree of ecological adaptation, it also indicates climate-induced stress and displacement from primary lowland habitats. A 2024 study from Nepal revealed that tigers inhabiting hilly terrains expend two to three times more energy navigating steep, rugged terrain compared to flatlands. This has significant ecological implications, increased caloric demands and greater dependency on large prey. It also raises the risk of human-wildlife conflict when natural resources are scarce. Additionally, the physical strain and elevated stress associated with such conditions can negatively impact tiger reproduction and survival rates.</p><p>A healthy prey base is fundamental to successful tiger conservation. However, several parks in Tarai are experiencing a decline in large ungulates such as sambar and swamp deer. Although smaller prey like Chital remain abundant, they do not meet the energy needs of adult tigers. Additionally, livestock encroachment in buffer zones intensifies the problem. When natural prey is insufficient, tigers may turn to livestock, increasing the risk of retaliation killings and undermining conservation improvements.</p><p>Between 2019 and 2023, Nepal reported an increase in tiger attacks on humans and livestock in and around Bardiya, Chitwan, and Banke. Key drivers include habitat encroachment and expansion of physical infrastructure, agricultural expansion, unsustainable forest resource extraction and climate-induced habitat fragmentation.</p><p>While the Tarai Arc Landscape aims to connect tiger habitats across Nepal and northern India, several challenges persist. Over 60 percent of identified dispersal corridors experience high levels of human disturbance. Infrastructure such as the East-West Highway and proposed railways obstructs natural tiger movement. Many mid-hill corridors fall within community-managed forests that lack formal protection. Tiger dispersal through these fragmented and climate-sensitive corridors is essential to maintain genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding in isolated populations.</p><p>As tigers move uphill, their habitat may begin to overlap with leopard and snow leopard territories. The consequences, not fully understood, may include increased competition for prey species, displacement of snow leopards from their traditional ranges, along with altered predator-prey dynamics and overall ecosystem balance. This growing overlap urgently requires focused research and monitoring to inform effective trans-Himalayan Conservation strategies.</p><p>Nepal's conservation strategies are robust, supported by laws and policies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act (1973) and the National Trust for Nature Conservation Act (1982), which aim to bolster government-led conservation efforts. However, climate adaptation is not fully integrated into tiger management plans, and mid-hill and highland ecosystems remain underrepresented within the protected area network. Additionally, disconnections between science and policy hinder the swift implementation of urgent ecological recommendations. The current Tiger Conservation Action Plan (2023-2032) offers a range of opportunities to address conflicts, promote coexistence, and enhance multi-landscape connectivity across Nepal and at the transboundary level.</p><p>The role of local communities, especially through buffer zone user committees, eco-clubs, green force clubs, community-based anti-poaching units and community forests, has been instrumental in reducing poaching and restoring habitats. For climate-resilient tiger conservation, we need to strengthen community-led monitoring and climate response and provide sustainable livelihoods tied to conservation. Lastly, ensuring benefit-sharing mechanisms from carbon finance, eco-tourism and payments for environmental services will also cater to tiger conservation. Climate change threatens not just tigers, but the forests and watersheds upon which communities depend. Co-management strategies must address both tiger survival and human well-being.</p><p>Nepal has made significant investments in SMART patrolling, camera trapping, genetic monitoring and other advanced conservation tools. However, to ensure sustainable tiger conservation, it is essential to implement long-term movement ecology studies using cutting-edge technologies. Priorities should include mapping climate vulnerable zones and refugia, using high-resolution data, assessing energetic stress, reproduction rates, and disease vulnerability, and strengthening research collaboration between the National Trust for Nature Conservation, academic institutions and international research partners.</p><p>Nepal must look beyond 2025 to anticipate what tiger survival will require by 2050. Tigers are ecological indicators of forest health, prey abundance and the resilience of entire ecosystems. Their survival under a changing climate tells a broader story of forest ecosystem vulnerability, water security under glacier retreat, and the challenge of human-nature coexistence in the face of rapid development.</p><p>In the future, Nepal's tigers may not be limited to Chitwan, Bardiya or other lowland protected areas. They may increasingly rely on corridors stretching toward the cloud forests of the Mahabharat range and potentially even the Himalayan foothills. If Nepal can plan a path for tiger conservation under the mounting stresses of climate change, it will serve as a global model.</p><p>Chiranjibi Prasad Pokharel is the Director of the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC).                    </p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["This growing overlap urgently requires focused research and monitoring to inform effective trans-Himalayan Conservation strategies.

Verkooijen, newly appointed Ban Ki-moon Chair on Climate Adaptation and Governance. In a thought-provoking address titled The Resilience Endgame, Professor Verkooijen delivered a stark warning on the global climate crisis, the shifting political landscape, and the urgent need for climate adaptation as a survival strategy for societies and economies worldwide. Professor Verkooijen, who also serves as President and CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and Chancellor of the University of Nairobi, described how the world has entered an era of unprecedented change-one where climate resilience is no longer an option, but a necessity. \"We may not want this new world order, but we have it-and we are getting more of it,\"  he  declared,  pointing  to  the  rapid political shifts globally that are leading   to   rollbacks   in   climate  finance,  deregulation,  and  shrinking international  cooperation.  \"The  Paris  regime  suffers a terminal illness and President  Donald  Trump  has  simply  pulled  the  plug  from  its life support system..\" The End of the 1.5-Degree Era During his address, Professor Verkooijen underscored the sobering reality that the 1.5\\xB0C threshold set by the Paris Agreement will be reached within the next two years, with global emissions at record highs. This, he warned, means that extreme weather events, food insecurity, and forced migration will intensify at a scale previously unimagined. \"We  are stuck on this overheated and overheating planet, and we cannot go back. Stuck  in a world  where each half-degree  of warming can  double the disasters. That's  the math. That's the reality,\" he stated. He also predicted that climate impacts  will  not  only  lead  to  mass  displacement  but  will  create  stark inequalities,  where wealthier  nations and  communities build resilience, while vulnerable regions face climate apartheid. Adaptation: The Only Way Forward Despite this grim prognosis, Professor Verkooijen offered a clear path forward-one grounded in adaptation and economic resilience. \"Adaptation  is not a  'nice-to-have'but a jobs  strategy, a growth strategy, an economic  winner,\"  he  asserted.  Citing  data  from  the  Global Commission on Adaptation,  he emphasized that  for every dollar  invested in adaptation, up to $10  is returned, making  it one of  the smartest economic decisions governments and businesses can make. The Netherlands, he pointed out, serves as a model of adaptation success, having transformed itself from a \"sub-Ocean\" nation into one of the most resilient economies in the world. \"If you want to see what adaptation looks like, come to the Netherlands-we turned water into land and survival into prosperity.\" A Call to Reimagine Global Governance In his closing remarks, Professor Verkooijen called for a fundamental reimagining of global governance, financial systems, and development strategies to ensure resilience is embedded in all aspects of policymaking and investment. \"Let me offer you today three key suggestions for re-imagining our world order. First, we need to re-imagine the global social contract. Second, we need to re- imagine the global finance and development system. Third, we need to re-imagine research, innovation, and higher learning.\" \"The resilience revolution is here. The only question is whether we will embrace it-or pay the price for ignoring it,\" he concluded.

The contest, launched in 2021, drew over 1,300 teams from 88 countries, aiming to accelerate scalable carbon removal technologies to combat global warming.  Mati's winning solution leverages enhanced rock weathering-a natural process accelerated by spreading finely crushed basalt on farmland. When rain interacts with atmospheric CO2, it forms a weak acid that breaks down the rock, converting CO2 into bicarbonate that is eventually carried to the ocean, where it remains stored for thousands of years. The technique also improves soil fertility and crop productivity, offering dual benefits for climate and agriculture.  \"This approach has the potential to address climate change at a planetary scale while supporting smallholder farmers, particularly in vulnerable regions like India,\" said Mati CEO Shantanu Agarwal.  Other top winners included France-based NetZero, which earned $15 million for transforming agricultural waste into biochar-a substance that sequesters carbon in soil while enhancing nutrient and water retention. Additional prizes were awarded to Vaulted Deep and Undo Carbon, whose technologies also demonstrated successful carbon sequestration at scale.  To qualify, each finalist had to remove at least 1,000 tons of CO2 in one year and present a viable plan to scale to one million tons annually.

For lighting, simple paraffin lamps are common. In some cases, families depend entirely on daylight for their activities and sleep once darkness falls.</p><p>Even households connected to the national grid face challenges. Zambia depends heavily on hydroelectric power, which accounts for around 83 % of its electricity. However, erratic rainfall in recent years has made hydropower increasingly unreliable, resulting in frequent blackouts and hampering productivity.</p><p>In response, solar energy is emerging as a viable alternative. Projects such as the Bangweulu Solar Park have improved energy access. The facility produces 54 megawatts of electricity and is supplying over 27,000 households.</p><p>Solar systems support farms, clinics and schools</p><p>Its success has attracted further investment. A $ 3.5 billion renewable energy deal with the Integrated Clean Energy Power Company (CiEG), a Chinese enterprise, aims to generate 2400 megawatts of power in the coming years.</p><p>Off-grid solutions are also expanding. Pay-as-you-go solar systems have brought electricity to many households, while mini-grids now supply power to rural schools, clinics and entire villages.

In communities with solar-powered lanterns and school mini-grids, children can study after dark, contributing to improved academic outcomes.</p><p>Cost barriers and long-term potential</p><p>Despite these advances, solar adoption still faces barriers. Basic household solar systems usually cost between ZMW 3500 and 5000 ($ 123 and $ 175) depending on the size - well beyond the reach of most rural families, whose average monthly income is under ZMW 1500 ($ 52).</p><p>The government's Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP) sets a target to raise the share of renewables in the national grid - excluding large hydroelectricity generation - to 10 % by 2026.

In 2024 and 2025, the country's major cities have been lashed by record-breaking downpours, overwhelming fragile drainage systems and displacing thousands. The latest wave of flooding in 2025 has already claimed the lives of at least 242 people, with more fatalities feared as fresh storms loom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These floods, while destructive, highlight a squandered opportunity - the inability to store excess water. Limited dam storage and poor urban watershed management result in the loss of floodwaters as runoff, rather than their storage for dry spells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate scientists have repeatedly warned about extreme weather volatility, with floods and droughts alternating as the new normal for South Asia. Without resilient water storage infrastructure and rainwater harvesting, both urban and rural areas in Pakistan will remain trapped in a cycle of water excess followed by water scarcity.A strategic and economic threat</p><p>By various measures of water availability, from the Falkenmark index - an indicator used to measure water scarcity - to the water poverty index, Pakistan currently stands as the 15th most water-stressed nation in the world.</p><p>Per the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Pakistan is predicted to slip into absolute water scarcity by 2035 - a frightening prospect for the world's fifth most populous country. According to the World Wildlife Fund-Pakistan (WWF-P), the country's annual per capita water availability has plummeted from about 5,600 cubic meters in 1947 to just 930 cubic meters in 2023 - dangerously below the level conventionally defined as water scarcity. According to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, Pakistan's water stress is among the highest globally, underscoring that securing the resource is now a matter of national survival.</p><p>Put simply: we are hurtling toward an inevitable crisis of catastrophic proportions.Water woes and climate change go hand in hand</p><p>Adding to Pakistan's water crisis is the relentless pressure of climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, although Pakistan contributes only a fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it ranks among the top 10 countries most impacted by climate change. The country has faced unprecedented heatwaves in recent years - extreme temperatures that have caused water reservoirs and dams to lose up to 20 per cent of their capacity through evaporation.</p><p>Meanwhile, global warming has accelerated the melting of glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region, which supplies over 75pc of the Indus River's flow. These trends threaten to destabilise the timing and volume of river waters that Pakistan has relied upon for millennia. Looking ahead, the World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal (CCKP) stated that Pakistan's average temperature is projected to rise by 4.9\u00b0C by 2090, foretelling even greater hydrological volatility. Erratic monsoon rains and a vicious cycle of drought followed by flood have already become the new normal.</p><p>The human and economic toll of this volatility is mounting. Rainfall patterns across the country have grown increasingly unpredictable, And when it rains, it often unleashes devastating downpours. The catastrophic floods of 2022 are a case in point: nearly one-third of the country was submerged, causing almost $30 billion in economic losses and 1,765 fatalities.</p><p>Such climate-exacerbated disasters devastate infrastructure, displace millions, and directly undermine water infrastructure by silting up dams and contaminating freshwater supplies. In essence, climate change is amplifying Pakistan's water stress, making dry seasons drier and wet seasons wetter - a recipe for sustained crisis.Indus Waters Treaty under strain</p><p>Water scarcity in Pakistan is not just a domestic issue but a regional geopolitical flashpoint. The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, a model of water sharing between Pakistan and India, is now facing a severe threat.</p><p>The treaty gave Pakistan exclusive rights to the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers (the western rivers of the Indus basin), which together provide over 80pc of Pakistan's irrigation water and around one-third of its electricity generation capacity. For decades, this arrangement maintained a fragile peace over water. However, today a combination of factors - ranging from climbing demand and geopolitical tensions to climate-induced flow variability - are testing the limits of the treaty.</p><p>A study in 2021 stated that there are signs of declining flows in the western rivers, a trend some attribute to changing weather patterns and upstream diversions. Pakistan has repeatedly raised concerns over India's construction of large upstream hydropower projects like Kishanganga and Ratle, fearing they could eventually diminish downstream flows. These concerns have even been taken to the World Bank indicating how contentious the issue has become.</p><p>Tensions spiked further in early 2025, when India announced to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam in Indian occupied Kashmir. India, without presenting evidence or conducting a thorough investigation, hastily placed blame on Pakistan - following its repeated pattern of blame and making this a poor pretext to suspend the treaty. This unprecedented declaration sent shockwaves through Pakistan.</p><p>The New York Times reported that if India were to unilaterally withhold or redirect waters, Pakistan's farming heartlands in Punjab and Sindh could face up to a 35pc reduction in water availability in critical growing seasons. Such a scenario is nothing short of a nightmare for a country whose economy and food supply are so deeply tied to these rivers.</p><p>Fortunately, immediate disruption is constrained by geography and infrastructure - during the summer monsoon, the Indus system carries huge flows that India currently lacks the capacity to fully capture or store. Nevertheless, the risk is very real in drier months: India could manipulate flows, potentially causing drought-like conditions or conversely releasing water without warning to create flash floods downstream.</p><p>Pakistan's vulnerability is compounded by its own limited storage capacity. The country can only store about 30 days' worth of water, far below the 120-day international benchmark for water security. With this limited capacity, Pakistan cannot effectively bank surplus rainwater or glacial melt for lean times. This precarious situation makes Pakistan highly exposed to any upstream disruptions and to any extreme weather event.Food security under threat</p><p>With a heavily water-dependent agricultural sector, the implications of dwindling water supplies for food production are both immediate and severe.</p><p>A study reported that approximately three-quarters of the freshwater is consumed by just four crops: wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and rice. The policies favoring these corps over the decades, have made farmers gradually shifting away from traditional, more drought-tolerant crops like millet and barley to these cash crops. This unsustainable cropping pattern is further straining groundwater and river systems. These cash crops are already experiencing the impact. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) stated in a report that in recent years, cotton production plummeted by about 41pc, largely due to flood damage and waterlogging, which in turn dealt a blow to the textile industry and rural employment.</p><p>Wheat yields have increased slightly, but its growth rate (under 2.5pc per year) lags behind the global average, partly because water shortages and erratic weather have hampered productivity. The 2022 floods alone destroyed 2.4 million hectares of cropland, wiping out food stocks and farmers' livelihoods overnight.</p><p>In light of these challenges, the SBP recorded a slowdown in agricultural growth, attributing it to climate stress and water scarcity undermining the output of key crops. With agriculture still employing a large share of Pakistan's workforce and feeding its population, such water-driven shocks propagate a broader economic crisis. The sustained water stress could ignite a vicious cycle: poor harvests, rising food prices, rural unemployment, and ultimately threats to economic and social stability.Policy gaps and the way forward</p><p>Given the gravity of the situation, one would expect a swift and robust policy response. Unfortunately, meaningful actions have been hindered by slow policy response and poor execution. The National Water Policy of 2018 and infrastructure projects like the Diamer-Bhasha dam were deemed as long-term solutions to Pakistan's water stress. While these initiatives were steps in the right direction, progress on them has been painfully slow.</p><p>The key challenges in addressing are funding issues, bureaucratic red tape, and inter-provincial mistrust over water sharing. In addition to that, politically tough but crucial measures - such as installing water meters to curb waste, regulating groundwater extraction, and incentivising crop diversification - remain largely sidelined.</p><p>Breaking out of this paralysis requires both institutional reform and international diplomacy. On the diplomatic front, Pakistan must take a proactive role in engaging India - and, where necessary, involve mediators like the World Bank or other international partners - to adapt and reinforce the Indus Waters Treaty.</p><p>Multilateral forums could help update the treaty's frameworks, incorporating climate adaptation (such as data sharing on glacial melt and monsoon forecasts) so that the spirit of equitable water sharing endures despite new pressures.</p><p>Moreover, the government urgently needs to enforce water-use regulations - for instance, by rigorously metering large consumers and clamping down on illegal wells - to prevent wasteful usage. Investing in modern irrigation techniques is equally important: moving from traditional flood irrigation to drip irrigation and other water-saving technologies can dramatically reduce agricultural water consumption.</p><p>Likewise, incentivising rainwater harvesting and watershed rehabilitation would help capture rainfall and recharge aquifers rather than letting precious water simply flow out to sea. Expanding the country's water storage capacity (through both large dams and small local reservoirs) is crucial to buffer against seasonal variability; Pakistan cannot afford to remain a country that runs on a month's worth of water.</p><p>Finally, farmers should be encouraged to diversify crops and adopt climate-smart agriculture - for example, by shifting incentives and support toward less water-intensive grains and developing varieties that can withstand droughts or floods. These adaptations in farming practices will be key to aligning the country's agricultural demands with its water reality.</p><p>Pakistan's water scarcity truly is a ticking time bomb, but it is not one without a defuse mechanism. What is needed is the political will to act before it's too late. Delaying the policy action narrows the options and multiplies the economic and environmental costs. Adopting multi-faced solutions through the combination of institutional reforms at home and effective diplomacy abroad, we can begin to secure our water future. The challenge is immense, but the cost of inaction would be far greater.</p><p>Ensuring water security is not just about avoiding droughts or floods; it is about safeguarding Pakistan's very viability as a stable and prosperous nation.</p><p>Sahar Arshad Mahmood is an assistant professor at the School of Economics and Social Sciences (SESS), IBA Karachi.

Moreover, the government urgently needs to enforce water-use regulations - for instance, by rigorously metering large consumers and clamping down on illegal wells - to prevent wasteful usage.

The  CVF,  an  international  organization  of  70 climate-vulnerable  countries representing  1.75 billion people - 20% of the  global population - accounts for just  6% of  global  emissions  yet  faces  the  most  severe impacts of climate breakdown.  By  2030, these  nations  will  require an estimated USD 500 billion annually to fund climate action, development, and nature preservation. As  CVF Secretary-General and former President of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, points  out in  the Citizenship  by Investment:  Sustainable Climate Finance for Governments   (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/climate-finance-report-\">https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/climate-finance-report-</url> 2025) report,  global climate finance remains sluggish, restrictive, and largely inaccessible  to those  who need  it most.  \"While wealthy nations delay climate action  and  funding  commitments,  frontline  countries  are  left fighting for survival.  The international  financial system  is failing  us, and we need bold solutions  to shift the balance  of power in climate  finance. Over the past two decades,  CVF countries have already lost  20% of their potential GDP growth due to  climate  impacts.  We  cannot  rely  on charity from industrialized nations. Urgent  initiatives are needed to ensure  direct and immediate access to climate finance.\" Mobilizing private capital for climate resilience Through  its globally leading international government advisory practice, Henley &amp;  Partners  has  been  providing  strategic  consulting  to  countries  on  the development,   implementation,  and  management  of  investment-based  residence (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.henleyglobal.com/residence-investment\">https://www.henleyglobal.com/residence-investment</url>)        and       citizenship (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.henleyglobal.com/citizenship-investment\">https://www.henleyglobal.com/citizenship-investment</url>)  programs.  To  date,  the firm  has facilitated over  USD 15 billion in  foreign direct investment in many states.  Its  most  recent  initiative  led  to  the  establishment of the first climate-related  citizenship investment program, the  Nauru Economic and Climate Resilience    Citizenship   Program   (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.henleyglobal.com/citizenship-\">https://www.henleyglobal.com/citizenship-</url> investment/nauru). Commenting  in the report, H.E.  Hon. David W.R.

REVIEW OF THE SECOND QUARTER 2025 NET REVENUES AND BACKLOG Revenue growth was strong in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands, supported by high demand for Energy Transition, Water, and Technology solutions. This was largely offset by a softer UK market, where revenues declined by 8% year-on-year due to the delayed outcome of the government's Spending Review. In addition, a pause in Australia's infrastructure market and a shift in our US Environment business towards a higher quality portfolio also weighed on overall growth. Total backlog was supported by significant order intake from clients in Pharmaceuticals, Data Centers, Energy Transition, US Water, and Rail, offsetting contracts winding down in US Environmental Restoration, Semiconductors and Mobility clients in UK and Australia. We are well positioned for growth in the second half of 2025, supported by the ramp?up of large contracts, increased UK spending, and improved market stability. OPERATING EBITA MARGIN Operating EBITA margin was 11.3% for the quarter, up from last year's underlying margin of 10.8% after adjusting for the EUR6.6 million Middle East provision release. Margin improvement was supported by strategic levers, including the expansion of our Key Clients program, now representing 67% of Net Revenues (up from 59% last year) and a rise in Global Excellence Centers' contribution to 15% (from 13% last year), with headcount now at 5,100 and preparations for the opening of our new center in Bucharest, Romania underway. Continued project selectivity, combined with ongoing investments in people and digital platforms, supported further efficiency gains. We remain on track with our strong margin trajectory towards the 12.5% target for 2026. REVIEW OF THE HALF YEAR 2025 PROFIT &amp; LOSS ITEMS Net revenues totaled EUR1,937 million and were stable on an organic basis year-on- year. The operating EBITA margin was strong at 11.1% (H1'24: 11.1%(1))). Non- operating costs were EUR31 million, driven by right-sizing and restructuring efforts mainly in the UK in the first quarter. Net finance expenses decreased to EUR20 million (H1'24: EUR23 million), mostly driven by on average lower interest rates on loans and borrowings. Net income from operations decreased by 4% to EUR121 million (H1'24: EUR126 million), or EUR1.35 per share (H1'24: EUR1.40). BALANCE SHEET &amp; CASH FLOW Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 68 days at the end of H1'25 (H1'24: 66 days). Net Working Capital as a percentage of annualized quarterly gross revenues was 13.4% (H1'24: 12.7%), with a strong June revenue performance driving up the receivables position. Free cash flow in the quarter was a positive EUR2 million resulting in EUR-136 million for the half year (H1'24: EUR-88 million), in line with seasonal trends and impacted by EUR26 million higher cash out versus last year as 2024 benefitted from lower cash taxes in the US, and we made prepayments for Q4 2025. Net debt increased to EUR1,039 million (H1'24: EUR1,016 million) leading to a Net Debt / Operating EBITDA ratio of 1.8x (H1'24: 1.9x), well within the strategic range of 1.5-2.5x.

Strong backlog development was supported by large framework contracts renewed at the start of the year, and underpinned by key wins in Water, Energy Transition, and Nuclear. In the UK, revenue from AMP8 Water contracts is set to gradually increase, with orders starting to be called off at the end of the second quarter. Additionally, our expanding Energy Transition backlog is expected to support near-term revenue growth. The margin benefited from disciplined project selection and effective cost management. Significant investments in talent for Energy Transition and in AI-driven Water solutions further strengthens our position to capture growth opportunities in these markets.

The acquisition of KUA in Germany further enhanced our position in the high- growth Data Center sector. Solid order intake was supported by a significant US Pharma win, driving near term growth. Furthermore, the conclusion of the UK Spending Review and substantial European government spending plans are enhancing pipeline opportunities with Key Clients in areas such as housing, defense, transport hubs and healthcare, positioning us well for the second half of the year.

However, we ended the quarter with significant rail contract wins in Netherlands, Canada and the UK. In Germany, integration of the WSP Rail acquisition is progressing well and unlocking new growth opportunities. The benefits from rightsizing initiatives in the UK and Australia, implemented in the first quarter, are expected to become more evident in the coming quarters.

This was reflected in low provisions, low impairments and loan-to-value ratios at 53% at the end of 2024. All in all, this indicates continually high credit quality. The development in total home finance lending in the Danske Bank Group across mortgage and bank home loans was stable. Housing market activity started the year at a relatively weak level, however, over the year, Realkredit Danmark experienced an increase in activity. We expect that, among other things, the decline in interest rates will have a positive effect on the housing market in 2025, with decent price increases of 4-5% broadly across Denmark. In the commercial market, we continued to have a strong market position. The loss level is low and there was an overall increase in lending in 2024. After some years with low transaction activity, where the interests of buyers and sellers have been difficult to align, we experienced renewed optimism in the market in 2024, which gives rise to expectations of a positive trend in 2025. We have strengthened our advisory services and financial solutions within home finance across bank and mortgage finance products as part of the Danske Bank Group's Forward '28 strategy, and this was well received by our customers in 2024. For both the private and the commercial segment, Realkredit Danmark and Danske Bank further strengthened the focus on contributing to the green transition. In the private segment, we expanded our collaboration with the OBH engineering consultancy firm so that customers can now also get advice about climate proofing of homes. In the commercial segment, we entered into partnerships with one of Europe's largest architecture and engineering consultancies, Sweco, and climate tech company Comundo, and our customers can now more easily get an overview of energy data and receive the right advice to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. Towards the end of 2024, we also strengthened our collaboration with Tryg, and our partnership will in future focus even more on the necessary climate adaptation. All people in Denmark currently have access to home financing and home insurance, but if we want to maintain that level of protection in Denmark, it is crucial that climate adaptation is given even greater priority.\" The report is available at rd.dk (<url normalizedValue=\"https://rd.dk/privat\">https://rd.dk/privat</url>). Highlights are shown below:   * In 2024, Realkredit Danmark's net profit was DKK?4,424 million (2023:     DKK?4,394 million). The topline increased, driven by higher interest rate     levels, although the increase was partly offset by normalised loan     impairment charges.   * Income rose significantly driven by the higher interest rate levels. Fee     income increased driven primarily by trading margins from higher refinancing     activity.   * Expenses amounted to DKK?1,010 million in 2024 (2023: DKK?1,055 million).   * Credit quality remained strong with a low level of delinquencies and robust     collateral. Loan impairment charges were at a normalised level and amounted     to DKK?333 million in 2024 (2023: an income of DKK?114 million).   * After declining lending activity in early 2024, we experienced a slight     recovery in the second half of the year. Relative to 2023, there was a     decrease in total lending. Nominal residual mortgage debt at Realkredit     Danmark fell by around DKK 12 billion to DKK?795 billion at end-2024.   * We are continuing our efforts to digitalise mortgage financing processes,     support advisory differentiation and use intelligent data-driven processes     to support a personal and proactive customer approach tailored to specific     needs and lifecycle events.   * The green transition is an important focus area for both private homes and     commercial properties. For private homes, we expanded our collaboration with     consulting engineering company OBH, so that the customers can obtain advice     on climate adaptation in addition to advice on energy improvements.   * Realkredit Danmark won the Euronext Securities award for the largest issue     of green bonds in 2024, which is a further testament to our work on helping     our customers with their green transition.   * Corporate responsibility and sustainability are key elements of Realkredit     Danmark's strategy. We want our customers and stakeholders to be confident     that in operating our business, we factor in environmental, social and     governance considerations.   * Realkredit Danmark expects net profit in 2025 to be marginally below net     profit in 2024.

Losses are likely to increase as climate change intensifies extreme weather events while rapid urban sprawl has increased asset values in high-risk areas. Protective measures such as dykes, dams and flood gates come at a price, but their financial benefits can exceed costs for rebuilding after a disaster by up to ten times, a Swiss Re Institute study shows.  Veronica Scotti, Chairperson Public Sector Solutions at Swiss Re said: \"Investments in climate adaptation, such as flood preparedness, not only promote economic stability and create jobs, but also help keep people safe. Yet there is chronic underfunding. It is therefore crucial to create the conditions for private capital to flow into climate adaptation projects and at the same time optimise the use of public funds. Quantifying the benefits of adaptation measures is a key step towards facilitating public-private investment and ultimately closing the huge financing gap.\"  To determine how effective investments in flood adaptation measures can be, it is important to quantify their financial benefits. Swiss Re Institute has carried out a study comparing economic benefits and cost ratios of selected flood adaptation measures. This value can serve as a guideline for investment decisions and help identify the best flood adaptation methods to ensure a community's economic stability, safety and resilience.  Benefit-to-cost ratio can vary significantly depending on the region. Swiss Re Institute research shows that grey infrastructure, such as dykes and levees, is highly effective in reducing coastal flood damage. Globally, their benefits can outweigh costs by two to seven times, and even up to ten times in flood-prone areas. Built to optimal standards, these structures can reduce flood damage by 60-90%, especially in densely populated regions. In less populated areas, nature-based solutions such as barrier island restoration or foreshore vegetation can be equally effective.  Similarly, policy interventions, such as land use restrictions, can enhance the value of flood prevention, particularly in emerging economies. Flood defences and, zoning restrictions are found to be almost twice as effective and feasible than accommodative measures, such as dry proofing for both coastal and river floods.  All flood interventions, especially when upgraded and maintained, can benefit both insurers and policyholders. The public and private sectors can work together in facilitating and accelerating risk adaptation: by focusing on preventing and reducing future flood losses, the public sector can shift the remaining risks to the re/insurance industry and support economic stability after disasters. By being involved in the early stages of planning protection measures, the re/insurance industry can help mitigate risks and provide financial protection.  Download report \"Resilience or rebuild?

Growth was driven by our key markets in the US and Germany, offset by a slowdown in infrastructure spending in the UK and Australia, and continued volatility in clients' short-term spending on the back of government policy uncertainties. Non-operating costs totaled EUR22 million driven by right-sizing and restructuring efforts mainly in the UK and Australia. ORDER INTAKE &amp; BACKLOG Backlog totaled EUR3.7 billion (Q1'24: EUR3.3 billion) with an organic growth of 2.8% in the quarter. Client demand for Resilience solutions remained strong, though this was slightly tempered by Places, as some clients took longer to make larger capex decisions in the current market environment. Mobility order intake reflected typical lumpiness, while visibility remains strong, supported by several significant project opportunities in the pipeline for the years ahead. Our project pipeline remains strong across all Global Business Areas (GBAs) with a focus on enhancing our position in high-growth markets. BALANCE SHEET &amp; CASH FLOW Net working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues was 12.9% (Q1'24: 11.6%) and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 67 days (Q1'24: 64 days) mainly driven by the planned ERP roll-out of the remaining part of the North American business. Free cash flow in the quarter was EUR-138 million (Q1'24: EUR-97 million), which was in line with seasonal trends and the year-on-year difference was mostly driven by the timing of some annual software payments. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS RESILIENCE   (38% of net revenues)   in EUR millions                             First Quarter   Period ended 31 March 2025            2025    2024    change ---------------------------------------------------------------   Net revenues                            368     354       4% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Organic growth(1))                     4.0%    8.2% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Order intake                            476     449       6% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog net revenues                  1,121   1,063       5% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog organic growth (%, ytd)(1))   10.0%    9.7% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog organic growth (%, yoy)(1))    8.7%   10.8% --------------------------------------------------------------- The demand for our Resilience solutions remains strong, particularly in North America, Germany and the Netherlands, with Water Optimization, Climate Adaptation, and Energy Transition serving as key growth drivers. While some large remediation projects are concluding, other significant capital programs, such as AMP8 in the UK, are starting, and we continue to focus on high-growth, high-value offerings that enhance backlog quality. In the US, the water market is experiencing increased activity, with changes in regulations and funding schemes creating additional pipeline opportunities. PLACES   (37% of net revenues)   in EUR millions                             First Quarter   Period ended 31 March 2025            2025    2024    change ---------------------------------------------------------------   Net revenues                            354     374      -6% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Organic growth (%)(1))                -2.7%   -1.1% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Order intake                            364     383      -5% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog net revenues                  1,580   1,493       6% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog organic growth (%, ytd)(1))    0.5%    0.0% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog organic growth (%, yoy)(1))    9.4%   -4.0% --------------------------------------------------------------- Places revenues were impacted by clients in the industrial manufacturing sector taking longer to finalize large capex decisions, alongside overall softness in the UK market. However, pharmaceutical clients announced significant expansions in their investment programs in the US, creating promising pipeline opportunities. Government clients continued to deliver strong results, driven by sustained demand in healthcare and education. Momentum in the data center sector remains strong. The acquisition of KUA Group in Germany, announced and completed this quarter, further strengthens our capabilities in the European data center market, solidifying our position in this high-growth sector. MOBILITY   (23% of net revenues)   in EUR millions                             First Quarter   Period ended 31 March 2025            2025    2024    change ---------------------------------------------------------------   Net revenues                            227     216       5% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Organic growth(1))                    -1.9%    8.2% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Order intake                            227     273     -17% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog net revenues                    890     637      40% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog organic growth (%, ytd)(1))    0.0%   10.3% ---------------------------------------------------------------   Backlog organic growth (%, yoy)(1))   38.7%   18.5% --------------------------------------------------------------- The Mobility market remains strong in the US, Germany and the Netherlands offset by a slowdown in infrastructure spending in the UK and Australia. The ramp up of significant contract wins secured in the second half of last year is progressing as planned. However, this has created a temporary gap as the new projects ramp up while existing projects, including major programs in the UK and Australia, are ramping down. As we realign resources and reposition parts of the business, delivery is more phased than in the past, reflecting the growing scale of our projects and contributing to a softer first quarter. Additional opportunities entered the pipeline, particularly from government investments in Germany and the US, and from the recent WSP Infrastructure Engineering acquisition. We are well positioned for future growth from our strong backlog and pipeline, underpinned by our global expertise and continued investment in talent and capabilities.

We secured substantial wins for parking management software, HotSpot, securing future revenue for the year, but not recorded in order intake yet, in accordance with our accounting policies. Integrating Intelligence solutions into other GBAs' offerings continues to act as a strong differentiator in securing large projects, and we see ample opportunity to further extend Intelligence products to Key Clients. 2024-2026 STRATEGY \"ACCELERATING A PLANET POSITIVE FUTURE\" On 16 November 2023, Arcadis presented its 2024-2026 Strategy \"Accelerating a planet positive future\" and its 2026 financial targets; these include: organic net revenue growth of mid to high single digits over the cycle, operating EBITA margin of 12.5% in 2026, Net Debt / Operating EBITDA of 1.5-2.5x with an Investment Grade credit rating and a dividend payout ratio of 30-40% of Net Income from Operations.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank estimate that over half of low-income countries are heavily indebted. Ten years ago, it was only 30 %.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These crises have created an urgent need for substantial public spending. At the same time, they have also changed the macroeconomic environment and led to higher interest rates. Developing countries have to shoulder interest costs on external borrowing that are three times higher on average than those of industrialised countries (Spiegel and Schwank 2022). This limits their access to international financial markets and raises debt service payments.</p><p>The money that developing countries use to pay their debts is lacking elsewhere - particularly for investments in sustainable development. According to the United Nations, in 2023, 54 developing countries, including 25 African countries, spent over 10 % of their state revenue on net interest payments (UNCTAD 2024). Experts estimate that in 2024, 92 countries paid more for external public debt service than for investments in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (OECD 2025).</p><p>The Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) in Seville (Spain) in June offers an opportunity to reform global debt policy. Given that a broad spectrum of interest groups will attend, there is an opportunity to discuss solutions and arrive at a common understanding of possible reforms. It would be particularly beneficial to, first, improve existing instruments and, second, establish uniform principles for a global approach to debt.</p><p>Improving existing instruments</p><p>The G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments is currently the only instrument to comprehensively restructure state debt. The G20 set up this shared framework in 2020. It lays out guidelines for restructuring and relief for heavily indebted low-income countries.</p><p>An important goal was to include all G20 countries. Previously, debt restructuring was primarily agreed upon within the Paris Club, which consisted only of western industrialised countries. Other G20 countries like India, China and Saudi Arabia were excluded. In the past 15 years, however, these countries have become important creditors to developing countries.</p><p>Despite the introduction of the G20 guidelines, so far only four debtor countries have taken part: Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana and Zambia. The main reasons for low participation are the typical challenges of debt restructuring mechanisms. These include coordination problems between creditors, a lack of transparency about the debt situation and unequal participation from various creditor groups. According to a World Bank study from 2021, close to 40 % of low-income developing countries had either never published debt data on their websites or had not updated their data in the previous two years. </p><p>Greater transparency </p><p>A key reform that ought to be made to the G20 Common Framework is increasing the transparency of debt agreements: Information about debt agreements should be better coordinated between creditors and debtors (Berensmann 2024). The zero draft outcome document of the FfD4 calls for the creation of a central international debt data registry (UN 2025). This registry could be housed in the Bank for International Settlements (Berensmann 2024). </p><p>Furthermore, incentives should be created for private creditors to take part in restructurings. These could include the implementation of anti-holdout laws, which limit the ability of creditors to disrupt negotiation processes and outcomes. Since some middle-income countries are also heavily indebted, countries with low middle incomes should receive access to the G20 Common Framework, too (Berensmann 2024).</p><p>To combat the debt and climate crisis at the same time, restructuring should be better linked to development and climate goals:</p><p>Debtor countries should be obliged to use debt relief to create fiscal leeway to reach the SDGs (or climate goals in particular).</p><p>The World Bank and IMF debt sustainability analysis should better incorporate climate risks - and the volume of a country's investments in climate adaptation.</p><p>Climate-resilient Debt Clauses should be integrated into sovereign bond contracts. This means that countries could defer debt payments if a previously defined climate shock or natural disaster occurs (Berensmann 2024). The zero draft outcome document of the FfD4 also mentions clauses that allow countries to defer debt service in times of crisis. </p><p>Uniform principles for managing debt</p><p>The FfD negotiations are an inclusive process involving many public and private actors. For that reason, the FfD4 conference in Seville offers a good opportunity to develop universal principles for sovereign lending and borrowing and to make recommendations for their implementation. The zero draft outcome document of the FfD4 suggests creating a working group for this purpose.</p><p>These principles should demonstrate, for example, how negotiations over debt restructurings can be led, how information can be exchanged and how fair treatment of creditors can be ensured. They would apply to all market participants before and during a debt crisis and should also be incorporated into other instruments, like sovereign bonds. They could help solve debt crises by improving cooperation between creditors and debtors and showing how restructurings work. The G20 Common Framework should also be connected to these universal principles.</p><p>Two main problems stand in the way of implementation: first, many sets of principles currently exist alongside each other, some of which have simply been proposed and others of which have already been implemented. They include the principles of the United Nations, the G20, the OECD and the Institute of International Finance, a global association of international financial institutions. The application of different principles to actions before and during a debt crisis creates uncertainty for both creditors and debtors, however. Thus, a unification of principles based on existing recommendations is needed.</p><p>Second, there are currently no appropriate incentives to encourage creditors and debtors to adhere to such principles. This problem could be addressed by:</p><p>publishing a list of countries that adhere to these principles,</p><p>encouraging rating agencies to consider compliance with these principles in their macroeconomic analyses,</p><p>incorporating these principles into sovereign bond contracts and</p><p>including these principles in the lending policies of the international financial institutions, like the IMF (Berensmann 2024).</p><p>As a broad-based and inclusive process, the FfD4 conference offers an excellent opportunity to discuss and initiate reforms to the global debt architecture. Against the current backdrop of geopolitical tensions, this chance should not be wasted.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Since some middle-income countries are also heavily indebted, countries with low middle incomes should receive access to the G20 Common Framework, too (Berensmann 2024).

REVIEW OF THE FOURTH QUARTER 2024 Net revenues totaled EUR959 million with an organic growth of 3%, driven by our key markets in the US and the Netherlands, while being offset by project phasing in Mobility and Intelligence, and some volatility in clients' short-term spending on the back of geopolitical developments. Good order intake in the quarter was driven by Resilience and Places, while Mobility fell slightly following a very strong third quarter with multiple large, multi-year wins. Operating EBITA margin improved to a record fourth quarter high of 12.6% (Q4'23: 11.4%) driven by an optimized portfolio and a higher Global Excellence Centers (GEC) contribution. REVIEW OF THE FULL YEAR 2024: PROFIT &amp; LOSS ITEMS AND BACKLOG Net revenues totaled EUR3.9 billion with an organic growth of 5%, reflecting good growth in Energy Transition, Climate Adaptation and Intelligent Highway solutions while being offset by the impact of increased selectivity in project pursuits. The operating EBITA margin increased to 11.5% (2023: 10.4%) driven by continued focus on sustainable project choices, a higher GEC contribution and internal efficiencies from standardization and automation efforts. Non-operating costs were EUR29 million driven by portfolio optimizations and merging of our offices. Net financing expenses were EUR53 million (2023: EUR65 million), decreasing year on year as a result of an increased net derivative asset position. Net Income increased by 52% to EUR243 million (2023: EUR160 million) leading to a record EPS of EUR2.70. Net Income from Operations (NIfO) increased by 20% to EUR270 million (2023: EUR226 million), or EUR3.00 per share (2023: EUR2.51), as a result of improved performance. Backlog Net Revenues ended at a record EUR3.7 billion resulting in an organic growth of 16%. A record order intake of EUR4.4 billion was driven by projects for clients in Mobility, Technology, Energy Transition and Climate Adaptation, and resulted in a Book-to-Bill of 1.14x for the year. Our strong backlog position and growing project pipeline are providing significant visibility on future performance.

The leveraging of existing client relationships and integration of Intelligence solutions into offerings from other GBAs continued to act as a differentiator in winning large-scale projects, such as AMP8 wins in the UK, Fraser River Tunnel in Canada and the Georgia Department of Transportation in the US. BALANCE SHEET &amp; CASH FLOW We achieved Net Working Capital as percentage of annualized quarterly gross revenues of 10.8% (2023: 9.3%). As a result, Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 61 days (2023: 56 days). Free cash flow was EUR183 million for the quarter resulting in EUR228 million for the full year (2023: EUR190 million), driven by improved performance and disciplined net working capital management. The strong cash performance resulted in further deleveraging from 1.7x Net debt / operating EBITDA in 2023 to 1.3x for 2024, below the strategic target range of 1.5 - 2.5x. Net debt decreased to EUR739 million (2023: EUR873 million) and includes a EUR51 million share buyback program for long term incentive purposes. COST SYNERGIES FROM IBI AND DPS ACQUISITION MATERIALIZED Cost synergy realization from IBI and DPS acquisitions in 2022 has materialized well in line with expectations to EUR20 million (2023 year end: EUR5 million) through the rationalization in workplaces, IT integration and technology platform improvements, as well as the rationalization of overheads, insurance and support driving operational synergies. ACQUISITION OF KUA GROUP On 12 February 2025, Arcadis entered into a definitive agreement to purchase KUA Group (KUA) for EUR70 million on a cash and debt free basis, representing ~8x KUA's 2024 EBITDA. KUA is one of Germany's leaders in complex data center design and excels in architecture, design and engineering, and planning and permitting services. These capabilities complement Arcadis' strengths in site selection due diligence, program and cost management, and sustainability advisory. KUA has successfully delivered significant growth, nearly doubling its revenue over the last 3 years. Germany, the second largest data center market in Europe, is seeing accelerated growth of AI investments.

(<url normalizedValue=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/1.0/snippet/3717/eng\">https://ml.globenewswire.com/1.0/snippet/3717/eng</url>) TOKYO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census, the world's largest collaborative effort to accelerate the discovery of marine life, today announced the discovery of 866 new marine species. This is a significant step in advancing our understanding of ocean biodiversity, with discoveries expected to grow as the programme continues. \"The ocean covers 71% of our planet, yet it is said that only around 10% of marine life has been discovered so far, leaving an estimated 1-2 million species still undocumented,\" said Executive Director Mitsuyuki Unno of The Nippon Foundation representing the founding partner of the Ocean Census. \"These latest findings demonstrate how international collaboration can advance our understanding of ocean biodiversity.\" The identification and official registration of a new species can take up to 13.5 years-meaning some species may go extinct before they are even documented. To address this, The Nippon Foundation and Nekton jointly launched the Ocean Census in April 2023 to transform species discovery, accelerating the identification of marine life to close critical knowledge gaps before it's too late. Accelerating Species Discovery The Ocean Census global alliance has conducted 10 global expeditions and hosted 8 Species Discovery Workshops, awarding 19 Species Discovery Awards to taxonomists worldwide. New species of shark, sea butterfly, mud dragon, bamboo coral, water bear, octocoral, sponge, shrimp, crab, reef fish, squat lobster, pipehorse, limpet, hooded shrimp, sea spiders and brittle stars-encompassing dozens of taxonomic groups-have been registered to the Ocean Census Biodiversity Data Platform (formerly referred to as the Cyberbiodiversity System). The beta version, developed in partnership with the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre, is now accessible to researchers and the public alike. Using divers, submersibles, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), new species have been identified from depths of 1 to 4,990 meters, with analysis conducted by collaborating scientists from the Ocean Census Science Network. Three notable discoveries include:  1. Guitar Shark - Identified at around 200m depths off Mozambique and Tanzania     by world-renowned shark expert David Ebert, also known as the 'Lost Shark     Guy' (Ocean Census Species Discovery Awardee). This is only the 38th known     guitar shark species worldwide, a group so at-risk that two-thirds of its     species are threatened.  2. Turridrupa magnifica - A marine gastropod discovered at 200-500m depths off     New Caledonia and Vanuatu by Dr. Peter Stahlschmidt (University of Landau,     Germany). Turrid gastropods possess venomous \"harpoons\" used to catch prey,     producing peptides with potential applications in pain relief and cancer     treatment. A drug used to treat chronic pain was originally developed from a     related snail family, underscoring the biotechnological promise of new ocean     life.  3. New octocoral - Found in the Maldives by Aishath Sarah Hashim &amp; Aminath     Nasath Shanaan (Maldives Marine Research Institute) and Asako K Matsumoto     (Chiba Institute of Technology; The University Museum, the University of     Tokyo). There are only 5 known species of this genus. Additionally, this is     the first record genus from the Maldives It highlights the diversity yet to     be discovered. Octocorals provide essential habitat for marine life and play     a key role in reef stability and nutrient cycling. Scientists frequently encounter species that are new to science, but a species is only officially recognised once it has been formally described and published in a scientific journal. This process can take years, meaning many remain undocumented before they can be studied. Prof. Lucy Woodall, Head of Science at Ocean Census, said \"Too many species remain in limbo for years because the process of formally describing them is too slow. We urgently need to change that and adding the Species Discovery step gives us a way to rapidly start the process. Every new species-whether a shark or a sponge-deepens our understanding of marine ecosystems and the benefits they provide for the planet.\" When the Ocean Census first launched (<url normalizedValue=\"https://oceancensus.org/race-against-time-\">https://oceancensus.org/race-against-time-</url> to-discover-ocean-life-prompts-launch-of-global-initiative/), the project envisioned a Biodiversity Centres framework. The strategy has since evolved into a decentralised network of scientists participating from over 400 institutions worldwide-a more agile framework that unites diverse skills and resources globally. \"The past two years have been transformative for the Ocean Census: we've pioneered new methods, forged key partnerships, established a global network of participating scientists, and overcome the hurdles of a truly global mission,\" said Oliver Steeds, Director of the Ocean Census. \"Our estimates suggest that discovering 100,000 new species could require at least US$1 billion. We are laying the groundwork to make large-scale species discovery a reality, but our impact will ultimately be determined by how this knowledge is used to support marine protection, climate adaptation, and biodiversity conservation.\" A Global Effort for Ocean Science Endorsed under the United Nations Ocean Decade, the Ocean Census has formed strategic partnerships with national marine research institutes, museums, universities, philanthropic organisations, and technology partners. These alliances amplify research efforts in uncharted ocean regions, filling critical gaps in our understanding of marine life. \"Schmidt Ocean Institute is proud to be a partner of the Ocean Census, whose strength lies in its vast network. By uniting governments, philanthropic supporters, and leading marine research organisations, we can accelerate the discovery of ocean life at an unprecedented scale,\" said Jyotika Virmani, Executive Director of Schmidt Ocean Institute. Building on the initial findings, the Ocean Census will provide dozens more Species Discovery Awards, undertake 10 new expeditions, and host 7 additional Species Discovery Workshops in 2025 across the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans. All further data will be added to the Ocean Census Biodiversity Data Platform.

Hereby  SFG discloses the  report pursuant to  Taxonomy Regulation in accordance with  the  requirements  specified  in  article  2 of  the  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (Disclosure Regulation). Pursuant  to article 8(1) of the Taxonomy  Regulation, SFG is obliged to publish information  on how and to what extent the activities of SFG are associated with economic  activities that qualify as  environmentally sustainable under articles 3 and   9 of  the  Taxonomy  Regulation.  An  economic  activity  is  considered environmentally sustainable if it complies with the technical screening criteria set  out in Commission Delegated  Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (Climate Regulation) or in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 (Environmental Regulation). The   Taxonomy  report  contains  key  performance  indicators  related  to  the consolidated  turnover,  capital  expenses,  and  operating  expenses of SFG, in accordance  with the methodology for  compliance with the publication obligation set  out in the Disclosure Regulation. The reportable performance indicators are the  share  of  economic  activities  that  are Taxonomy-non-eligible, Taxonomy- eligible,  and  Taxonomy-aligned  in  the  sales  revenue, capital expenses, and operating expenses. Definitions An  economic  activity  is  classified  as  Taxonomy-eligible if the activity is described  in the Climate or Environmental Regulation, regardless of whether the activity  fulfils some  or all  of the  technical screening  criteria set out in those  acts. An activity  is Taxonomy-aligned if  it complies with the technical screening  criteria  defined  in  the  Climate  or  Environment  Regulation  and functions  within the minimum  safeguards set out  in article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation. Minimum  safeguards are the procedures implemented  by the undertaking to ensure compliance  with the  OECD Guidelines  for Multinational  Enterprises and the UN Guiding  Principles on Business  and Human Rights,  including the principles and rights  set out  in the  eight core  conventions mentioned  in the International Labour  Organisation's Declaration on Fundamental  Principles and Rights at Work and in the International Bill of Human Rights. A  Taxonomy-non-eligible activity is  any activity that  is not described in the Climate or Environmental Regulation. Method of calculation and background information for key performance indicators Sales revenue The  denominator includes the sales  revenue of SFG (in  the Annual Report on p. 26) in  accordance  with  the  accounting  policies  set  out  in  Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. SFG  has analysed its  economic activities and  sales for 2023 and has concluded that  the entire sales revenue of  SFG group is related to Taxonomy-non-eligible activity.  Thus, no  sales revenue  is included  in the  numerator for Taxonomy- eligible or Taxonomy-aligned activity. Capital expenses The  denominator includes  additions to  fixed assets  during the financial year before  depreciation and any revaluations other  than changes in fair value. The following  additions are included in  the denominator, as set  out in Note 13 to the  consolidated  financial  statements  -  intangible assets (Annual Report p. 50); Note  14 -  investment  properties  (Annual  Report  p.  51); and Note 15 - property,  plant, and  equipment (Annual  Report p.  52) and right-of use assets (Annual Report p. 53). In 2023 there were no Taxonomy-aligned capital expenses. SFG has not identified any capital expenses in its economic activities for 2023 that  would be related to Taxonomy-eligible  activities. All capital expenses of SFG  for 2023 are  related to  Taxonomy-non-eligible activity.  Thus, no capital expenses are included in the numerator for Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned activity. Operating expenses The  following non-capitalised  costs have  been included  in the denominator in accordance with point 1.1.3.1 of Annex I to the Disclosure Regulation:   * research and development costs,   * building renovation measures costs,   * short-term lease costs,   * maintenance and repair costs,   * any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets     of property, plant and equipment by SFG or third party to whom activities     are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective     functioning of such assets. In  2023 SFG incurred no  operating expenses in  relation to Taxonomy-aligned or Taxonomy-eligible economic activities. All operating expenses of SFG in 2023 are related  to  Taxonomy-non-eligible  activity.  Thus,  no  operating expenses are included in the numerator for Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned activity. Assessment of compliance with the Taxonomy Regulation In  order to identify  Taxonomy-eligible economic activities,  the compliance of all  activities of all  SFG group companies  with the descriptions of activities and  NACE codes set out in the Climate and Environment Regulation were assessed. While  there is a high degree of  overlap between the descriptions of activities related  to climate change  mitigation and adaptation  objectives in the Climate Regulation,  according  to  clause  18 of  Commission Notice C/2023/305, for the purposes  of  adaptation  to  climate  change,  only  activities  carried out in accordance  with the undertaking's climate adaptation  plan can be considered as Taxonomy-eligible.  As SFG has not put in  place a climate adaptation plan, none of  SFG's activities  have been  considered Taxonomy-eligible  from the point of view of adaptation to climate change. SFG  has not  identified any  activities, costs  or portions  of revenue  in its business  that could be classified as  relating to Taxonomy-aligned or Taxonomy- eligible economic activities. Minimum safeguards In  its activities, the SFG ensures compliance with international guidelines and Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  the  OECD Guidelines for Multinational  Enterprises, International  Labour Organisation's  Declaration on Fundamental  Principles and Rights at Work and  the key ILO conventions, and the UN  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  through the implementation of the due diligence process. Explanations to report forms No changes in accounting methods have been made during the reporting period. The  report forms are  submitted in accordance  with the forms  specified in the Disclosure  Regulation. The rows and sections not relevant for SFG are marked in black,  primarily the Disclosure Regulation,  in regard to Taxonomy-eligible but not  Taxonomy-aligned activities, leaves it up to each reporting party to decide whether  to fill columns  5-17. SFG has decided  not to fill  these and they are marked  in black,  which means  non-applicable for  the purposes  of the report. Furthermore,  as SFG had  no Taxonomy-aligned revenue  or costs in 2023, columns 20 (Category  (enabling activity)) and 21 (Category (transitional activity)) and rows corresponding to those, have been excluded from the tables for the purposes of simplifying the table layout and making it more user-friendly.

The United Nations estimates that $16 billion is needed for reconstruction and climate change adaptation in Pakistan.   Exactly how much money was raised at a UN-hosted conference in Geneva was not clear by the late afternoon. The Islamic Development Bank (ISDB) alone pledged $4.2 billion.  Germany will give ?94 million ($90 million) to Pakistan.  \"This is a crisis that Pakistan cannot overcome alone,\" the State Secretary in Germany's Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Jochen Flasbarth, said in Geneva. \"We are sending a signal that will hopefully have an effect.\"   The funding from Berlin will be used to finance projects like the construction of rainwater retention basins and drainage systems.  Germany already pledged ?67 million to rebuild infrastructure and deal with the social consequences after the flooding last summer.  \"It is crucial that we support Pakistan not only in immediate reconstruction, but also in adapting better and sustainably to climate change,\" Flasbarth said.  Germany is due in May to hold government negotiations with Pakistan at which further funds would likely be made available.  In a disaster of such magnitude, the solidarity of the world community is called for, Achim Steiner, the heads the UN Development Programme (UNDP), told dpa at the conference in Switzerland.  \"The recovery of Pakistan's economy is in all our interests,\" he said, adding that failure to tackle this now could result in increased migration and potentially also extremism and radicalization.  UN Secretary General Ant\\xF3nio Guterres meanwhile criticized the decades-old international financial system, including the twin pillars of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).  \"The present system was conceived by a group of rich countries. And naturally, it basically benefits rich countries,\" he said on the sidelines of the conference.  Developing countries \"are strangled by debt and have no access to financial resources they need in order to be able to address the dramatic challenges they face,\" he said. \"We need a new debt architecture.\"  While rich countries can borrow money on the markets at interest rates of 3% or 4%, poor countries can only get funds at rates of 14% and more, the UN chief said, adding that middle-income countries like Pakistan should also be given debt relief if they were threatened with insolvency.   Pakistan experienced back-to-back heat waves and devastating floods this year, killing more than 1,700 people and affecting over 33 million. Losses to the economy are estimated at $40 billion, the World Bank estimated.  Pakistan's economy is faced with a dual crises of a current account deficit and fiscal imbalance and has been bailed out by the IMF.

Guterres' trip coincided with the publication of a new report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which suggested the region is facing a \"triple whammy\" of threats: rising sea levels, ocean warming and ocean acidification.  \"This is a crazy situation: rising seas are a crisis entirely of humanity's making, a crisis that will soon swell to an almost unimaginable scale, with no lifeboat to take us back to safety,\" Guterres said in the Tongan capital Nuku'alofa.  Sea levels have risen above the global average in the south-western Pacific - where Tonga and many other island states are located - while sea surface temperatures have climbed three times faster than the global average since 1980, the WMO report found.  Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since 1980, are more intense and are lasting longer, the report said. Higher temperatures can destabilize marine ecosystems, threatening fishing grounds and coral reefs and promoting the growth of toxic algae.  Meanwhile, increased CO2 in the world's seas is accelerating ocean acidification, which can destroy coral reefs and harm sea life.  Guterres described the findings as \"an SOS on sea level rise.\"   \"A worldwide catastrophe is putting this Pacific paradise in peril,\" he said.  \"Global average sea levels are rising at an unprecedented rate. The ocean is overflowing.\"  \"The reason is clear: greenhouse gases - overwhelmingly generated by burning fossil fuels - are cooking our planet.

Due to rural-urban migration, however, the cities are growing fast. According to the central government's most recent economic survey, agriculture contributes 24 % to gross domestic product and 37 % to employment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The World Bank has stated that the country's 'vast and diverse rural space' has received 'insufficient attention from policymakers and investors'. According to this multilateral institution, 80 % of Pakistan's poor live in rural areas. The Bank's experts also noted that the neglected rural areas are important in economic, political and cultural-heritage terms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All over the country, typical challenges in rural areas include: unpaved roads, poor and unreliable, but increasingly expensive electricity supply, the lack of water and especially safe drinking water, as well as the absence of sewerage systems.</p><p>Though most rural people depend on agriculture, many of them neither have access to markets, nor to storage facilities. Fixed-line telephony never arrived in most villages, and mobile networks remain patchy. Access to new agricultural and other technologies is poor, and the rural economy is neither documented well nor digitised. Adding to people's problems, healthcare and educational institutions tend to be inadequate in rural settings. Pakistan is struggling with governance problems at all levels - and local governments are obviously particularly weak where infrastructure is weak.</p><p>Regional disparities</p><p>Pakistan is a large country, and the quality of rural infrastructure differs from region to region. Of the four provinces, Punjab is the most populous and politically most influential. Even here, however, rural infrastructure is marked by considerable disparities. While the central areas have enough rural schools, hospitals, irrigation systems and roads, development has not kept up in southern Punjab. The northern part has no formal canal system, so farms depend on rainwater and - to a certain extent - tube wells.</p><p>Things are even worse in the districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the two western provinces. The scenario is particularly dark where violent conflicts have exacerbated the problems.</p><p>Gaps in infrastructure interact in several ways. They result in vicious circles that keep people trapped in poverty. Smallholder farmers thus have good reason to feel left behind in Pakistan. They must cope with water scarcity, but also with fast rising prices for inputs - such as fertilisers, pesticides and seed. On the other hand, the prices that their harvests fetch are quite volatile.</p><p>Farmers are typically not able to save money, so they cannot invest prudently. They thus lack options for coping with climate risks. Apart from the money, of course, they would also need competent advice, which they do not get.</p><p>Little bargaining power</p><p>The traditional marketing system puts smallholders at a disadvantage in several ways. Farming families depend on multiple layers of middlemen, but they have very little bargaining power themselves. Since they cannot store what they produce, they must sell their harvests immediately, which is when the competition is toughest and farm-gate prices drop particularly low.</p><p>Since farmers' financial position is weak, they often need loans from middlemen to procure essential inputs. Whether the credits are in cash or kind, they further erode farmers' bargaining power. Indeed, middlemen sometimes even impose management decisions on farmers, deciding what they will grow, for example. Across South Asia, it is common to bemoan the exploitative role of middlemen. Aamer Hayat Bhandara, a co-founder of a civil-society foundation called Agriculture Republic in Punjab, says that both farmers and consumers suffer. While the former sell 'at cheap rates', the latter 'buy at inflated prices', he says.</p><p>To some extent, commercial banks and micro finance institutions are making a difference. However, the interest rates tend to be quite high. The more remote a village is, moreover, the less financial services are available, both of the formal or informal kind. The national and provincial governments claim to be providing maximum credit to the agriculture sector. Nonetheless, farmers are frustrated. Bhandara of Agriculture Republic categorically says that they need 'more flexible terms and lower interest rates'. He finds collateral requirements particularly harmful.</p><p>What might help</p><p>Experts suggest that local farmers' markets could make a difference. As they hardly exist, the monopoly of middlemen persists. They are powerful, benefit from the system and oppose change.</p><p>Better storage and transport opportunities would help too. They would improve the lot of both farmers and consumers. Far too often, vegetables and fruits rot away before they can be used.</p><p>Five years ago, a report published by the Asian Development Bank pointed out that in Pakistan, 30 to 40 % of total fruit and vegetable production is lost due to mishandling of the perishable products, poor transportation as well as inadequate storage facilities and market infrastructure. It reckoned that the country could save an annual $ 1 billion if it reduced post-harvest losses by 75 %.</p><p>Warehouses with proper cooling systems are needed, and so are proper packaging and specialised vehicles. Private-sector companies which earn huge profits in the food sector should become involved, says Agriculture Republic's Bhandara. In his eyes, they should also invest in capacity building and seed development in ways that increase farm productivity.</p><p>Progress is possible. In the current scenario, however, the middlemen serve an indispensable function. Without them, smallholders in remote areas would be unable to sell their produce at all and thus be limited to subsistence farming. The middlemen are also the ones who ensure access to inputs and lend farmers money.</p><p>For this reason, the middlemen cannot easily be driven out of the system, says Abid Qaiyum Suleri of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute, an independent Islamabad-based think tank. However, he sees the need 'to institutionalise the role of middlemen'. In particular, he wants regulations to fix commission prices.</p><p>Extreme weather</p><p>The climate crisis is compounding farmers' problems. Excessive rains, devastating droughts and worsening heat are hitting grassroots communities.</p><p>In 2022, unprecedented floods made international headlines when one third of the country was submerged. A UN situation report of 2023 stated: 'Flooding destroyed critical infrastructure nationwide - with everything from hospitals to health centres, schools, water and sanitation facilities, irrigation schemes, roads, bridges and government buildings left in ruins.' Of course, such damages cause particular pain where infrastructure was inadequate in the first place.</p><p>Major disasters get a lot of attention, but harmful day-to-day impacts of the climate crisis are important too. They include crop losses, increased water stress and reduced livestock production. Volatile weather patterns, moreover, mean that planting seasons are changing. According to Pakistan's National Climate Adaptation Plan of 2023, these trends affect staple crops, which means that the nation's food security is at risk.</p><p>Climate change makes it even more important to improve rural infrastructure. Experts point out that climate-smart farming could benefit from things like GIS mapping, drones and sensor technology. Early warning systems would be good too. Unfortunately, internet connectivity tends to be poor in Pakistan's rural areas. As a result, it is not only hard to implement high-tech options. All too often, it is even impossible to make smallholders aware of possible solutions.</p><p>Experts like Bhandara are right to demand multi-stakeholder approaches to improving rural infrastructure. 'We will have to bring the government, private sector, civil society, farmers and common man to one table,' he says.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["They include crop losses, increased water stress and reduced livestock production.

Southeast Asia's growing strategic importance positions Malaysia to enhance ASEAN's global influence. By leveraging its pragmatic diplomacy and Look East policy-emphasizing strategic partnerships with China and other East Asian nations-Malaysia can drive regional integration, foster economic growth, and ensure environmental stewardship. The task is not only to address current challenges but to lay the groundwork for a visionary ASEAN future extending to 2100, characterized by resilience, dynamism, and ecological sustainability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, on economic integration and green growth. A primary focus for Malaysia will be advancing economic integration within ASEAN while embedding sustainability into economic policies. As China remains the largest trading partner in the region, Malaysia can lead initiatives that streamline trade and investment flows with an emphasis on green practices. Utilizing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) as a framework, Malaysia can advocate for environmentally friendly trade policies and support green technologies.</p><p>In the context of the evolving global economic landscape, the rise of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) presents both opportunities and challenges. BRICS countries, with their significant economic clout and growing influence, offer potential avenues for expanding green trade and investment partnerships. Malaysia can leverage these relationships to foster collaboration on sustainable development initiatives and green technologies.</p><p>Looking towards 2100, Malaysia could propose the creation of a unified ASEAN Green Economic Zone. This zone would harmonize regulations and policies to promote sustainable trade and investment. Prioritizing innovation in green technologies, renewable energy, and circular economy practices will be essential. Establishing long-term economic and environmental goals will help ASEAN maintain its global leadership in sustainable development, while engaging with BRICS can enhance the region's capacity to address global challenges and drive forward the green agenda.</p><p>Second, on infrastructure development and green connectivity. Infrastructure development will be a cornerstone of Malaysia's leadership, particularly within the context of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Emphasizing the modernization of infrastructure with a focus on sustainability-such as green ports, eco-friendly railways, and smart digital networks-will drive regional integration and equitable growth.</p><p>For the future, Malaysia can propose an ASEAN-wide Green Infrastructure Master Plan for 2100. This plan should include smart cities powered by renewable energy, integrated transportation networks that reduce carbon emissions, and robust digital infrastructure supporting a low-carbon economy. Investing in sustainable infrastructure will be crucial for ASEAN to adapt to global environmental trends and maintain its competitive edge.</p><p>Third, on maritime security and environmental preservation. Maritime security and environmental preservation will be critical during Malaysia's chairmanship. Malaysia can lead ASEAN in promoting peaceful dialogue and cooperation among member states and external partners, including China, with a focus on environmental protection.</p><p>Looking to 2100, Malaysia should propose the establishment of an ASEAN Maritime Environmental Security Alliance. This alliance would focus on joint efforts to combat marine pollution, protect marine biodiversity, and ensure sustainable maritime practices. By setting a clear trajectory for maritime environmental security, Malaysia can contribute to a stable and ecologically balanced Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Fourth, digital transformation and eco-friendly technology. Aligned with its Look East policy, Malaysia can drive ASEAN's green digital transformation by leveraging advancements in Chinese technology. Advocating for collaboration in e-commerce, fintech, and smart city development with an emphasis on environmental sustainability will be key.</p><p>Malaysia can propose the creation of a Digital ASEAN Green Community by 2100. This community could integrate digital platforms across member states, enhance cross-border e-commerce, and ensure equitable access to green technologies. Establishing a regional digital innovation hub focused on eco-friendly technology and entrepreneurship will be crucial. By positioning ASEAN as a leader in green digital innovation, Malaysia can ensure the region's continued growth and relevance in a rapidly evolving, environmentally-conscious technological landscape.</p><p>Fifth, on sustainability and environmental stewardship. Addressing climate change will be a central issue during Malaysia's chairmanship. Collaborating with China on green technology and renewable energy initiatives will be essential for promoting sustainable development across ASEAN.</p><p>Looking to 2100, Malaysia can propose a comprehensive long-term sustainability framework for ASEAN. This framework should include ambitious targets for carbon neutrality, significant investment in renewable energy sources, and strategies for climate adaptation and disaster resilience. Emphasizing sustainable urbanization, conservation of natural resources, and ecosystem restoration will help ASEAN meet its environmental goals and position the region as a global leader in sustainability.</p><p>Sixth, on youth engagement and green capacity building. Engaging youth and focusing on education will be vital components of Malaysia's agenda. ASEAN's young population is a significant asset for the region's future. Malaysia can champion initiatives to equip the next generation with skills for a green, digitally connected world.</p><p>Envisioning the future, Malaysia can propose a comprehensive ASEAN Youth Green Development Program by 2100. This program could focus on education in environmental science, green technology, and sustainable entrepreneurship. Building partnerships to ensure that the region's youth are prepared to address future environmental challenges and seize green opportunities will be crucial. Developing this capacity will help shape a new generation of leaders and innovators driving ASEAN's sustainable success.</p><p>In summary, Malaysia's chairmanship of ASEAN in 2025 offers a pivotal opportunity to enhance the bloc's economic, security, and environmental resilience. By deepening ties with China, advancing regional integration, and fostering sustainable and inclusive growth, Malaysia can position ASEAN as a forward-thinking, cohesive, and environmentally conscious global player. Proposing a visionary plan that extends to 2100 will ensure ASEAN not only navigates current challenges but thrives in an increasingly multipolar world, setting the stage for a prosperous and ecologically balanced future.                    </p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["Collaborating with China on green technology and renewable energy initiatives will be essential for promoting sustainable development across ASEAN.

Pakistan's responsibility in terms of mitigating climate change is indeed tiny, but our authorities have paid far too little attention to adaption. Poor governance, lack of planning and the lack of adaption strategies have compounded this year's disaster.</p><p>It adds to the problems that municipal authorities are weak in Pakistan and rules often remain unenforced. The floodwaters have destroyed many houses that were built illegally close to riverbeds. To a large extent, poverty makes people encroach and settle on unsuitable land.

Policymakers, however, have irresponsibly failed to prepare the nation for the impacts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rain-induced floods have devastated homes, roads and crops. Education, health and electricity infrastructure is failing in most parts of Pakistan. The country's already fragile economy is on the verge of collapse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The unexpected torrential rains started in the middle of June. They have affected over 33 million people. Hundreds lost their lives, according to Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Hundreds of thousands have lost their homes. They had to flee to relief camps and other safe places as cities, towns and villages were inundated.</p><p>Food prices have skyrocketed in view of lost harvests, so many people's food security has become precarious. In early September, about one third of the country was under water, so the next sowing season may also be affected. Experts reckon, moreover, that over 900,000 farm animals were lost.</p><p>International support</p><p>The cash-strapped Pakistani government has only limited resources. International aid agencies have geared up their efforts to save the people from starvation, extreme weather and waterborne diseases. Visiting the country, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urged the world to help as a matter of 'justice'. Pakistan estimates the cost of flood damages at $ 30 billion.</p><p>Pakistani officials and experts point out that the country is feeling the impacts of climate change, a human-made phenomenon its people have hardly contributed to. Pakistan's share of annual global greenhouse-gas emissions is not quite one percent though it accounts for almost three percent of the world population. By comparison, Germany is home to one percent of the world population, but emits two percent of climate-relevant gases.</p><p>The floods can indeed be called a 'climate catastrophe'. First, there was an unprecedented heat wave, followed by unusually strong monsoon rains. Parched earth does not allow water to percolate. Moreover, the high rate of glacier melting meant that more water than normal was running in the rivers.</p><p>In political and economic terms, Pakistan was ill prepared for this kind of disaster. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted, and the new government relies on a multi-party coalition with many internal frictions (see Marva Khan on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). In late August, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed to release $ 1.1 billion in funding for the country to help it revive its economy.</p><p>Pakistani policymakers are demanding reparations, given that the nation can be considered an innocent victim of harm brought about by others. Pakistan's responsibility in terms of mitigating climate change is indeed tiny, but our authorities have paid far too little attention to adaption. Poor governance, lack of planning and the lack of adaption strategies have compounded this year's disaster.</p><p>It adds to the problems that municipal authorities are weak in Pakistan and rules often remain unenforced. The floodwaters have destroyed many houses that were built illegally close to riverbeds. To a large extent, poverty makes people encroach and settle on unsuitable land. The mud huts that poor people rely on were washed away fast. In many places, however, brick structures, including houses, hotels and restaurants, stood in the wrong places and could not withstand the force of the floods either.</p><p>Lessons not learned</p><p>Similar damages occurred in 2010 when large parts of Pakistan were also submerged. The lessons were obviously not learned. Provincial governments and local authorities did not ensure implementation of relevant laws to stop such illegal construction activities. This time, there was even more water and it caused even more harm.</p><p>Successive national and provincial governments have failed to prepare the country. Policymakers have paid very little attention to the climate crisis. The nation urgently needs good adaptation policies and implementation must follow fast. Otherwise, future events are likely to prove even more devastating that the current floods. Our nation is not to blame for global heating, but unless we prepare better, we will not be able to cope with it.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 11, "title": "German cabinet approves law for more climate change adaptation", "published": "2023-07-13", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Germany's coalition government agreed on measures to help the country adapt to the effects of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A corresponding bill was passed by the federal cabinet on Thursday, according to government sources.</p><p>The draft is to mandate Germany's federal states to ensure systematic and comprehensive climate adaptation strategies at a state, municipality and district level.

Business Review \u00a0 Incremental improvement across key performance metrics The Company delivered a strong financial and operational performance in 2024, making progress against strategic objectives and delivering incremental improvements across numerous key performance indicators particularly in the second half of the year. Our high-quality portfolio of modern and sustainable properties remained fully occupied at the end of the year at 99.4%, reflecting the consistent efficiency of our property management operations, the mid-market positioning of our assets, and the continued strength of demand in the Irish Private Rental Sector (?PRS?) market.  Revenue, on a like-for-like basis, increased by 1.7% in the period, with organic revenue increases supplemented by ongoing initiatives to increase ancillary revenue streams. Organic annual rental increases in Ireland, which are limited to the lower of 2% or the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (?HICP), were impacted by the lower rate of prevailing HICP inflation in H2, which remained in the range of 0% and 1.5% since June 2024. Reported revenue for the year reduced by 2.9% to ?85.3 million, driven by the impact of disposing of 66 units in 2024 which were completed as part of our ongoing asset recycling plan and the disposal of c. 5% of our portfolio completed during the second half of 2023. On a like-for-like basis, Net Rental Income (?NRI?) increased by 1.7% for the year. NRI margin for 2024 was 76.8% (2023: 77.3%) with this increasing from 76.5% in H1 despite disposals completed in H2. As highlighted by this H2 margin performance, we are implementing additional income generating and cost management initiatives to improve the profitability of our assets and we continue to review which other units in the portfolio could also benefit from similar initiatives.  Building on our progress in 2023 of rolling out our Resident App (I-RES Living), we launched our new corporate and resident websites during 2024, further assisting in streamlining tenant engagement. Whilst we experienced operating cost inflation in areas such as staff costs, we have also been impacted by Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) which are focused on the contract cleaning and security industries. We have managed to offset the majority of these inflationary impacts through reduced expenditure on utilities (reduced consumption and pricing), stable OMC service charges and repairs and maintenance costs, and strong collections during the period in excess of 99%. Adjusted G&amp;A expenses include costs such as employees? salaries, director fees, professional fees for audit, legal and advisory services, depository fees, property valuation fees, insurance costs and other general and administrative expenses, and excludes non-recurring costs. In 2024 costs increased by 1.6% with the increase driven by costs associated with the launch of our new corporate and resident websites and Chair and CEO recruitment costs.  Financing costs, which include the amortisation of certain financing expenses, interest and commitment fees, reduced by 12.4% in the period to ?23.4 million from ?26.7 million. The primary driver of the decreased financing costs relates to lower debt levels, post successful completion of the asset disposal programme in 2023 alongside the ongoing asset recycling programme. The weighted average cost of interest for the period was 3.79% compared with 2023 at 3.85%. In January 2024, I-RES reduced the overall facility size of the Revolving Credit Facility (?RCF?) from ?600 million to ?500 million which has generated commitment fee savings during the year.  The Company delivered growth of 1.4% in adjusted EPRA earnings at ?28.9 million and adjusted EPRA EPS of 5.5c during 2024, driven by ancillary revenue initiatives, rigorous cost management programmes, and lower finance costs. Reported EPRA earnings of ?25.5 million and reported EPRA EPS of 4.8c reduced by 7.5% owing to the impact of non-recurring charges recorded in the period. Adjusted Earnings (excluding fair value movements) increased 8.7% from ?28.1 million to ?30.5 million.  Non-recurring costs totalled ?3.4 million in 2024. These costs related primarily to Shareholder Activism of ?1.5 million and the Strategic Review which concluded in August at a cost of ?1.1 million. In addition, in H2, the Company terminated the contract to forward purchase 44 units in Ashbrook, Clontarf as the vendor did not achieve practical completion by the Longstop Practical Completion Date.  I-RES recognises its investment properties at fair value at each reporting period, with any unrealised gain or loss on remeasurement recognised in the profit or loss account. In the period, the fair value loss recorded on investment properties was ?33.7 million, reflecting yield expansion in the wider Irish residential market in the first half of the year and was the driver for the recorded loss before tax of ?6.7 million. We are encouraged by the yield stabilisation witnessed in the market in H2 following two years of expansion. Yield movements in the period were offset by continued positive rental growth, along with cost reduction measures, which have improved the profitability of certain assets. Our Gross Yield was 7.0% at period end, well in excess of our weighted average cost of interest of 3.79%. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Yields</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"288\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the year ended</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31 December 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">% change</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Operating Performance</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue from Investment Properties (?

Business Review \u00a0 Incremental improvement across key performance metrics The Company delivered a strong financial and operational performance in 2024, making progress against strategic objectives and delivering incremental improvements across numerous key performance indicators particularly in the second half of the year. Our high-quality portfolio of modern and sustainable properties remained fully occupied at the end of the year at 99.4%, reflecting the consistent efficiency of our property management operations, the mid-market positioning of our assets, and the continued strength of demand in the Irish Private Rental Sector (?PRS?) market.  Revenue, on a like-for-like basis, increased by 1.7% in the period, with organic revenue increases supplemented by ongoing initiatives to increase ancillary revenue streams. Organic annual rental increases in Ireland, which are limited to the lower of 2% or the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (?HICP), were impacted by the lower rate of prevailing HICP inflation in H2, which remained in the range of 0% and 1.5% since June 2024. Reported revenue for the year reduced by 2.9% to ?85.3 million, driven by the impact of disposing of 66 units in 2024 which were completed as part of our ongoing asset recycling plan and the disposal of c. 5% of our portfolio completed during the second half of 2023. On a like-for-like basis, Net Rental Income (?NRI?) increased by 1.7% for the year. NRI margin for 2024 was 76.8% (2023: 77.3%) with this increasing from 76.5% in H1 despite disposals completed in H2. As highlighted by this H2 margin performance, we are implementing additional income generating and cost management initiatives to improve the profitability of our assets and we continue to review which other units in the portfolio could also benefit from similar initiatives.  Building on our progress in 2023 of rolling out our Resident App (I-RES Living), we launched our new corporate and resident websites during 2024, further assisting in streamlining tenant engagement. Whilst we experienced operating cost inflation in areas such as staff costs, we have also been impacted by Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) which are focused on the contract cleaning and security industries. We have managed to offset the majority of these inflationary impacts through reduced expenditure on utilities (reduced consumption and pricing), stable OMC service charges and repairs and maintenance costs, and strong collections during the period in excess of 99%. Adjusted G&amp;A expenses include costs such as employees? salaries, director fees, professional fees for audit, legal and advisory services, depository fees, property valuation fees, insurance costs and other general and administrative expenses, and excludes non-recurring costs. In 2024 costs increased by 1.6% with the increase driven by costs associated with the launch of our new corporate and resident websites and Chair and CEO recruitment costs.  Financing costs, which include the amortisation of certain financing expenses, interest and commitment fees, reduced by 12.4% in the period to ?23.4 million from ?26.7 million. The primary driver of the decreased financing costs relates to lower debt levels, post successful completion of the asset disposal programme in 2023 alongside the ongoing asset recycling programme. The weighted average cost of interest for the period was 3.79% compared with 2023 at 3.85%. In January 2024, I-RES reduced the overall facility size of the Revolving Credit Facility (?RCF?) from ?600 million to ?500 million which has generated commitment fee savings during the year.  The Company delivered growth of 1.4% in adjusted EPRA earnings at ?28.9 million and adjusted EPRA EPS of 5.5c during 2024, driven by ancillary revenue initiatives, rigorous cost management programmes, and lower finance costs. Reported EPRA earnings of ?25.5 million and reported EPRA EPS of 4.8c reduced by 7.5% owing to the impact of non-recurring charges recorded in the period. Adjusted Earnings (excluding fair value movements) increased 8.7% from ?28.1 million to ?30.5 million.  Non-recurring costs totalled ?3.4 million in 2024. These costs related primarily to Shareholder Activism of ?1.5 million and the Strategic Review which concluded in August at a cost of ?1.1 million. In addition, in H2, the Company terminated the contract to forward purchase 44 units in Ashbrook, Clontarf as the vendor did not achieve practical completion by the Longstop Practical Completion Date.  I-RES recognises its investment properties at fair value at each reporting period, with any unrealised gain or loss on remeasurement recognised in the profit or loss account. In the period, the fair value loss recorded on investment properties was ?33.7 million, reflecting yield expansion in the wider Irish residential market in the first half of the year and was the driver for the recorded loss before tax of ?6.7 million. We are encouraged by the yield stabilisation witnessed in the market in H2 following two years of expansion. Yield movements in the period were offset by continued positive rental growth, along with cost reduction measures, which have improved the profitability of certain assets. Our Gross Yield was 7.0% at period end, well in excess of our weighted average cost of interest of 3.79%. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Yields</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"360\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">As at</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31 December 2023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gross Yield at Fair Value</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7.0%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6.7%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EPRA Net Initial Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5.1%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.9%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Our average monthly rent increased to ?1,814 from ?1,774 at 31 December 2023 representing an increase of 2.3% reflecting continued strong organic growth and the optimisation of the portfolio, through the selective disposal of underperforming and lower quality assets. Despite this our portfolio is currently estimated to be 18% below market rent. Occupancy of 99.4% (2023: 99.4%) reflects an effective full occupancy rate which is supported by our mid-market residential sector positioning and continues to highlight the supply/demand imbalance in the market.

Structure\u00a0  Our total investment property value at 31 December 2024 was ?1,232.2 million (including assets held for sale). This represents a 3.3% reduction compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the movement in value include the impact of the disposal of 66 units (c. 2% of units in the portfolio) as part of our ongoing asset recycling programme and yield expansion primarily in H1. Offsetting these movements were continued positive rental growth and capital investments made to maintain the high-quality properties within our portfolio. We continue to reinvest in our portfolio of assets, to ensure we maintain our exceptional levels of occupancy and tenant demand, whilst future proofing our assets.  I-RES seeks to use gearing to enhance shareholder returns over the long term. I-RES takes a proactive approach to its debt strategy to ensure the Group has laddering of debt maturities and the Group?s leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio are maintained at a sustainable level.  Our capital structure remains strong, with no debt maturities before 2026 and laddering out to 2032 thereafter. Net LTV at 31 December 2024 stood at 44.4%, down from 45.4% at 30 June 2024 and broadly in line with 31 December 2023 of 44.3%. Our leverage level remains well below the 50% maximum allowed by the Irish REIT regime and the Group?s debt financial leverage ratio covenant. Our debt facilities are made up of our ?500 million RCF and the c. ?200 million (Euro Equivalent) Private Placement Notes. The remaining undrawn committed facilities are c. ?145 million.  The Private Placement Notes were issued in March 2020 and are made up of ?130 million and $75 million notes. On closing I-RES entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap resulting in an overall weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.92% inclusive of swap costs and excluding transaction costs for the full principal of the notes. The maturity of the notes is laddered over circa six, nine and eleven years, with the first repayment due in March 2027. Drawn debt facilities are predominantly hedged against interest rate volatility, with 85% of the debt fully fixed. The Group has a weighted average drawn debt maturity of 2.3 years and no debt maturities before 2026. The weighted average cost of interest is 3.79% for 2024 (31 December 2023: 3.85%). The IFRS NAV per share is 126.2c, down from 131.7c at 31 December 2023. This is primarily driven by the fair value reduction of our properties in H1 2024, although in the second half of the year yields have stabilised resulting in like for like valuations broadly in line with 30 June 2024 (IFRS NAV per share 126.4c). \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"360\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">As at</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31 December 2023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">RCF Borrowings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">355,870</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">373,020</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Euro denominated Private Placement notes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">130,000</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">130,000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">USD denominated Private Placement notes(1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">72,415</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">67,892</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted Average Cost of Interest(2)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.79%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.85%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Progress Against Strategic Review initiatives In August, the Company concluded its Strategic Review which commenced in February and explored all strategic options available to maximise value for shareholders. The Review was overseen by a Board sub-Committee, led by Chair Hugh Scott-Barrett, and including CEO Eddie Byrne and non-executive directors Denise Turner, Philip Burns and Richard Nesbitt. The Board sub-Committee was supported by international financial and real estate advisors.  The Board unanimously concluded in August 2024 that a sale of the Company or its assets would be unlikely to maximise shareholder value. Following the conclusion of the Strategic Review, the Board remains committed to regularly and carefully assessing the suitability of our strategic direction for prevailing market conditions and remains open minded to all the options analysed as part of the Review including the sale of the Company.\u00a0  The Strategic Review identified several initiatives which the Board feels will drive value maximisation for shareholders over the medium-term, and the Company has continued to work on those initiatives in the second half of the year and has made the following progress. Asset Recycling Programme In 2024, the Company has completed the disposal of 41 units in total as part of the overall disposal target of 315 units, selling 20 assets in line with book value in a bulk sale and selling a further 21 units to individual purchasers achieving sales premiums\u00a0on average of c. 25%. An investment sale of 25 units outside of the 315-unit programme was also completed in line with book values. Together this takes the total number of units disposed of to 66 in 2024 generating total gross proceeds of c. ?19 million.  The Company expects to complete the disposal of at least a further 50 units in 2025, at an average sales premium\u00a0of between 15% and 20%, generating total gross proceeds of c. ?18 million. At 31 December 2024, 13 units are in a sales process which we expect to complete in the coming months.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"496\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Asset Recycling Programme</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31 December 2024</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">315</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Completed Disposals</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(41)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Remaining</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">274</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Revenue and Cost Initiatives In the second half of the year the Company has implemented additional income generating and cost reduction initiatives across c. 6% of the portfolio and we continue to review which other units in the portfolio could also benefit from similar initiatives. The impact of these initiatives began to impact the NRI margin in H2, aiding the full year margin outturn of 76.8% which was up from 76.5% in H1 despite asset disposals completed in H2. The Company is committed to continuing its rigorous cost control measures to improve the profitability of our assets. As part of the Strategic Review, we assessed the current internalised operating model versus an outsourced model. Our analysis highlighted that the current operating model is the optimal model for I-RES. This conclusion was arrived at for a number of reasons including cost efficiencies (VAT leakage on outsourced model), operating providers? capabilities (limited number of providers who could operate such a portfolio), a reduction in key KPI?s (occupancy and collections) and strategic focus (internal resources focused on I-RES). The Company also completed\u00a0 a strategic exit from the Cork market in the second half of the year. This is an important step towards improving cost structures and margins moving forward. Focusing on the greater\u00a0Dublin\u00a0area maximises efficiencies and the future operating leverage of the Group.  Public Policy Initiatives A new Government with a significant majority was elected in January 2025 on a five-year mandate, which is positive news for the real estate sector as a long-term focus is necessary for housing policy. The Company has continued to advocate for a balanced regulatory system aimed at delivering more homes while still protecting renters and simultaneously attracting institutional capital to address the chronic undersupply of housing which currently exists in the Irish market. The Company welcomes the Irish Government?s commitment in the Programme for Government to encourage institutional investment, continue with its commitment to review rent regulations and attract private sector capital to its Secure Tenancy Affordable Rental (?STAR?) scheme.  The Board believes the current REIT structure offers shareholders advantages over non-REIT structures, including increased liquidity, tax efficiency, and access to the exceptional dynamics of the Irish PRS market. However, certain elements of the Irish REIT structure remain restrictive when compared to other European countries, and the Company will continue to maintain active engagement with policymakers and advocate for reform. \u00a0 \u00a0  Capital Allocation As outlined by the Company in the Q3 Trading Update announcement released on 22 November 2024, the Board remains committed to maximising value for shareholders and addressing the discount between the Company?s current market capitalisation and Net Asset Value.  In line with this objective, proceeds from the ongoing asset recycling programme are expected to be deployed towards: Continuing to actively manage LTV within the Board?s target range of between 40% and 45%, and subsequently;  Prioritising excess capital towards enhancing shareholder returns through an efficient return of capital to shareholders. Proceeds realised from the disposal programme enabled the Company to successfully maintain Net LTV within the target range at the end of 2024 (44.4%) while continuing to reduce higher cost debt during the period. Financing costs reduced by 12.4% during 2024 to ?23.4 million (2023: ?26.7 million).  The Company has also been pleased with initial progress on the asset disposal programme during 2024, in particular disposals of units to individual purchasers which have successfully delivered strong sales premiums compared to book values. Therefore, having satisfied the first objective of the capital allocation strategy through prudently maintaining the Company?s LTV level within the target range and retiring higher cost debt, the Board has given consideration to an appropriate means of returning excess capital to shareholders in a tax efficient manner and is pleased to announce its intention to commence a share buyback programme with a maximum aggregate consideration of up to ?5 million. The Board believes a share buyback is an appropriate method to return excess capital at this time, given the reduction in share capital would be both accretive to earnings and net asset value per share. A further announcement will be released by the Company in due course upon the formal commencement of this share buyback programme.  The Board will continue to monitor the capital allocation strategy for the Group, taking into account the prevailing market environment and the appropriate use of the Company?s funds to best deliver on the long-term objective of maximising value for shareholders. In light of the current market environment and taking account of the current steep discount between the Company?s share price and its Net Asset Value per share, the Board believes it is appropriate to continue to focus on the above value accretive allocation strategies.\u00a0\u00a0  Dividend In line with Irish REIT legislation, the Board intends to declare a dividend of 2.20 cents per share for the six months ended 31 December 2024, bringing the total dividend for 2024 to 4.08 cents per share, in line with the requirements of Irish REIT legislation and representing the company?s dividend policy of paying out 85% of property income from the property rental business. Governance In January the Board announced that Hugh Scott-Barrett had been appointed to succeed Declan Moylan as Chair with effect from 23 February 2024.\u00a0  In March the Board announced that Eddie Byrne had been appointed to succeed Margaret Sweeney as CEO with effect from 1 May 2024. Both appointments followed an extensive and rigorous selection process led by international recruitment consultants, considering both internal and external candidates. On behalf of the Board, we wish both Declan and Margaret every success for the future. As part of the Co-Operation Agreement with Vision Capital Corporation (?Vision?), the I-RES Board recommended the appointment of two Vision nominees, Richard Nesbitt and Amy Freedman at the Company?s AGM in May 2024. Richard and Amy were elected to the Board on 10 May 2024. Under the Company?s constitution the maximum permitted number of Directors on the Board is nine. To facilitate the appointment of the two Vision nominees, the Company?s executive director Brian Fagan did not seek re-election to the Board at the 2024 AGM, thus ensuring the Board continues to meet its independence requirements in line with best practice corporate governance. Mr Fagan?s position as CFO was not impacted by this change. In May 2025 Phillip Burns, having served nine years on the Board, will not seek re-election as a non-executive director at the Company?s Annual General Meeting. We are grateful to Phillip for his outstanding contributions and commitment to the Board and its Committees and the Board would like to wish him every success for the future. Board size is a matter that the Nomination Committee keeps under continuous review. The Board is of the view that a Board of nine Directors is not optimal for the size of the Company. This is a matter which the Board intend to address as current Board members retire. In this regard, when Phillip retires in May 2025, the Board does not intend to replace him on the Board. The Nomination Committee is satisfied that the resulting Board composition will provide a suitable balance of skills, independence, knowledge and experience.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Outlook Looking ahead to 2025, the Company will continue to execute strategic initiatives in order to maximise shareholder value with a focus on crystalising value through the sale of individual units at a premium to book value and initiatives which boost NRI through increasing revenues and reducing costs. We will also continue to focus on returning surplus capital to shareholders whilst protecting our balance sheet strength for as long as our share price trades at a deep discount to NAV.  A significant opportunity exists for the new Irish government to address the country?s housing crisis, by implementing a system that gives protection and certainty to renters, while also delivering a viable investment case for the development of new private rental accommodation at scale. Since the formation of the new Irish government in January 2025, we have continued to maintain active engagement with policymakers to advocate for these reforms and will update shareholders on progress in due course. Sustainability remains central to our strategy, with a commitment to achieving Net Zero carbon by 2050 and further investment in renewable energy and smart technologies. We will maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation, focusing on long-term value creation and balance sheet management, while seeking to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders through our ongoing ordinary dividend, supplemented by periodic returns of excess capital when considered appropriate. We are well-positioned to drive growth and shareholder value and approach the year ahead with confidence. \u00a0 On behalf of the Board \u00a0 Hugh Scott-Barrett\u00a0\u00a0Eddie Byrne Non-executive Chairman\u00a0Chief Executive Officer 20 February 2025 Sustainability The business continued to make progress on our Environmental, Social and Governance (?ESG?) ambitions through environmental action and social impact. This was achieved against the backdrop of a dynamic regulatory landscape and in the midst of a leadership transition with the appointment of a new CEO.  The Irish residential rental market faces increasing scrutiny, with heightened expectations for transparency, affordability and environmental responsibility. The Board Sustainability Committee has continued its work to embed ESG principles into our approach and is committed to aligning our efforts with stakeholder expectations, while ensuring the continued sustainability of our core business. Our vision ? to be Ireland?s leading provider of rental housing, recognised for quality and value, delivering sustainable growth while being a great place to work, and maximising our contribution to the community, underpins this. Collaboration with stakeholders will remain a cornerstone of our approach as we address systemic challenges together.  Our three ESG pillars of Operating Responsibly, Protecting the Environment and Building Communities will continue to shape our efforts, deliver our impact and guide our decision making in 2025. 1. Operating Responsibly  The regulatory landscape for residential property rental evolved significantly in 2024, driven by the emerging requirements of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that came into effect under Irish Law in July 2024.  Disclosure &amp; Data We continue to address current and emerging regulatory requirements including stricter energy efficiency standards and disclosure requirements. We have been actively working towards disclosing a Sustainability Statement in accordance with the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The Board, in particular through the Sustainability Committee and the Audit Committee, has played an active role in the CSRD process by inputting into the double materiality process and, on the recommendation of those two Committees, the Board has endorsed the output. We will continue the preparations for reporting throughout 2025.\u00a0  To enable us to meet the evolving reporting requirements and make more informed decisions, we have made further investment into data capture and analysis. This has included capturing accurate data for resident energy use, building footprints, waste management, water and supplier footprints. This data collection will also allow us to better capture inefficiencies in our business which, in addition to allowing us to utilise better environmental solutions, in many cases will enable us to reduce costs. This will continue to evolve in 2025. To ensure the robustness of our approach, our ESG data and approach is assured by a third party assessor.  Risk Management We have developed comprehensive frameworks to identify and mitigate ESG risks. As part of this process in 2023, we conducted a Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CREMM) assessment to review potential risks of stranded assets and to help map out our transition to net zero for each property. In 2024 our Cyber Security Steering Group (SSG), successfully completed a cyber security assessment and updated our Cyber Strategy for 2024-2026, with the goal of elevating our cyber risk management to a ?managed? level of maturity.  Responsible Sourcing We evolved our responsible sourcing programme in 2024, including issuing a supplier ESG questionnaire to 60 of our existing supplier partners. In addition, we hosted a sustainability focused supplier education forum in which 40 of our existing supplier partners participated. The survey and the education forum focused on evaluating our suppliers? level of alignment with our ESG strategy and priorities, starting the quantification of our scope 3 supply chain emissions impacts, identifying emission reduction opportunities, and driving collective action towards documented science-based targets. Recognition All of this work culminated in maintaining and improving our ESG ratings, improving from a 2 star to a 3-star rating with GRESB and a CDP score of B. We also continue to report to the EPRA and maintained our EPRA Gold accreditation for 2024. 2. Protecting the Environment While we have made significant strides, we acknowledge the challenges of transitioning to a low-carbon economy and are investing in innovative solutions to overcome them. We are fully committed to achieve Net Zero carbon by 2050 and continued to measure and report on our organisational footprint.  Carbon Emissions In 2024, our like-for-like combined scope 1 GHG Emissions (I-RES Headquarters) and Scope 2 GHG emissions (wholly managed assets) decreased by 12.7% year on year. To reduce our overall carbon footprint, we proactively installed solar panels in 6 properties, adopted smart home technologies to reduce energy consumption and we enabled car sharing in 7 properties. 100% of I-RES? wholly owned asset common areas are powered by renewable energy.  \u00a0 In March 2024, the EU revised the Energy Performance Buildings Directive (EPBD) and introduced stricter energy performance requirements (BER ratings) for residential properties. Our efforts to meet the EPBD standards included retrofitting 3 units to improve energy efficiency and BER ratings by 7 steps. This was achieved by upgrading insulation and installing energy-efficient appliances to meet or exceed these standards. These retrofits were completed as trials to allow us to identify what opportunities we have for energy efficiency upgrades across our portfolio. We will continue to assess and roll out this 7-step property improvement approach across our portfolio. 3. Building Communities Residents We can deliver significant social value in Ireland ? to our team and to our residents. As a provider of residential spaces and services, our team is deeply connected to local communities. We are fully committed to delivering on the Five Principles of our Resident Promise ? Quality, Peace of Mind, Sustainability, Service and Community and our initiatives continue to support our 5,000 plus residents. Employees  Our people are our greatest asset, and we are committed to listening to our employees so that we can continuously develop our culture and ensure I-RES is a great place to work. Our annual employee survey continues to seek employee insights to further that aim. Our Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) committee have integrated the broader thinking and insights into our training, policy development and employee engagement initiatives. In 2024 we celebrated maintaining our silver status in Diversity &amp; Inclusion from the Irish Centre for Diversity and are actively working on a plan to achieve gold. We continued our employee training programs focused on ESG principles, ensuring every team member is aware of and aligned with our ESG vision and key initiatives. Over the course of the last 12 months, we have invested substantially in our HR function including the appointment of a HR Director sitting on the Senior Leadership Team in order to ensure that we have appropriate structures in place to allow us to develop career paths for all our staff through training, learning and development, performance appraisal, reward structures and succession planning. In addition, we have made a number of changes to our employee policies in areas that enhance I-RES as a great place to work for all our employees. Looking Forward The challenges we face also bring opportunities and remind us of the importance of collaboration and resilience in creating a sustainable future.  Over 2025 and beyond, we will continue to drive accountability and transparency while promoting sustainable practices and investments working towards publication of a CSRD aligned Sustainability Statement and the delivery of our Net Zero Carbon Transition Plan. We will be continuing our focus on carbon reduction initiatives across scope 1, 2 and 3 and measuring our social value impact, and we will continue to support our colleagues in their roles and in our community initiatives, fundraising, charitable donations and resident engagements. Market Landscape Macroeconomic Landscape Remains Positive In 2024, Ireland's economy demonstrated continued strength, with Modified Domestic Demand growth projected at 3.1%. The country's economic performance was bolstered by strong export sectors, particularly technology and pharmaceuticals. Unemployment remained near record lows at approximately 4.2%, reflecting a solid labour market underpinned by ongoing job growth and continued inward investment. Inflation moderated considerably during the year, with the Consumer Price Index trending from 4.1%2 in January to 1.4%2 in December. Inflation is forecasted to remain broadly stable at around 2.0% for 20251. For 2025, the outlook remains positive, with projected GDP growth of 2.5%1, supported by a robust export sector and ongoing foreign direct investment (FDI). Nonetheless, risks such as global economic slowdowns, potential trade disruptions and domestic challenges in housing affordability could affect the pace of growth.  Irish Housing Market Remains Underpinned by Robust Trends The Irish housing market continues to be supported by several long-term tailwinds that are expected to sustain demand and price pressures over the medium-term. The supply of housing remains significantly below levels required to meet current and future demand. To address this chronic supply and demand imbalance, an annual target of 50,500 new home completions between 2025 and 2030 has been set by the Irish government. This figure is significantly ahead of the 30,330 units completed in 20242, which was a decrease of 6.7% on completions in 2023. Therefore, policymakers are highly focused on stimulating the supply of new developments.  Ireland?s population, underpinned by a strong economy and net inward migration, is expected to grow by 18% between 2024 and 2035. Additionally, the labour market remains at near full employment, with an unemployment rate of just 4.2% as of 20242, and forecast to remain low in 2025. Immigration continues to be a major driver, with net migration expected to be over 100,000 people annually by 2025, contributing to increased demand for both rental and owner-occupied homes. Furthermore, Ireland?s position as a key destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in sectors like technology and pharmaceuticals, ensures a steady influx of highly skilled workers. Strong demand dynamics are reflected in Greater Dublin Area (GDA) house prices, which have continued to experience upward pressure during 2024. The median house price in Dublin reached ?472,000 in 2024, reflecting an annual increase of 8.3% from the previous year2. Rental prices have also seen a significant rise, with the average rent in Dublin increasing by 5.2% year-on-year. The outlook for both house prices and rents in the GDA indicates continued growth, with limited new housing stock projected to keep prices elevated through 2025, compounded by ongoing challenges in affordability and housing supply.  Development and Transaction activity continues to remain below historical levels Following on from 2023, where transaction volumes in the Irish residential sector remained at historically low levels (?240 million, c. 73% below the 10-year historical average), volumes remained relatively subdued in 2024 but increased to ?466 million worth of completed deals. Contributing factors include interest rates, which, while reducing, are still above levels seen over the last decade, and the prevailing restrictive regulatory system which the Company believes has led to a very significant reduction of private capital investment into Irish PRS.  In the years 2018 to 2022, a total of ?9.5 billion was invested into the residential sector in Ireland by institutional investors, accounting for the supply of 2,000 new apartment units per year. However, following the introduction of rent caps and increases in interest rates, no new forward-looking transactions have been completed in the Irish market across 2023 and 2024, and therefore post 2025, PRS completions are expected to decline materially5. Initial indicators of this predicted vacuum of units emerged during 2024, with Dublin apartment completions declining by 24.1%2.  Significant opportunity exists for new Irish government to increase housing supply Various public and private market reports have repeatedly flagged that the Irish rental regulatory system is not viable for institutional capital in its current form and is having a significantly negative impact on supply in the private rental market. It is imperative that the new government continue with the review of the effectiveness of RPZs before the current legislation expires in December 2025 and the Company welcomes the statements made to this effect in the recently published Programme for Government. We believe there is an opportunity to develop a system that gives protection and certainty to renters, while also delivering a viable investment case for the development of new private rental accommodation at scale and we continue to actively advocate for this reform with policymakers. Business Performance Measures \u00a0 The Group, in addition to the Operational and Financial results presented above, has defined business performance indicators to measure the success of its operating and financial strategies: Average Monthly Rent (?AMR?) AMR is calculated as actual monthly residential rents, net of vacancies, as at the stated date, divided by the total number of residential units owned in the property available to rent. Through active property management strategies, the lease administration system and proactive capital investment programmes, I-RES increases rents as market conditions permit and subject to applicable laws. It has been presented as the Company believes this measure is indicative of the Group?s performance of its operations. Occupancy Occupancy rate is calculated as the total number of residential units occupied over the total number of residential units owned as at the reporting date available to rent. I-RES strives, through a focused, hands-on approach to the business, to achieve occupancies that are in line with, or higher than, market conditions in each of the locations in which it operates. Occupancy rate is used in conjunction with AMR to measure the Group?s performance of its operations.

During the period, c.14% of the portfolio units were turned over and where applicable we applied rental increases in line with regulations.

Adjusted EPRA EPS was 5.5 cents for the year ended 31 December 2024 compared to 5.4 cents for the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by strong operational performance and lower financing costs in the period. EPRA Net Asset Value In October 2019, EPRA introduced three EPRA NAV metrics to replace the then existing EPRA NAV calculation that was previously being presented. The three EPRA NAV metrics are EPRA Net Reinstatement Value (?EPRA NRV?), EPRA Net Tangible Asset (?EPRA NTA?) and EPRA Net Disposal Value (?EPRA NDV?). Each EPRA NAV metric serves a different purpose. The EPRA NRV measure is calculated to highlight the value of net assets on a long term basis. EPRA NTA assumes entities buy and sell assets, thereby crystallising certain levels of deferred tax liability. No deferred tax liability is calculated for I-RES as it is a REIT, and taxes are paid at the shareholder level on distributions. Any gains arising from the sale of a property are expected either to be reinvested for growth, debt repayment or 85% of the net proceeds are distributed to Shareholders to maintain the REIT status. Lastly, EPRA NDV provides the reader with a scenario where deferred tax, financial instruments, and certain other adjustments are calculated to the full extent of their liabilities. \u00a0 \u00a0

changes to the Irish REIT legislation introduced in October 2019, if a REIT disposes of an asset of its property rental business and does not (i) distribute the gross disposal proceeds to shareholders by way of dividend, subject to having sufficient distributable reserves; (ii) reinvest them into other assets of its property rental business (whether by acquisition or capital expenditure) within a three-year window (being one year before the sale and two years after it); or (iii) use them to repay debt specifically used to acquire, enhance or develop the property sold, then the REIT will be liable to tax at a rate of 25% on 85% of the gross disposal proceeds. For the purposes of EPRA NTA, the Company has assumed any such sales proceeds are reinvested or used to repay debt within the required three-year window. (2)\u00a0Deferred tax is assumed as per the IFRS balance sheet. To the extent that an orderly sale of the Group?s assets were undertaken over a period of several years, during which time (i) the Group remained a REIT; (ii) no new assets were acquired or sales proceeds reinvested; (iii) any developments completed were held for three years from completion; and (iv) those assets were sold at 31 December 2024 valuations, the sales proceeds would need to be distributed to shareholders by way of dividend within the required time frame or else a tax liability amounting to up to 25% of distributable reserves plus current unrealised revaluation gains could arise for the Group. (3)\u00a0This is the purchaser costs amount as provided in the valuation certificate. Purchasers? costs consist of items such as stamp duty on legal transfer and other purchase fees that may be incurred and which are deducted from the gross value in arriving at the fair value of investment for IFRS purposes. Purchasers? costs are in general estimated at 9.96% for commercial and 4.46% for residential. \u00a0 Principal risks and uncertainties \u00a0 The Directors of the Company set out below the principal risks and uncertainties that I-RES is currently exposed to and that may impact performance in the coming financial year in pursuing its current strategy. I-RES through its risk management processes proactively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages these risks. While risk can never be fully eliminated, the risk management process is designed to identify, evaluate and respond to the material existing and emerging risks that I-RES faces in delivering on its agreed strategy and in that context therefore can only provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance that risks will not materialise. The process aims to understand and appropriately manage and mitigate identified risks. The principal risks and uncertainties, along with their strategic impact on the business and mitigating factors, have been outlined below. I-RES has also provided its belief on how the risk has changed or trended during the year ended 31 December 2024.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_14\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Geopolitical Instability, Economy and Inflation     Continuing heightened levels of global instability in economic and geopolitical arenas could lead to a general weakening of the Irish economy and increasing inflation.     The outcome of the US election is expected to bring substantial changes to US domestic and foreign policies, potentially leading to increased tensions with China and Russia and impacting global trade relations. For Ireland, this could mean changes in US trade policies, including potential tariffs and protectionist measures, which could affect Ireland's exports to the US, one of its largest trading partners. Additionally, changes in US corporate tax policies might influence the operations of US multinationals based here. Given that Ireland has both a significant financial services sector and a high level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by US firms, changes could result in fluctuations in investment flows and market stability.    Any prolonged instability in the Middle East can lead to higher energy prices, which can increase production costs for Irish businesses and reduce consumer spending power.    These, and other geopolitical developments, such as the continuing conflict in Ukraine, contribute to a broader sense of general economic uncertainty. Overall, while Ireland's economy is resilient, its openness makes it vulnerable to global economic and political shifts.     Of key concern are potential negative impacts on the Irish economy generally and particularly on the residential property sector for the greater Dublin area where our portfolio is located.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Strategic Impact</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">High    Reduced economic activity could have a negative impact on business performance, asset values and net rental income, which could affect cash flows going forward. In addition, inflationary increases in respect of input cost and payroll in excess of rent inflation would put downward pressure on Net Rental Income (NRI) and earnings.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mitigation Strategy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">On an ongoing basis, Management actively monitor and report to the Board on business performance, the macro-economic and geopolitical environment, and residential sector developments. The Board regularly considers the wider economic and macro-outlook, and its impact on I-RES? strategy and budgetary processes. We continue to monitor the impact that changes in inflation and interest rates are having on our sector. I-RES? business is focused on the greater Dublin area, which continues to be economically resilient. I-RES? properties continue to experience exceptional demand when units are available with occupancy of 99.4% as at 31 December 2024 (99.4% at 31 December 2023). There is also strong continuing focus through our internal teams on active revenue and cost control within the day-to-day business operations. I-RES retains its strong financial position, with a robust balance sheet and ample liquidity. The business has entered into interest rate hedging arrangements in relation to its Revolving Credit Facility (?RCF?) which has resulted in 85% of I-RES? total drawn debt being fixed as at 31 December 2024. I-RES has no debt maturities until April 2026 with laddering out to 2032.    \u00a0    \u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk Trending Since  31 December 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Increasing    The current global economic and geopolitical landscape is characterised by uncertainty and volatility. While the Irish economy continues to be resilient, downside risks have increased due to geopolitical fragmentation, the likelihood of increased incidence of trade tariffs and possible economic trade downturns.    Interest rates in Ireland have moved recently in line with ECB rate changes and predictions for 2025 indicate possible further rate cuts, which is positive. In addition, inflation in Ireland has reduced over 2024 and inflation in 2025 is projected to average around 1.95%, predicated on stable energy prices and moderate wage growth. However, energy costs in Ireland remain high and are expected to rise due to VAT rates, grid fees and carbon taxes. Current uncertainty due to changes in US taxation, trade and tariff policies in respect of major trading partners, including the EU, may negatively impact the Irish economy.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0    \u00a0    \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Operating cost pressures may continue to emerge during 2025 in response to existing inflationary pressures and the lag effect of it moving through the supply chain.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Regulatory and Legislative Impacts     In recent years, changes made to rental property, tax and REIT regulations in Ireland have significantly limited revenue growth, even at times of high inflation. Together these regulatory changes have resulted in some diminution in the attractiveness of the Irish PRS sector and Irish REITs for international investors.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Strategic Impact</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">High    The industry currently faces an environment of increased costs of financing and operation, while at the same time having legislative constraints on revenues through restrictive rental property regulations.\u00a0     Amendments to regulatory restrictions in Ireland, implemented in December 2021, which limit annual rent increases to the lower of HICP and 2% (and extended in May 2024 out to December 2025), continue to impact I-RES? ability to increase rents in line with increasing costs, despite continued high demand for properties and thus, impacts I-RES? attractiveness as an investment vehicle.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mitigation Strategy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">As part of its wider strategy, I-RES is actively engaged with the Irish Government and relevant government departments and regularly contributes to material consultations relevant to the sector. I-RES highlights in these interactions the fact that there is currently a range of structural issues relating to the provision of housing, which is resulting in a supply imbalance in the Irish market. The delivery of affordable residential housing remains a key challenge and there will continue to be a requirement for well capitalised companies who can both fund large scale developments and professionally manage these residential units upon completion.\u00a0\u00a0     I-RES engages a public affairs firm to advise in relation to these matters as well as actively participating in industry groups to ensure ongoing consultation and engagement with relevant authorities, regulators and government departments on significant policy and regulatory matters likely to impact on its affairs.    I-RES takes account of current regulations and rent legislation, as well as the wider economic environment in considering its strategy, its investment decisions and expectations of financial performance and growth.    If any new legislation or regulations are under consideration, the impacts are assessed and I-RES? strategy is adapted accordingly. When legislation is enacted, relevant staff will receive training and education in order to ensure compliance with regulations and legislation.    I-RES also monitors and manages costs keeping in mind any limitations on revenue growth.     \u00a0    \u00a0    \u00a0    \u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk Trending Since     31 December 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Increasing    A new government with a significant majority was elected in January 2025 on a five-year term, which is positive news for the real estate sector as a long-term focus is necessary for housing policy. The Company has continued to advocate for a balanced regulatory system aimed at delivering more homes while still protecting renters and simultaneously attracting institutional capital to address the chronic undersupply of housing, which currently exists in the Irish market. The Company welcomes the Irish Government?s commitment in the ?Programme for Government? to encourage institutional investment, continue with its commitment to review rent regulations and attract private sector capital to its Secure Tenancy Affordable Rental (?STAR?) scheme.    Housing continues to be a significant political issue. Therefore, until such time as the Government gives a clear indication of its final policy intentions in this area the risk continues.    \u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Asset Management and Investment Risk     The risk is that I-RES does not achieve its performance targets due to underperformance of its asset management and investment strategy.\u00a0 At the core of our success is the need to effectively manage the investment and asset management activities we undertake.     Asset management comprises those activities involved in the optimisation of asset values through strategic initiatives in areas such as ongoing investment in the infrastructure to address key deliverables, including building maintenance, energy efficiency, retrofitting and sustainability initiatives. These activities serve to deliver a best-in-class resident experience to support revenue and value maximisation over time.    Investment management involves the ongoing review and optimisation of the portfolio through targeted value adding acquisitions (directly or through joint ventures), development projects (directly or through joint ventures), and disposals with the aim of maximising returns on investment for capital invested through either new investment opportunities or recycling capital from the proceeds of sale from existing portfolio assets.    Investment assets may decrease in value or may require material unanticipated expenditures after acquisition because of unknown risks and conditions at the time of purchase, including structural deficiencies or non-compliance with statutory health and safety standards.    I-RES? ability to execute on asset acquisition opportunities is dependent on its ability to raise new capital either directly or via joint ventures. Investment opportunities in the residential for rent sector are currently limited in the Irish market and as a result, I-RES may not grow its portfolio if there is a lack of new development, acquisition projects or if I-RES is unable to raise new capital sources. If growth opportunities for property portfolio expansion are limited, it may impact I-RES? ability to generate growing returns for its shareholders.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Strategic Impact</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">High    I-RES may not meet its long-term shareholder value growth targets if it cannot continue to grow and optimise its overall portfolio.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mitigation Strategy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">I-RES has deep market knowledge and has established strong industry relationships, which can provide for new growth opportunities. Additionally, I-RES has dedicated staff focused on identifying and evaluating a pipeline of acquisition and development opportunities. These opportunities include partnerships with strategic partners in the form of joint ventures.    I-RES focuses on a three-pronged strategy for growth. This involves direct acquisitions of new assets, development opportunities within existing assets, and partnering with institutional investors and developers in relation to new acquisition opportunities. Where investments are under consideration, the Group carries out financial, legal, operational, technical and environmental due diligence on every investment opportunity to determine if it fits with the Group?s stated investment policy.     \u00a0    There is also ongoing focus on opportunities for capital recycling through the divestment of certain existing assets, where such transactions are value enhancing through targeted divestments, and the appropriate recycling of capital into higher return opportunities and capital investment opportunities within the existing portfolio.    Where divestments are under consideration, the Group carries out financial, legal, operational, technical and environmental due diligence on every divestment opportunity to determine it fits with the Group?s stated investment policy.     Ongoing review is carried out on the anticipated current and future income expectations and operational costs associated with managing the assets.    The Board must approve all material development or investment opportunities prior to commencement and all material contracts are executed by the Board. The CEO and Board reviews and approves investment proposals for over ?1 million, including consideration of risks during the due diligence process. A full review is completed in respect of the anticipated current and future income expectations and operational costs associated with acquiring assets.    I-RES engages subject matter experts in conducting financial, legal, operational, technical and environmental due diligence on every investment opportunity (both acquisitions and development projects) to determine if it fits with I-RES? stated investment policy. I-RES has framework agreements in place with third party experts for conducting technical and engineering studies, and investigations on potential acquisitions, developments, or forward purchase contracts as well as engaging specialist property lawyers to conduct legal due diligence and to advise on purchase and development contracts.    Over the last two years, through the disposal of properties, individual units and non-income earning assets at or above book value and significantly above cost, I-RES has strengthened its balance sheet and the quality of the portfolio.    However, there are clear sectoral issues with the current underlying economic challenges facing residential property developers that are significantly constraining the availability of an active pipeline of relevant development projects. These are driven by factors such as revenue constraints, escalating construction costs, cost inflationary pressures, ongoing planning challenges, an inefficient rental regulation framework and a reduction in available capital to fund acquisitions.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk Trending Since 31 December 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Stable    Standing stock assets with realistic vendor valuation expectations continue to be in limited supply, and new supply continues to come online more slowly than expected.

Interest rate increases and/or property valuation decreases result in higher debt service costs and restriction of future leveraging opportunities due to its regulatory and debt facility covenants requirement to maintain LTV below 50%.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Strategic Impact</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Medium    I-RES is exposed to risks associated with availability of capital (equity and debt) and movements in interest rates on its floating rate bank debt, as well as movements in property valuations.    Significant increases in interest rates and the cost of equity could affect I-RES? cash flow and its ability to meet growth objectives or preserve the value of its existing assets. Elevated interest rates represent a significant downside risk as it impacts on the costs of existing borrowing, the cost of raising new funding and the viability and return available from new opportunities in the market.    Additionally, property valuations are inherently subjective but also driven by market forces. A contraction in property values could impact on gearing levels, which could result in higher interest costs and potential covenant breaches.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mitigation Strategy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">I-RES has a proven record of strong financial results. Strong results, combined with being in a residential sector with a strong underlying market, helps to manage our ability to meet shareholders? expectations and thus, the cost of equity.    As previously noted, I-RES has developed strong relationships with lenders, both in Ireland and internationally, which provide ongoing financing possibilities for I-RES.    I-RES? revolving credit facility is ?500 million with the interest margin fixed at 1.75%, plus the one?month EURIBOR rate. On 11 February 2022, I-RES exercised an option for an extension for the entire facility with a new maturity date of 18 April 2026.    I-RES completed a private placement of notes equivalent to circa ?200 million in March 2020, with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.92% inclusive of swap costs. The notes have a laddered maturity over six, nine, and eleven years, with the first repayment due in 2027. As at 31 December 2024, I-RES has c. ?7 million of cash and ?144 million of committed undrawn debt under its Revolving Credit Facility. I-RES maintains an active programme of engagement with its debt and equity providers, including an ongoing Investor Relations programme.    I-RES? net loan to value ratio was 44.4% as at 31 December 2024, well below the 50% maximum allowed under the Irish REIT rules and the financial covenants under I-RES? debt agreements. I-RES also manages its headroom on its interest coverage ratio.

In 2024, we saw the ECB reduce interest rates four times throughout the year and this momentum has continued in the beginning of 2025, with a further cut in February 2025 and the market forecasting further cuts throughout the year.     The valuation of the portfolio as at 31 December 2024 when compared to year end 2023 has decreased. This was driven by our ongoing asset disposal programme, whilst modest yield expansion resulted in fair value reduction to the portfolio in H1 2024. In the second half of the year, yields have stabilised resulting in like for like valuations broadly in line with 30 June 2024.

Such failures could result in outcomes like service disruptions, unauthorised data access and potentially fraudulent activities involving confidential or non-public business information, or personal data, especially that of I-RES? residents. These incidents could lead to direct losses for stakeholders, penalties for non-compliance, potential third-party liabilities and reputational damage to I-RES. Inadequate security protocols implemented by IT providers may heighten these risks, potentially leading to cybersecurity breaches.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mitigation Strategy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">I-RES continues to monitor through ongoing risk assessments and a yearly assurance program for threats posed from the external cyber risk landscape. We continually invest in our controls and base our Information Security Management System on ISO27001. Across 2024, there has been continuing significant focus on cyber capability and IT resilience, with the embedding of the enhanced Cyber Security Framework that commenced during 2023. This framework forms the basis for future iterations of I-RES? Cyber Strategy.    I-RES is responsible for data privacy and protection as a data processor and remains adaptable either itself or through its sub processors to ongoing technological and legislative change.     Employees receive regular awareness training on cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.    Access to personal data is controlled through physical measures, administrative measures and IT security. I-RES ensures all software is up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities and maintains regular backups of critical systems and data supported by recovery plans to restore operations quickly in the event of an incident.     I-RES maintains cybersecurity insurance coverage and continues to monitor and assess risks surrounding collection, processing, storage, disclosure, transfer, protection and retention/destruction practices for personal data.    Throughout 2024, we continued our investment in technology and infrastructure enhancements and conducted various technology security assessments, including phishing simulations, ransomware testing and vulnerability scans.    \u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_17\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"288\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"336\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk Trending Since 31 December 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Increasing    As technological change continues to develop at a rapid pace, the inherent risks surrounding cybersecurity and data protection also evolve in an accelerated fashion. European Union Data Protection legislation (e.g. General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy) is increasing in prescriptiveness, obligation and administration. New requirements such as those under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) continue to emerge and additionally issues such as vendor risk complexities, phishing and social engineering attempts continue at an accelerated rate due to online criminal ?business models? focusing on high volume/quick hit ransomware deployment and basic financial fraud via wire transfer.     The ongoing advancements and influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) present a range of risks and opportunities that necessitate active management. This management is essential not only to protect the organisation but also to leverage AI's capabilities to enhance performance.

CSRD requires companies to report on the impact of their corporate activities on the environment and society and requires the assurance of reported information.     In addition, as part of our continued focus on climate and environmental sustainability, I-RES has a comprehensive ESG project underway which includes developing decarbonisation pathways, carrying out scenario analysis and ultimately preparing a climate transition plan that will demonstrate I-RES? commitment to achieving a 1.5 degree pathway and how its business model will remain relevant in a net-zero carbon economy.\u00a0\u00a0     Aligning with CSRD will ensure transparent comparable performance data reporting for our stakeholders and, as CSRD aligns with broader global frameworks like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), it ensures our sustainability strategy remains relevant beyond as well as within the EU.    Additionally, I-RES benchmarks its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting against industry benchmarks.

Information Irish Residential Properties REIT plc (?I-RES? or the ?Company?) was incorporated in Ireland on 2 July 2013. On 16 April 2014, I-RES obtained admission of its ordinary shares to the primary listing segment of the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to trading on the main market for listed securities of Euronext Dublin. I-RES? registered office is South Dock House, Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland. The ordinary shares of I-RES are traded on the main market for listed securities of Euronext Dublin under the symbol ?IRES?. Material Accounting Policies  Basis of preparation This financial information has been derived from the information to be used to prepare the Group?s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (?IFRS?), IFRS Interpretations Committee (?IFRIC?) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2014 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial information for the years ended 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023 has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the fair value of investment properties, derivative financial instruments at fair value and share options at grant date through the profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.  The financial information presented herein does not amount to statutory financial statements that are required by Section 347 of the Companies Act 2014 to be annexed to the annual return of the Group. The financial information does not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements. The purpose of this financial information is for the provision of information to shareholders. The statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been attached to the annual return of the Company and filed with the Registrar of Companies. The audit report on those statutory financial statements was unqualified and did not contain any matters to which attention was drawn by way of emphasis. The statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 will be annexed to the next annual return of the Group and filed with the Registrar of Companies. This announcement has been prepared on the basis of the results and financial position that the Directors expect will be reflected in the audited statutory accounts when these are completed. The preliminary announcement has been approved by the Board of Directors. It is expected that the annual report and statutory consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 will be approved by the Directors and reported on by the auditors in March 2025. The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared on a going concern basis of accounting. The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been presented in Euro, which is the Company?s functional currency.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group cover the 12-month period from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024. The Group has not early adopted any forthcoming International Accounting Standards Board (?IASB?) standards. Note 2(s) sets out details of such upcoming standards. Going concern The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its cash and deposit balances. The Group?s plans indicate that it should have adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future. The Group has a strong consolidated statement of financial position with sufficient liquidity and flexibility in place to manage through the potential headwinds in the current market. The Group can draw an additional ?61 million from its RCF (as defined below in note 10) while maintaining a maximum 50% Loan to value ratio as at 31 December 2024, as required by REIT legislation. As at 31 December 2024, the undrawn RCF amount is ?144 million. The Group generated positive cashflows from operations for the year ended 31 December 2024. Accordingly, the Directors consider it appropriate that the Group adopts the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. \u00a0 \u00a0 ?2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of I-RES and its subsidiaries, IRES Residential Properties Limited, IRES Fund Management Limited, IRES Residential Properties (Tara View) Limited and IRES Residential Properties (Orion) Limited. I-RES controls these subsidiaries by virtue of its 100% shareholding in the companies. All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. \u00a0 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by I-RES. I-RES controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the entity. The financial information of subsidiaries (except owners? management companies) is included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. I-RES does not consolidate owners? management companies in which it holds majority voting rights. For further details, please refer to note 23. Investment properties and investment properties under development Investment properties  The Group considers its income properties to be investment properties under IAS 40, Investment Property (?IAS 40?) and has chosen the fair value model to account for its investment properties in the consolidated financial statements. Under IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement (?IFRS 13?), fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. \u00a0 Investment properties are treated as acquired at the time when the Group assumes the significant risks and returns of ownership, which normally occurs when the conveyancing contract has been performed by both buyer and seller and the contract has been deemed to have become unconditional and completed. Investment properties are deemed to have been acquired when the buyer has assumed control of ownership and the contract has been completed.  \u00a0 Investment properties comprise investment interests held in land and buildings (including integral equipment) held for the purpose of producing rental income, capital appreciation or both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business. \u00a0 All investment properties are initially recorded at cost, which includes transaction and other acquisition costs, at their respective acquisition dates and are subsequently stated at fair value at each reporting date, with any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value recognised through profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the period. Gains and losses (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) arising on the disposal of investment properties are also recognised through profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ?2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investment properties and investment properties under development (continued) \u00a0 The fair value of investment properties is determined by qualified independent valuers at each reporting date, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (?RICS?) Valuation Standards and IFRS 13. Each independent valuer holds a recognised relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the locations and segments of the investment properties valued. At each reporting date, management undertakes a review of its investment property valuations to assess the continuing validity of the underlying assumptions, such as future income streams and yields used in the independent valuation report, as well as property valuation movements when compared to the prior year valuation report and holds discussions with the independent valuer. \u00a0 Investment properties under development Investment properties under development include those properties, or components thereof, that will undergo activities that will take a substantial period of time to prepare the properties for their intended use as income properties.  \u00a0 The cost of a development property that is an asset acquisition comprises the amount of cash, or the fair value of other consideration, paid to acquire the property, including transaction costs. Subsequent to the acquisition, the cost of a development property includes costs that are directly attributable to these assets, including development costs and borrowing costs. These costs are capitalised when the activities necessary to prepare an asset for development or redevelopment begin and continue until the date that construction is substantially complete and all necessary occupancy and related permits have been received, whether or not the space is leased. Borrowing costs are calculated using the Company?s weighted average cost of borrowing. \u00a0 Properties under development are valued at fair value by qualified independent valuers at each reporting date with fair value adjustments recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. In the case of investment property under development, the valuation approach applied is the ?residual method?, with a deduction for the costs necessary to complete the development together with an allowance for the remaining risk. \u00a0 Development land Development land is also stated at fair value by qualified independent valuers at each reporting date with fair value adjustments recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. In the case of development land, the valuation approach applied is the comparable sales approach, which considers recent sales activity for similar land parcels in the same or similar markets. Land values are estimated using either a per acre or per buildable square foot basis based on highest and best use. Such values are applied to the Group?s properties after adjusting for factors specific to the site, including its location, highest and best use, zoning, servicing and configuration. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ?2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investment properties and investment properties under development (continued) \u00a0 Key estimations of inherent uncertainty in investment property valuations  The fair values derived are based on anticipated market values for the properties, being the estimated amount that would be received from a sale of the assets in an orderly transaction between market participants. The valuation of the Group?s investment property portfolio is inherently subjective as it requires, among other factors, assumptions to be made regarding the ability of existing residents to meet their rental obligations over the entire life of their leases, the estimation of the expected rental income in the future, an assessment of a property?s ability to remain an attractive technical configuration to existing and prospective residents in a changing market and a judgement to be reached on the attractiveness of a building, its location and the surrounding environment. While these and other similar matters are market-standard considerations in determining the fair value of a property in accordance with the RICS methodology, they are all subjective assessments of future outturns and macroeconomic factors, which are outside of the Group?s control or influence and therefore may prove to be inaccurate long-term forecasts.  \u00a0 As a result of all these factors, the ultimate valuation the Group places on its investment properties is subject to some uncertainty and may not turn out to be accurate, particularly in times of macroeconomic volatility. The RICS property valuation methodology is considered by the Board to be the valuation technique most suited to the measurement of the fair value of property investments. It is also the primary measurement of fair value that all major and reputable property market participants use when valuing a property investment. See note 5 for a detailed discussion of the significant assumptions, estimates and valuation methods used. \u00a0 Property asset acquisition  At the time of acquisition of a property or a portfolio of investment properties, the Group evaluates whether the acquisition is a business combination or asset acquisition. The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.  \u00a0 The Group has an option to apply a ?concentration test? that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. \u00a0 When an acquisition does not represent a business as defined under IFRS 3, the Group classifies these properties, or portfolio of properties, as an asset acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an asset acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related transaction costs are capitalised to the property. Property, plant and equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and mainly comprise of the leased head office, head office fixtures and fittings and information technology hardware. These items are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives; the right of use building has a useful life of 20 years and the fixtures and fittings have a useful life ranging from one to five years. \u00a0 ?2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (?IFRS 9?) Financial assets and financial liabilities Under IFRS 9, financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently accounted for based on their classification as described below. Their classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired or issued, their characteristics and I-RES? designation of such instruments. The standard requires that all financial assets and financial liabilities be classified as fair value through profit or loss (?FVTPL?), amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (?FVTOCI?). \u00a0 Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities\u00a0 The Group derecognises a financial asset when: ?\u00a0the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or ?\u00a0it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either: ?\u00a0 substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or ?\u00a0 the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. \u00a0 When the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its consolidated statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognised. \u00a0 The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. \u00a0 On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss. \u00a0 Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. \u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?f)\u00a0\u00a0 IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (?IFRS 9?)

Interest earned or accrued on these financial assets is included in other income. \u00a0 Other receivables Such receivables arise when I-RES provides services to a third party, such as a resident, and are included in current assets, except for those with maturities more than 12 months after the consolidated statement of financial position date, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and other receivables are included in other assets initially at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position and are subsequently accounted for at amortised cost. \u00a0 Other liabilities Such financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently accounted for at amortised cost and include all liabilities other than derivatives. Derivatives are at fair value through other comprehensive income. \u00a0 FVTPL Financial instruments in this category are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are presented within gain on derivative financial instruments in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL are classified as current, except for the portion expected to be realised or paid more than 12 months after the consolidated statement of financial position date, which is classified as non-current. Derivatives are categorised as FVTPL unless designated as hedges. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?f)\u00a0\u00a0 IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (?IFRS 9?) (continued) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting  The Group utilises derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. \u00a0 Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are remeasured at fair value, with changes generally recognised through profit or loss. \u00a0 The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. \u00a0 At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other. \u00a0 Cash flow hedges When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, hedge accounting is used in line with IFRS 9. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income (?OCI?) and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. \u00a0 For all hedged forecast transactions, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is reclassified to financing costs in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. \u00a0 If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. \u00a0 If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. IFRS 16, Leases At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?g)\u00a0\u00a0 IFRS 16, Leases (continued) As a lessee When the Group acts as a lessee, at commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. \u00a0 The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.  \u00a0 The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.  \u00a0 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group?s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.  \u00a0 The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and the type of asset leased. \u00a0 Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: ?\u00a0fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; ?\u00a0variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; ?\u00a0amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and ?\u00a0the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. \u00a0 The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group?s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. \u00a0 When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded through profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.  \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?g)\u00a0\u00a0 IFRS 16, Leases (continued) \u00a0 The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in ?Property, plant and equipment? and lease liabilities in ?Lease liability? in the statement of financial position. \u00a0 As a lessor  When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying assets. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of the assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset, the present value of lease payments and any option included in the lease. The Group has determined that all of its leases are operating leases.  \u00a0 When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. \u00a0 On modification of a contract that contains a lease component and a non-lease component, I-RES allocates the consideration in the contract to each of the components on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\u00a0  \u00a0 Tenant inducements Incentives such as cash, rent-free periods and move-in allowances may be provided to lessees who enter into a lease. The incentives are written off on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease as a reduction of rental revenue. \u00a0 Early termination of leases When the Group receives rent loss payments from a tenant for the early termination of a lease, it is reflected in the accounting period in which the rent loss payment occurred.  \u00a0 Expected credit loss (?ECL?) The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and other financial assets. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. Loss allowances for trade receivables (including lease receivables) are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group?s historical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking information. \u00a0 The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due. \u00a0 For individual residential customers, the Group has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 30 days past due based on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (?IFRS 15?) I-RES retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of its investment properties and therefore accounts for leases with its tenants as operating leases. Rent represents lease revenue earned from the conveyance of the right to use the property, including access to common areas, to a lessee for an agreed period of time. The contract also contains a performance obligation that requires I-RES to maintain the common areas to an agreed standard. This right of use and performance obligation is governed by a single rental contract with the tenant. In accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, I-RES has evaluated the lease and non-lease components of its rental revenue and has determined that common area maintenance services constitute a single non-lease element, which is accounted for as one performance obligation under IFRS 15 and is recognised separately to Rental Income as revenue under IFRS 15. \u00a0 Rental revenue includes amounts earned from tenants under the rental contract which are allocated to the lease and non-lease components based on relative stand-alone selling prices.\u00a0The stand-alone selling prices of the lease components are determined using an adjusted market assessment approach and the stand-alone selling prices of the service components are determined using the input method based on the expected costs plus an estimated market-based margin for similar services.  \u00a0 Rental income from the operating lease component is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases.\u00a0When I-RES provides incentives to its tenants, the cost of such incentives is recognised over the lease term, on a straight-line basis, as a reduction of revenue. \u00a0 Revenue from maintenance services represents the service component of the REIT?s rental contracts and is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15.\u00a0These services consist primarily of the recovery of utilities, property and other common area maintenance and amenity costs where I-RES has determined it is acting as a principal.  \u00a0 These services constitute a single non-lease component, which is accounted for as one performance obligation under IFRS 15 as the individual activities that comprise these services are not distinct in the context of the contract. The individual activities undertaken to meet the performance obligation may vary from time to time but cumulatively the activities undertaken to meet the performance obligation are relatively consistent over time. The tenant simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided under the performance obligation as I-RES performs the obligation and consequently revenue is recognised over time, typically on a monthly basis, as the services are provided.  Operating segments The Group operates and is managed as one business segment, namely property investment, with all investment properties located in Ireland. The operating segment is reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker, which has been identified as the I-RES Board. Statement of cash flows Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and balances with banks. Investing and financing activities that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents are excluded from the consolidated statement of cash flows and are disclosed separately in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Interest paid is classified as financing activities.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) Income taxes Current tax Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.  \u00a0 Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.  \u00a0 I-RES elected for REIT status on 31 March 2014. As a result, from that date I-RES does not pay Irish corporation tax on the profits and gains from its qualifying rental business in Ireland, provided it meets certain conditions. \u00a0 Corporation tax is payable in the normal way in respect of income and gains from any residual business (generally including any property trading business) not included in the Property Rental Business. I-RES is liable to pay other taxes such as VAT, stamp duty, land tax, local property tax and payroll taxes in the normal way.  \u00a0 Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.  \u00a0 The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Equity and share issue costs The equity of I-RES consists of ordinary shares issued. Shares issued are recorded at the date of issuance. Direct issue costs in respect of the issue of shares are accounted for as a deduction from retained earnings. The excess consideration for shares above nominal value is recorded as share premium.  Net asset value (?NAV?) The NAV is calculated as the value of the Group?s assets less the value of its liabilities, measured in accordance with IFRS and in particular will include the Group?s property assets at their fair value assessed independently by valuers.  Share-based payments I-RES has determined that the options and restricted share units issued to senior executives qualify as ?equity-settled share-based payment transactions? as per IFRS 2. In addition, any options issued to the directors and employees also qualify as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of the options measured on the grant date will be expensed over the graded vesting term with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value for all options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?n)\u00a0\u00a0 Share-based payments (continued) \u00a0 The grant-date fair value of restricted share units issued to senior employees is generally recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The fair value for all restricted share units granted is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. Property taxes Property taxes are paid annually and recognised as an expense evenly throughout the year.  Security deposits Security deposits are amounts received from tenants at the beginning of a tenancy. When a tenant is no longer in occupancy, the Group will assess whether there was damage to the property above normal wear and tear for which deductions may be made to their deposit. Once the inspections and repairs are calculated, the remaining security deposit is returned to the tenant. Pension The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees.\u00a0A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which a company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid, the Company has no further obligations. The contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due. The amounts that are not paid are shown as accruals in the consolidated statement of financial position. The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.  Assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that the assets will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.  \u00a0 Such assets are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial calculation as held-for-sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Material Accounting Policies (continued) Impact expected from new or amended standards The following standards and amendments are under review and are not expected to have a significant impact on reported results or disclosures of the Group. They were not effective at the financial year end 31 December 2024 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The Group will apply the new standards from the effective date. The potential impact of these standards on the Group is under review. \u00a0 Lack of Exchangeability ? Amendments to IAS 21 Effective Date 1 January 2025 \u00a0 Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments ? Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 Effective Date 1 January 2026 \u00a0 IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements Effective Date 1 January 2027 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Critical Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgements that in some cases relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and which affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas of such estimation include, but are not limited to, valuation of investment properties and valuation of financial instruments. Changes to estimates and assumptions may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.  The valuation estimate of investment properties is deemed to be significant. See note 19(a) and note 5 for a detailed discussion of valuation methods and the significant assumptions and estimates used.

The Group uses Savills and CBRE as external independent valuers. The Group?s investment property is rotated between these valuers on a periodic basis. The valuers fair valued all of the Group?s investment properties as at 31 December 2024. The valuers employ qualified valuation professionals who have recent experience in the location and category of the respective properties. Valuations are prepared on a bi-annual basis at the interim reporting date and the annual reporting date. The information provided to the valuers and the assumptions, valuation methodologies and models used by the valuers, are reviewed by management. The valuers meet with the Audit Committee and discuss directly the valuation results as at 30 June and 31 December. The Board determines the Group?s valuation policies and procedures for property valuations. The Board decides which independent valuers to appoint for the external valuation of the Group?s properties. Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. Investment property producing income For investment property producing income, the income approach/yield methodology involves applying market-derived yields to current and projected future income streams. These yields and future income streams are derived from comparable property transactions and are considered to be the key inputs in the valuation. Other factors that are taken into account include the tenure of the lease, tenancy details and planning, building and environmental factors that might affect the property. Development land In the case of development land, the approach applied is the comparable sales approach, which considers recent sales activity for similar land parcels in the same or similar markets. Land values are estimated using either a per acre or per buildable square foot basis based on highest and best use. Such values are applied to the Group?s properties after adjusting for factors specific to the site, including its location, zoning, servicing and configuration. Assets held for sale At 31 December 2024, I-RES has identified 13 units across 5 properties as assets held for sale amounting to ?4.0 million. Management has committed to a plan to sell these properties, which are available for immediate sale, and we expect the disposals to close in the next twelve months. Information about fair value measurements using unobservable inputs (Level 3) At 31 December 2024, the Group considers that all of its investment properties fall within Level 3 fair value as defined by IFRS 13. As outlined in IFRS 13, a Level 3 fair value recognises that the significant inputs and considerations made in determining the fair value of property investments cannot be derived from publicly available data, as the valuation methodology in respect of a property also has to rely on a number of unobservable inputs including technical reports, legal data, building costs, rental analysis (including rent moratorium), professional opinion on profile, lot size, layout and presentation of accommodation. In addition, the valuers utilise proprietary databases maintained in respect of properties similar to the assets being valued. The Group tests the reasonableness of all significant unobservable inputs, including yields and stabilised net rental income (?Stabilised NRI?) used in the valuation and reviews the results with the independent valuers for all valuations. The Stabilised NRI represents cash flows from property revenue less property operating expenses, adjusted for market-based assumptions such as market rents, short term and long term vacancy rates, bad debts, management fees and repairs and maintenance. These cashflows are estimates for current and projected future income streams. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ?5.\u00a0\u00a0 Investment Properties (continued) Sensitivity analysis Stabilised NRI and ?Equivalent Yields? are key inputs in the valuation model used.  Equivalent Yield is the rate of return on a property investment based on current and projected future income streams that such property investment will generate. This is derived by the external valuers and is used to set the term and reversionary yields. For example, completed properties are valued mainly using a term and reversion model. For the existing rental contract or term, estimated Stabilised NRI is based on the expected rents from residents over the period to the next lease break option or expiry. After this period, the reversion, estimated Stabilised NRI is based on expectations from current market conditions. Thus, a decrease in the estimated Stabilised NRI will decrease the fair value and an increase in the estimated Stabilised NRI will increase the fair value. The Equivalent Yields magnify the effect of a change in Stabilised NRI, with a lower yield resulting in a greater effect on the fair value of investment properties than a higher Equivalent Yield. For investment properties producing income, properties held for sale and investment properties under development, an increase of 1% in the Equivalent Yield would have the impact of a ?179 million reduction in fair value while a decrease of 1% in the Equivalent Yield would result in a fair value increase of ?253 million. An increase between 1% - 4% in Stabilised NRI would result in a fair value increase extending from ?12 million to ?49 million respectively in fair value, while a decrease between 1% - 4% in Stabilised NRI would have an impact ranging from ?12 million to ?49 million reduction respectively. I-RES believes that this range of change in Stabilised NRI is a reasonable estimate in the next twelve months based on expected changes in net rental income. The direct operating expenses recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the Group is ?19.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: ?19.9 million), arising from investment property that generated rental income during the period. The direct operating expenses are comprised of the following significant categories: property taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, wages, insurance, service charges and IT costs. The direct operating expenses recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income arising from investment property that did not generate rental income for the year ended 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023 was not material. An investment property is comprised of various components, including undeveloped land and vacant residential and commercial units; no direct operating costs were specifically allocated to these separate components. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 Investment Properties (continued) Quantitative information A summary of the Equivalent Yields and ranges along with the fair value of the total portfolio of the Group as at 31 December 2024 is presented below: As at 31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_27\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Type of Interest</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Fair Value    ?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">WA Stabilised NRI(1)    ?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Rate Type(2)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Max.</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Min.</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Weighted Average</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Income properties(4)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,226,995</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,273</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Equivalent Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">6.54%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">4.77%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">5.89%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Development land(3)\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5,200</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">n/a</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Market Comparable (per sq ft.)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?95.4</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?44.5</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">?82.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total investment properties(4)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,232,195</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(1)\u00a0WA Stabilised NRI is the NRI of each property weighted by its fair value over the total fair value of the investment properties (?WA NRI?).

There are commitment fees charged on the undrawn loan amount of the RCF. The effective interest rate for the RCF during the year was 4.78% (2023: 4.46%). On 14 December 2022, I-RES entered into hedging arrangements to fix the interest cost on ?275m of the RCF. See further details in note 18.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ?10.\u00a0Bank indebtedness (continued) On 11 February 2022, the Company exercised an option for an extension with all five banks (Ulster Bank Ireland DAC, The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c., Barclays Bank Ireland PLC and HSBC Continental Europe) for the entire ?600 million facility with a new maturity date of 18 April 2026. On 22 December 2023, the Company served a notice of cancellation per the agreement to reduce the facility by ?100m with effect from 4 January 2024, thus reducing the overall facility to ?500 million. The financial covenants in relation to the RCF principally relate to Loan to Value and Interest Cover Ratio. I-RES has complied with all its debt financial covenants to which it was subject during the period. Gross Loan to Value has remained below the required 50% at 45.0%. In November 2023, the Company agreed with the RCF syndicate and Private Placement Noteholders to amend the current Interest Cover covenant from 200% to 175% until maturity of the RCF in April 2026. Interest Cover has remained above the requirement of 175% at 242% for the year ended 31 December 2024. Private Placement Notes On 11 March 2020, I-RES successfully closed the issue of ?130 million notes and IRES Residential Properties Limited, its subsidiary, closed the issue of USD $75 million notes on a private placement basis (collectively, the ?Notes?). The Notes have a weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.92% inclusive of a USD/Euro swap and an effective interest rate of 2.07%. Interest is paid semi-annually on 10 March and 10 September. The Notes have been placed in four tranches:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_38\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"24\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">As at</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">31 December 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Maturity</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Contractual interest rate</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Derivative Rates</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EUR Series A Senior Secured Notes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10 March 2030</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.83%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">n/a</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">90,000</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">90,000</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EUR Series B Senior Secured Notes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10 March 2032</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.98%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">n/a</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">40,000</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">40,000</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">USD Series A Senior Secured Notes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10 March 2027</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.44%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.87%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">48,277</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">45,261</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">(1)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">USD Series B Senior Secured Notes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10 March 2030</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.63%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2.25%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">24,138</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">22,631</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">(2)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">202,415</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">197,892</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deferred financing costs, net</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">(1,424)</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">(1,767)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">200,991</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">196,125</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(1)\u00a0The principal amount of the USD Series A Senior Secured Notes is USD $50 million.

There is between a 24 month and 61 month holding period post vesting, but this is not subject to measurement as all conditions terminate on vesting. The LTIP awards are measured as follows: Market-based condition: The expected performance of I-RES shares over the vesting period is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Inputs are share price volatility for I-RES and the average growth rate. These inputs are calculated with reference to relevant historical data and financial models. It should be recognised that the assumption of an average growth rate is not a prediction of the actual level of returns that will be achieved. The volatility assumption in the distribution gives a measure of the range of outcomes that may occur on either side of this average value. This is used to amortise the fair value of an expected cost over the vesting period. On vesting, any difference in amounts accrued versus actual is amended through reserves.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ?12.\u00a0Share-based Compensation (continued) Non-market-based conditions: The fair value of the shares to be issued is determined using the grant date market price. The expected number of shares is calculated based on the expectations of the number of shares which may vest at the vesting date and amortised over the vesting period. At each reporting date, the calculation of the number of shares is revised according to current expectations or performance.  The awards are subject to various criteria as outlined in the table above. The TSR measure is relative to constituents of the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Europe Developed Index for the 2021-2022 awards. The 2023 and 2024 awards are relative to the residential subsector of this index for TSR.

Shareholders' Equity All equity shares outstanding are fully paid and are voting shares. Equity shares represent a shareholder?s proportionate undivided beneficial interest in I-RES. No equity share has any preference or priority over another. No shareholder has or is deemed to have any right of ownership in any of the assets of I-RES. Each share confers the right to cast one vote at any meeting of shareholders and to participate pro rata in any distributions by I-RES and, in the event of termination of I-RES, in the net assets of I-RES remaining after satisfaction of all liabilities. Shares are to be issued in registered form and are transferable.

Revenue from Investment Properties I-RES generates revenue primarily from the rental income from investment properties. Rental income represents lease revenue earned from the conveyance of the right to use the property, including access to common areas, to a lessee for an agreed period of time. The rental contract also contains an undertaking that common areas and amenities will be maintained to a certain standard. This right of use of the property and maintenance performance obligation is governed by a single rental contract with the tenant. I-RES has evaluated the lease and non-lease components of its rental revenue and has determined that common area maintenance services constitute a single non-lease element, which is accounted for as one performance obligation under IFRS 15 and is recognised separately to Rental Income.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_45\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"216\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the year ended</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31 December 2024    ?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31 December 2023    ?'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Rental Income</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">73,210</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">75,004</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue from services</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10,185</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11,001</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Car park income</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,878</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,849</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue from contracts with customers</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12,063</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">12,850</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">85,273</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">87,854</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 General and Administrative Expenses</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_46\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"216\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the year ended</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31 December 2024    ?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31 December 2023    ?'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">General and administrative expenses</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11,935</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11,747</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total recurring general and administrative expenses</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11,935</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11,747</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Non-recurring costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3,411</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">939</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total General and administrative expenses</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15,346</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">12,686</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">General and administrative expenses include costs such as director fees, executives? and employees? salaries, professional fees for audit, legal and advisory services, depositary fees, property valuation fees, insurance costs and other general and administrative expenses.

This hedging agreement is accounted for as a cashflow hedge in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Hedges are measured for effectiveness at each reporting date with the effective portion being recognised in equity in the hedging reserve and the ineffective portion being recognised through profit or loss within financing costs. For the year ended 31 December 2024 the ineffective portion that has been recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income was a loss of ?104,000 (31 December 2023: gain of ?86,000). The fair value of the effective portion of ?4,095,000 (31 December 2023: loss of ?3,035,000) was included in the cash flow hedge reserve along with a gain on hedging of ?418,000 (31 December 2023: gain on hedging of ?362,000). The fair value of the cash flow hedge was an asset of ?2,767,000 and a liability of ?nil at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: asset of ?969,000 and liability of ?1,594,000). Interest rate swap On 14 December 2022, I-RES entered into hedging arrangements in respect of its RCF, specifically interest rate swap agreements aggregating to ?275 million until maturity of the facility, converting this portion of the facility into a fixed interest rate of 2.5% plus margin of 1.75%. For the year ended 31 December 2024, the fair value of the effective portion of ?1,730,000 (31 December 2023: loss of ?3,125,000) has been recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of ?3,000 and a liability of ?1,557,000 at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: asset of ?1,910,000 and liability of ?2,073,000). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Financial Instruments, Investment Properties and Risk Management  Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Investment Properties The Group classifies and discloses the fair value for each class of financial instrument based on the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market value data obtained from independent sources and the Group?s own assumptions about market value. The hierarchy levels are defined below: Level 1 - Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  Level 2 - Inputs based on factors other than quoted prices included in Level 1 and may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals; and  Level 3 - Inputs which are unobservable for the asset or liability and are typically based on the Group?s own assumptions as there is little, if any, related market activity.  The Group?s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The following table presents the Group?s estimates of fair value on a recurring basis based on information available as at 31 December 2024, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.  As at 31 December 2024, the fair value of the Group?s private placement debt is estimated to be ?175.3 million (31 December 2023: ?168.4 million) due to changes in interest rates since the private placement debt was issued and the impact of the passage of time on the fixed rate of the private placement debt. The fair value of the private placement debt is based on discounted future cash flows using rates that reflect current rates for similar financial instruments with similar duration, terms and conditions, which are considered Level 2 inputs. The private placement debt is recorded at amortised cost of ?201.0 million (31 December 2023: ?196.1 million). \u00a0 As at 31 December 2024, the fair value of the Group?s RCF is estimated to be ?356.9 million (31 December 2023: ?373.4 million). The fair value is based on the margin rate and EURIBOR forward curve at the reporting date. The RCF is recorded at amortised cost of ?355.2 million at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: ?371.3 million). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ?19.\u00a0 Financial Instruments, Investment Properties and Risk Management (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Investment Properties (continued)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_48\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">As at 31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Level 1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Level 2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Level 3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Significant other observable inputs</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Significant unobservable inputs(1)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Total</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Recurring Measurements ?

(2)\u00a0The valuation of the interest rate swap instrument is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivatives. The fair value is determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted variable cash receipts of the derivatives. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rates. If the total mark-to-market value is positive, I-RES will include a current value adjustment to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty and if the total mark-to-market value is negative, I-RES will include a current value adjustment to reflect I-RES' own credit risk in the fair value measurement of the interest rate swap agreements. (3)\u00a0The cross-currency swaps are valued by constructing the cash flows of each side and then discounting them back to the present using appropriate discount factors, including consideration of credit risk, in those currencies. The cash flows of the more liquid quoted currency pair will be discounted using standard discount factors, while the cash flows of the less liquid currency pair will be discounted using cross-currency basis-adjusted discount factors. Following discounting, the spot rate will be used to convert the present value amount of the non-valuation currency into the valuation currency. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ?19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial Instruments, Investment Properties and Risk Management (continued) Risk Management The main risks arising from the Group?s financial instruments are market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group?s approach to managing these risks is summarised as follows: Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices. Market risk reflects interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risks.  The Group?s financial assets currently comprise short-term bank deposits, trade receivables, deposits on acquisition and derivatives.  Short-term bank deposits are held to meet the cash flow needs of the Group. These are denominated in Euro. Therefore, exposure to market risk in relation to these is limited to interest rate risk. The Group also has private placement notes that are denoted in USD. The Group?s risk management strategy is to mitigate foreign exchange variability to the extent that it is practicable and cost effective to do so. The Group utilises cross currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk associated with the Group?s existing, fixed foreign-currency denominated borrowings. The use of cross-currency interest rate swaps is consistent with the Group?s risk management strategy to effectively eliminate variability in the Group?s functional currency equivalent cash flows on a portion of its borrowings due to variability in the USD-EUR exchange rate. The hedges protect the Group against adverse variability in foreign exchange rates and the effective portion is recognised in equity in the hedging reserve, with the ineffective portion being recognised through profit or loss within financing costs. Derivatives designated as hedges against foreign exchange risks are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Hedges are measured for effectiveness at each accounting date and the accounting treatment of changes in fair value revised accordingly. Specifically, the Company is hedging (1) the foreign exchange risk on the USD interest payments and (2) the foreign exchange risk on the USD principal repayment of the USD borrowings at maturity. This hedging relationship qualifies for foreign currency cash flow hedge accounting. On 12 February 2020, I-RES entered into cross-currency swaps to (i) exchange the USD loan of USD $75 million into ?68.9 million effective 11 March 2020 and (ii) convert the fixed interest rate on the USD loan to a fixed Euro interest rate, maturing on 10 March 2027 and 10 March 2030.  At the inception of the hedging relationship the Company has identified the following potential sources of hedge ineffectiveness: Movements in the Company?s and hedging counterparty?s credit spread that would result in movements in fair value of the hedging instrument that would not be reflected in the movements in the value of the hedged transactions.  The possibility of changes to the critical terms (e.g. reset dates, index mismatches, payment dates) of the hedged transaction due to a refinancing or debt renegotiation such that they no longer match those of the hedging instrument. The Company would reflect such mismatch when modelling the hypothetical derivative and this could be a potential source of hedge ineffectiveness. Whilst sources of ineffectiveness do exist in the hedging relationship, the Company expects changes in value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction to offset and systematically move in opposite directions given that the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged transactions are closely aligned at inception as described above. Therefore, the Company has qualitatively concluded that there is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction in accordance with IFRS 9. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. In general, under these agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events.

IBOR reform does not impact the Group?s risk management and hedge accounting. The Group has EURIBOR on its RCF, which is not impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform.  Interest Rate Risk With regard to the cost of borrowing I-RES has used and may continue to use hedging where considered appropriate, to mitigate interest rate risk. As at 31 December 2024, I-RES? RCF was drawn for ?355.9 million. The interest on the RCF is paid at a rate of 1.75% per annum plus the one-month or three-month EURIBOR rate (at the option of I-RES) or at a floor of zero if EURIBOR is negative. As previously noted, on 14 December 2022, I-RES entered into interest rate swaps in respect of its RCF, aggregating to ?275 million until maturity of the facility, converting this portion of the facility into a fixed interest rate of 2.5% plus margin of 1.75%. As of the year end, approximately 85% of the Company's drawn debt is now fixed against interest rate volatility. The Company?s private placement debt has a fixed rate of 1.92%. For the year ended 31 December 2024, a 100-basis point change in 1 month Euribor interest rates across the period would have had the following effect:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_54\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">As at 31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Change in interest rates</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Increase/(decrease) in net income</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Basis Points</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EURIBOR rate debt(1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+100</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(968)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EURIBOR rate debt(1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-100</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0968</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(1)\u00a0Based on the fixed margin of 1.75% plus the 1-month EURIBOR during year ended 31 December 2024 and a hedged interest rate of 2.50% for the period interest rate swaps in place. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ?19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial Instruments, Investment Properties and Risk Management (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk management (continued) \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_55\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">As at 31 December 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Change in interest rates</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Increase (decrease) in net income</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Basis Points</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EURIBOR rate debt(1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+100</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(1,597)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EURIBOR rate debt(1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-100</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,597</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(1)\u00a0Based on the fixed margin of 1.75% plus the 1-month EURIBOR rate during year ended 31 December 2023 and a hedged interest rate of 2.50% for the quantum and period of interest rate swaps in place. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulties in accessing capital markets and refinancing its financial obligations as they come due. The Group?s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group?s reputation. The Group monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade and other receivables, together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables and capital commitments.

(4)\u00a0Based on 1-month EURIBOR forward curve as at 31 December 2023. \u00a0 The carrying value of bank indebtedness and trade and other payables (other liabilities) approximates their fair value. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that: (i) counterparties to contractual financial obligations will default; or (ii) the possibility that the Group?s tenants may experience financial difficulty and be unable to meet their rental obligations.  The Group monitors its risk exposure regarding obligations with counterparties through the regular assessment of counterparties? credit positions. The Group mitigates the risk of credit loss with respect to tenants by evaluating the creditworthiness of new tenants and obtaining security deposits wherever permitted by legislation. The Group monitors its collection experience on a monthly basis and ensures that a stringent policy is adopted to provide for all past due amounts. All residential accounts receivable balances exceeding 30 days are written off to bad debt expense and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The Group?s allowance for expected credit loss amounted to a charge of ?145,000 for the year ended 31 December 2024 and is recorded as part of property operating costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (31 December 2023: gain of ?90,000). Cash and cash equivalents are held with major Irish and European institutions which have credit ratings between A- and A+. The Company deposits cash with a number of individual institutions to avoid concentration of risk with any one counterparty. The Group has also engaged the services of a depository to ensure the security of cash assets. Risk of counterparty default arising on derivative financial instruments is controlled by dealing with high-quality institutions and by a policy limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one bank or institution. Derivative financial instrument counter parties have credit ratings in the range of A- to A+. \u00a0 \u00a0 ?19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial Instruments, Investment Properties and Risk Management (continued) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risk management (continued) Capital management The Group?s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, I-RES may issue new shares or consider the sale of assets to reduce debt. I-RES, through the Irish REIT Regime, is restricted in its use of capital to making investments in real estate property in Ireland. I-RES intends to continue to make distributions if its results of operations and cash flows permit in the future. The Board?s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. At 31 December 2024, capital consists of equity and debt and Group Net LTV was 44.4% (2023: 44.3%). I-RES seeks to use gearing to enhance shareholder returns over the long term. The level of gearing is monitored carefully by the Board. The Board monitors the return on capital as well as the level of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. Subject to distributable reserves, it is the policy of I-RES to distribute at least 85% of the Property Income of its Property Rental Business for each accounting period as required under the REIT legislation. Taxation I-RES elected for REIT status on 31 March 2014. As a result, from that date the Group is exempt from paying Irish corporation tax on the profits and gains it makes from qualifying rental businesses in Ireland provided it meets certain conditions. Instead, dividends paid to shareholders in respect of the Property Rental Business are treated for Irish tax purposes as income in the hands of shareholders. Corporation tax is still payable in the normal way in respect of income and gains from any residual business (generally including any property trading business) not included in the Property Rental Business. I-RES is also liable to pay other taxes such as VAT, stamp duty, local property tax and payroll taxes in the normal way. Within the Irish REIT Regime, for corporation tax purposes the Property Rental Business is treated as a separate business from the residual business. A loss incurred by the Property Rental Business cannot be offset against profits of the residual business. An Irish REIT is required, subject to having sufficient distributable reserves, to distribute to its shareholders (by way of dividend), on or before the filing date for its tax return for the accounting period in question, at least 85% of the Property Income of the Property Rental Business arising in each accounting period. Failure to meet this requirement would result in a tax charge calculated by reference to the extent of the shortfall in the dividend paid. A dividend paid by an Irish REIT from its Property Rental Business is referred to as a property income distribution. Any normal dividend paid from the residual business by the Irish REIT is referred to as a non-property income distribution dividend. The Directors confirm that the Group has remained in compliance with the Irish REIT Regime up to and including the date of this Report.

This arose on the profit on disposal of the Rockbrook site. CGT was payable on this as the site constituted a disposal of an asset of the residual business as opposed to the property rental business of the Group.  There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of ?19,800 at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: ?nil), which is not related to the property rental business. Dividends Under the Irish REIT Regime, subject to having sufficient distributable reserves, I-RES is required to distribute to shareholders at least 85% of the Property Income of its Property Rental Business for each accounting period. On 8 August 2024, the Directors resolved to pay an additional dividend of ?10.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2024. The dividend of 1.88 cents per share was paid on 13 September 2024 to shareholders on record as at 23 August 2024. On 23 February 2024, the Directors resolved to pay an additional dividend of ?10.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2023. The dividend of 2.00 cents per share was paid on 28 March 2024 to shareholders on record as at 8 March 2024. On 2 August 2023, the Directors resolved to pay an additional dividend of ?12.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2023. The dividend of 2.45 cents per share was paid on 1 September 2023 to shareholders on record as at 11 August 2023. On 23 February 2023, the Directors resolved to pay an additional dividend of ?14.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2022. The dividend of 2.81 cents per share was paid on 3 April 2023 to shareholders on record as at 10 March 2023.

Transactions Transactions with Key Management Personnel For the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 24, the term ??key management personnel?? is defined as those persons having authority for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company. I-RES has determined that the key management personnel comprise the Board of Directors. See note 28 for further details on remuneration.  Owners? management companies not consolidated As a result of the acquisition by the Group of apartments or commercial space in certain residential rental properties, the Group holds voting rights in the relevant owners? management companies (?OMCs?) associated with those developments. Where the Group holds the majority of those voting rights, this entitles it, inter alia, to control the composition of such OMCs? boards of directors. However, as each of those OMCs is incorporated as a company limited by guarantee for the purpose of owning the common areas in residential or mixed-use developments, they are not intended to be traded for gains. I-RES does not consider these OMCs to be material for consolidation as the total assets of the OMCs is less than 1% of the Group?s total assets. The total service fees billed by OMCs for the year ended 31 December 2024 were ?9.5 million (2023 ?9.9 million). As at 31 December 2024, ?0.1 million was payable and ?1.0 million was prepaid by the Group to the OMCs. As at 31 December 2023, ?0.1 million was payable and ?1.0 million was prepaid by I-RES to the OMCs. Contingencies At Beacon South Quarter, in addition to the capital expenditure work that has already been completed, water ingress works were identified in 2016 and I-RES is working with the Beacon South Quarter owners? management company to resolve these matters. The amount of potential costs relating to these structural remediation works cannot be currently measured with sufficient reliability. Commitments As at 31 December 2024 there are no material commitments. Loss per Share (Loss)/Earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the reporting period attributable to ordinary shareholders of I-RES by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/><entry colname=\"col11\"/><entry colname=\"col12\"/><entry colname=\"col13\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_66\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"360\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the year ended</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31 December 2023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss attributable to shareholders of I-RES (?'000)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(6,676)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(116,014)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Basic weighted average number of shares</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">529,578,946</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">529,578,946</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Diluted weighted average number of shares(1)(2)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">529,578,946</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">529,578,946</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Basic Loss per share (cents)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(1.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(21.9)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Diluted Loss per share (cents)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(1.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(21.9)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0(1)\u00a0Diluted weighted average number of shares includes the additional shares resulting from dilution of the long-term incentive plan options as of the reporting period date. \u00a0(2)\u00a0At 31 December 2024, 4,596,499 options (31 December 2023: 4,596,499) were excluded from the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. \u00a0 EPRA issued Best Practices Recommendations most recently in October 2019, which gives guidelines for performance matters. EPRA Earnings represents the earnings from the core operational activities (recurring items for I-RES). It is intended to provide an indicator of the underlying performance of the property portfolio and therefore excludes all components not relevant to the underlying and recurring performance of the portfolio, including any revaluation results and results from the sale of properties.

The three EPRA NAV metrics are EPRA Net Reinstatement Value (?EPRA NRV??), EPRA Net Tangible Asset (?EPRA NTA?) and EPRA Net Disposal Value (?EPRA NDV?). Each EPRA NAV metric serves a different purpose. The EPRA NRV measure is to highlight the value of net assets on a long term basis. EPRA NTA assumes entities buy and sell assets, thereby crystallising certain levels of deferred tax liability. Lastly, EPRA NDV provides the reader with a scenario where deferred tax, financial instruments and certain other adjustments are calculated to the full extent of their liabilities. The table below presents the transition between the Group?s shareholders? equity derived from the consolidated financial statements and the various EPRA NAV.

For the purposes of EPRA NTA, the Group has assumed any such sales proceeds are reinvested within the required three-year window. \u00a0(2)\u00a0Deferred tax is assumed as per the IFRS statement of financial position. To the extent that an orderly sale of the Group?s assets was undertaken over a period of several years, during which time (i) the Group remained a REIT; (ii) no new assets were acquired or sales proceeds reinvested; (iii) any developments completed were held for three years from completion; and (iv) those assets were sold at 31 December 2024 valuations, the sales proceeds would need to be distributed to shareholders by way of dividend within the required time frame or else a tax liability amounting to up to 25% of distributable reserves plus current unrealised revaluation gains could arise for the Group. \u00a0(3)\u00a0This is the purchaser costs amount as provided in the valuation certificate. Purchasers? costs consist of items such as stamp duty on legal transfer and other purchase fees that may be incurred and which are deducted from the gross value in arriving at the fair value of investment for IFRS purposes. Purchasers? costs are in general estimated at 9.96% for commercial, 4.46% for residential apartment units and 12.46% for houses and duplexes.  \u00a0 Employee Costs and Auditor Remuneration \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_70\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"360\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the year ended</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31 December 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31 December 2023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?'000</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Employee costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Salaries, benefits and bonus</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">9,201</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8,562</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Social insurance costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">923</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">877</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Pension costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">224</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">197</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Share-based payments</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">305</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">153</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10,653</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">9,789</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 The average number of employees in the period was 98 (2023: 94).

Subsequent Events At the date of authorisation of the consolidated financial statements, there are no adjusting or non-adjusting events after the reporting period.\u00a0  Glossary of Terms The following explanations are not intended as technical definitions, but rather are intended to assist the reader in understanding terms used in this report. ?Adjusted Earnings (excluding fair value movements)?  Adjusted EPRA Earnings plus Gain/(Loss) on Disposal of investment property ?Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses? General and administrative expenses adjusted to remove non-recurring costs; ?Annualised Passing Rent? Defined as the actual monthly residential and commercial rents under contract with residents as at the stated date, multiplied by 12, to annualise the monthly rent; ? Assets Held For Sale (AHFS)? Investment properties being held for sale which are expected to be disposed on within the next 12 months. ?Average Monthly Rent (AMR)? Actual monthly residential rents, net of vacancies, as at the stated date, divided by the total number of apartments owned in the property; ?Basic Earnings per share (Basic EPS)? Calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the reporting period attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company in accordance with IFRS by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period; ?Companies Act, 2014? The Irish Companies Act, 2014; ?Diluted weighted average number of shares? Includes the additional shares resulting from dilution of the long-term incentive plan options as of the reporting period date; ?Adjusted EBITDA? Represents earnings before lease interest, financing costs, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, gain or loss on disposal of investment property, net movement in fair value of investment properties and gain or loss on derivative financial instruments and non-recurring costs to show the underlying operating performance of the Group; ?Adjusted EBITDA Margin? Calculated as Adjusted EBITDA over the revenue from investment properties; ?EPRA? The European Public Real Estate Association; ?EPRA Diluted EPS? Calculated by dividing EPRA Earnings for the reporting period attributable to shareholders of the Company by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period. EPRA Earnings measures the level of income arising from operational activities. It is intended to provide an indicator of the underlying income performance generated from leasing and management of the property portfolio, while taking into account dilutive effects and therefore excludes all components not relevant to the underlying net income performance of the portfolio, such as unrealised changes in valuation and any gains or losses on disposals of properties; \u00a0 ?EPRA Earnings? EPRA Earnings is the profit after tax excluding revaluations and gains and losses on disposals and associated taxation (if any); ?Adjusted EPRA Earnings? Represents EPRA Earnings adjusted for non-recurring costs to show the underlying EPRA Earnings of the Group; ?EPRA EPS? Calculated by dividing EPRA Earnings for the reporting period attributable to shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period. EPRA Earnings measures the level of income arising from operational activities. It is intended to provide an indicator of the underlying income performance generated from leasing and management of the property portfolio and therefore excludes all components not relevant to the underlying net income performance of the portfolio, such as unrealised changes in valuation and any gains or losses on disposals of properties; ?Adjusted EPRA EPS? EPRA EPS calculated using Adjusted EPRA Earnings; ?EPRA NAV? EPRA introduced three EPRA NAV metrics to replace the existing EPRA NAV calculation that was previously being presented. The three EPRA NAV metrics are EPRA Net Reinstatement Value (?EPRA NRV?), EPRA Net Tangible Asset (?EPRA NTA?) and EPRA Net Disposal Value (?EPRA NDV?). Each EPRA NAV metric serves a different purpose. The EPRA NRV measure is to highlight the value of net assets on a long-term basis. EPRA NTA assumes entities buy and sell assets, thereby crystallising certain levels of deferred tax liability. Any gains arising from the sale of a property are expected either to be reinvested for growth or 85% of the net proceeds are distributed to the shareholders to maintain the REIT status. Lastly, EPRA NDV provides the reader with a scenario where deferred tax, financial instruments and certain other adjustments are calculated to the full extent of their liabilities. ?EPRA NAV per share? Calculated by dividing each of the EPRA NAV metric by the diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding as at the end of the reporting period; ?Equivalent Yields (formerly referred as Capitalisation Rate)? The rate of return on a property investment based on current and projected future income streams that such property investment will generate. This is derived by the external valuers and is used to estimate the term and reversionary yields; ?Group Total Gearing or Net Loan to Value (Net LTV)? Calculated by dividing the Group?s aggregate borrowings (net of cash) by the fair value of the Group?s property portfolio, including assets held for sale; ?Loan to Value (LTV)? Calculated by dividing the Group?s aggregate borrowings by the fair value of the Group?s property portfolio; ?Gross Yield? Calculated as the Annualised Passing Rent as at the stated date, divided by the fair value of the investment properties, including units classified as assets held for sale and excluding fair value of development land as at the reporting date; ?Irish REIT Regime? Means the provisions of the Irish laws and regulations establishing and governing real estate investment trusts, in particular, but without limitation, section 705A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (as inserted by section 41(c) of the Finance Act, 2013), as amended from time to time; ?LEED? LEED stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. It is a rating system to certify sustainable buildings and neighbourhoods; ?Like for Like? Like-for-like amounts are presented as they measure operating performance adjusted to remove the impact of properties that were only owned for part of the relevant period or comparative period; ?Market Capitalisation? Calculated as the closing share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding; ?Net Asset Value? or ?NAV? Calculated as the value of the Group?s or Company?s assets less the value of its liabilities measured in accordance with IFRS; ?Net Asset Value per share? Calculated by dividing NAV by the basic number of ordinary shares outstanding as at the end of the reporting period; ?Net Rental Income (NRI)? Measured as property revenue less property operating expenses; ?Net Rental Income Margin? Calculated as the NRI over the revenue from investment properties; ?Occupancy Rate? Calculated as the total number of apartments occupied divided by the total number of apartments owned as at the reporting date available to rent;  ?Property Income? As defined in section 705A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. It means, in relation to a company or group, the Property Profits of the Company or Group, as the case may be, calculated using accounting principles, as: (a) reduced by the Property Net Gains of the Company or Group, as the case may be, where Property Net Gains arise, or (b) increased by the Property Net Losses of the Company or Group, as the case may be, where Property Net Losses arise; ?Property Profits? As defined in section 705A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997; ?Property Net Gains? As defined in section 705A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997; ?Property Net Losses? As defined in section 705A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997; ?Property Rental Business? As defined in section 705A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997; ?Sq. ft.? Square feet; ?Sq. m.? Square metres; ?Stabilised NRI? Measured as property revenue less property operating expenses adjusted for market-based assumptions such as long-term vacancy rates, management fees, repairs and maintenance; ?Total Property Value? Total investment property plus any property classified as assets held for sale ?Vacancy Costs? Defined as the value of the rent on unoccupied residential apartments and commercial units for the specified period.

They renewed this promise in 2009 when they committed to jointly mobilise $ 100 billion per year by 2020 to this end. At the 2015 climate summit in Paris, they agreed to extend that goal until 2025 and to set a new collective goal of at least $ 100 billion per year for the period after that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a previous contribution, we assessed to what extent rich countries meet their obligations. We concluded that they largely fail to do so. In this essay, we check what changed after the most recent UN climate summit in December 2023 in Dubai (COP28).</p><p>At COP28, new pledges were made to different climate funds that help poorer countries to take action on climate. First, at the opening of COP28, a fund covering loss and damage was formally established. Following suit, several countries announced pledges to the fund. France and Italy made the largest commitment ($ 108.9 million each), followed by Germany and the United Arab Emirates ($ 100 million each). In total, pledges so far have reached about $ 661 million.</p><p>UNFCCC members had decided to establish the Loss and Damage Fund at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2022. The aim was to compensate vulnerable countries for climate-induced harm which already occurred or no longer can be avoided, and which goes beyond what people can adapt to. </p><p>However, despite this decision, negotiations on how the fund would operate continued through 2023. Finally, stakeholders agreed that the fund will be administered by the World Bank, via a board of 26 directors representing both industrialised and developing countries. The fund should receive both public and private contributions.</p><p>Second, Dubai saw additional funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The GCF was created in 2010 to provide developing countries with funding for both mitigation and adaptation. The fund accepts contributions from UNFCCC countries, public, non-public and alternative sources, including countries not party to the UNFCCC and private foundations. A total of $ 9.3 billion were confirmed for the initial resource mobilisation from 2015 to 2018, while $ 9.9 billion were confirmed for the first replenishment period from 2019 to 2023.</p><p>The second GCF replenishment period is running from 2024 to 2027. Previous to COP28, countries had already pledged to deliver $ 9.3 billion during that period. In Dubai, an additional $ 3.5 billion were announced. If all contributions are confirmed, the GCF will receive at least $ 12.8 billion in the period.</p><p>Third, several countries made pledges to the three UNFCCC funds dedicated to adaptation. All funds were established in 2001. Concerning the Adaptation Fund, the countries pledged a total of $ 192 million. Germany promised the largest sum ($ 65.7 million). The Adaptation Fund is dedicated to providing financial resources for climate adaptation in countries which are not mentioned as advanced countries in \u00adUNFCCC Annex I - and especially the most climate-vulnerable ones.</p><p>The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) focus on adaptation in the areas of agriculture, water and nature-based solutions as well as early warning and climate information systems. In Dubai, pledges to the LDCF totalled $ 141.7 million, while those to the SCCF amounted to $ 32.5 million. Both funds are operated via the Global Environmental Facility. While the LDCF focuses on the urgent and immediate adaptation needs of least-developed countries, the SCCF supports all developing countries with a special focus on climate adaptation in small island states.</p><p>Keeping things in perspective</p><p>According to an OECD report, in 2021 the total climate finance provided amounted to $ 89.6 billion (OECD 2023). Based on preliminary data, OECD finds it likely that the $ 100 billion goal was met in 2022. Without a doubt, the pledges made in Dubai are an important step towards fulfilling the goal in the medium term.</p><p>However, the good news should be taken with a grain of salt for at least three reasons. First, $ 100 billion per year is only a small fraction of what is needed to fund adaptation and loss and damage in developing countries.</p><p>Second, the burden for the $ 100 billion/year goal continues to be unevenly distributed. The World Resources Institute (WRI), an independent think tank based in Washington D.C., assessed how much each developed country should contribute to the goal based on their GNI and population. According to the WRI, only very few countries contribute their fair share, and the pledges made in Dubai did not change that.</p><p>Third, some of the most important reasons why developed countries fail to keep their promises have not been successfully addressed in Dubai. For example, not complying with climate-finance pledges remains unsanctionable.</p><p>Growing geopolitical challenges</p><p>Meanwhile, geopolitical conflicts keep diverting attention and resources away from climate financing. Western countries have increased their military budget since Russia's attack on Ukraine. This money cannot be spent on other objectives, including climate action. The Gaza war is a major source of instability too. Hostilities have escalated since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, and there is a considerable risk of the war spreading across the Middle East. Animosities between the US and Iran are a sign of concern, as is the strategic competition between the US and China.</p><p>The outcome of the US presidential elections is likely to impact climate finance too. Under Donald Trump as president, the US withdrew from the Paris climate agreement in 2017. President Joe Biden returned his country to the agreement after entering office in 2021. Should Donald Trump win the election in November this year, American and international climate policy might suffer tremendously.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Germany promised the largest sum ($ 65. 7 million).

AFC, acting as mandated lead arranger for the commercial tranche, has committed to invest EUR85 million, combining with export credit agency financing from the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. and the U.S. Private Export Funding Corporation. Other key partners include Standard Chartered Bank as the coordinating and structuring bank; Conduril, a leading Portuguese civil engineering firm which is the main EPC contractor; and Acrow, a U.S. construction industry giant as the bridge supplier. The signing took place at this week's US-Africa Business Summit in Dallas, Texas, organised by the Corporate Council on Africa.  Initiated by the Ministry of Public Works, Urban Planning and Housing in Angola, the project specifically targets improved accessibility in remote areas and supports industrial and commercial activity, advancing prosperity by reducing transport costs and travel times, and easing poverty through job creation. Improving road interconnectivity particularly helps the agricultural sector produce and market much needed cereals for human food and animal feed, as well as livestock, providing a resolute response to increased food imports and fostering localisation of food chains.  \"AFC is proud to work with the government and other partners on this landmark project which is set to transform the country's road transportation infrastructure as Angola makes strides to diversify its economy away from oil,\" said AFC Board Member and Head of Financial Services, Sanjeev Gupta. \"This project not only supports the country's drive to make agriculture a foundation for economic growth, but it also prioritises the development of climate resilient infrastructure which contributes significantly to Angola's climate adaptation plan.\"  In October 2023, AFC was appointed lead project developer for the Lobito Corridor connecting northwest Zambia to the Benguela rail line in Angola and ultimately to the port of Lobito, working with the US government, the European Union, the African Development Bank and the governments of Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.

This would only be possible if the world's biggest polluters lead the charge, he stressed, referring to the G20 countries, which are responsible for 80% of global CO2 emissions.  Industrialized countries must draw up a \"clear and credible roadmap\" for phasing out coal and must double their funding for climate adaptation, Guterres said.   The UN head said developed countries must achieve net-zero targets by 2040, while emerging economies should achieve these by 2050.  Leaders from across the continent have gathered in the Kenyan capital to discuss the transition to green energy and lay out priorities for the COP28 global climate conference later this year.  A push to turbocharge the renewable energy sector and ways to increase financing for climate protection and adaptation efforts is occupying most of the meeting.  This is the first time a climate summit has been held with Africa and its roughly 1.3 billion inhabitants as its primary focus. The three-day summit, which runs until Wednesday, brings together African heads of state, UN representatives, as well as public and private sector representatives from across the globe.  Guterres called for a \"course correction\" in the global financial system to accelerate climate finance while supporting sustainable development.  The world needs an effective debt relief mechanism based on a comprehensive global financial system, Guterres said, which supports payment suspensions as well as lower interest rates and loan maturities.   According to Organization One, African countries are more indebted than ever before. Currently, 21 countries on the continent are either bankrupt or in danger of sliding into a debt crisis.  Moussa Faki, Chair of the African Union Commission, also called for fairer climate financing. The continent suffers the most from the climate crisis but contributes the least to emissions, he stressed.  According to UN estimates, climate adaptation in Africa will cost between $30 billion and $50 billion annually. African countries would not be able to raise even half of that, Faki said.  Climate finance must be made available, accessible and affordable, said Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, President of COP28, due to take place in Dubai from 30 November.   He called for a well-organized and just transition towards renewable energy sources.

Von der Leyen also underlined the importance of mobilizing private funding for the African economy to investment in the transition towards clean energy.   Through its Global Gateway initiative, the EU wants to mobilize around ?150 billion ($161 billion) for investments in Africa between 2021 and 2027.  African countries have contributed comparatively little to the climate crisis, but suffer disproportionately from its consequences.   The Horn of Africa is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years, while millions are also starving in the Sahel, which stretches from Senegal in the west to Djibouti in the east of the continent.

Countries agreed to support the transfer of emission reductions, incentivise the private sector and pursue non-market approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation. However, little was achieved at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, and things came to a standstill at COP28.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is particularly frustrating for Africa, where hopes were high in the run-up to COP28. Two months before the conference, the countries of the continent had agreed on a common position in the Africa Climate Summit Declaration, which proposed a 'global tax system including a carbon tax on fossil fuels, maritime transport and aviation'. Africa accounts for four percent of emissions but remains among the regions most affected by the climate crisis.</p><p>The global markets for carbon credits and offsets have suffered some serious reputational damage in the recent past. Broadly speaking, emission credits are permits for emissions authorised by a governing body to participants (e.g. companies or countries) in a regulated trading system with a cap. Emission offsets are created, for example, when a company invests in environmentally friendly projects to avoid emissions. These offsets can be traded on voluntary markets. </p><p>Despite criticism, revenues from carbon taxes and trading schemes totalled $ 95 billion last year, according to the World Bank. The Bank's recently published report 'State and Trends of Carbon Pricing for 2023: International Carbon Markets' shows that financial flows in the carbon markets have increased.</p><p>Research conducted by private-sector entities Trove Research and International Emissions Trading Association indicates that $ 17 billion were invested in carbon markets between 2020 and 2022. As of 2023, the global market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth almost $ 403 billion, according to a study by InsightAce Analytic, another firm. Africa has its eye on this money flow. It can help to close the huge gaps in its climate finance.</p><p>'Studies show that with $ 20 per tonne of nature-based carbon credits, $ 82 billion could be generated annually. That's about one and a half times the money Africa receives in official development assistance,' said Claver Gatete, executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, on the sidelines of COP28. According to Gatete, the UN agency is currently in talks with member states to ensure that Africa's partici\u00adpation in carbon markets is based on 'high integrity credits' which make sure the continent is able to unlock benefit-sharing policies, deployment of sustainable decarbonisation pathways and investments in nature-based solutions.</p><p>'Next major export'</p><p>In 2021, Gabon became the first African country to receive payments totalling $ 17 million from the Central African Forest Initiative to reduce emissions by protecting the rainforest in its Congo Basin.</p><p>This triggered a continental race for sovereign carbon-offset programmes. At COP27, Kenyan President William Ruto declared that his country's 'next major export' would be carbon credits. He said this as he joined other African heads of state to unveil the African Carbon Markets Initiative, which aims to unlock $ 6 billion in annual revenues by 2030 while creating 30 million green jobs in Africa and generating 300 million carbon credits.</p><p>A few weeks after COP27, Ruto launched an ambitious tree planting initiative that aims to plant 15 billion trees and restore about 5.1 million hectares of degraded and deforested land in Kenya by 2032, with the aim of obtaining carbon credits.</p><p>In 2023, the Kenyan leader hosted the first Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi and also positioned it as a platform for developing the continent into a hotspot for carbon credits. The summit ended with pledges for carbon credits worth $ 650 million under the African Carbon Markets Initiative.</p><p>The pledge was led by Middle Eastern conglomerates, notably the UAE Carbon Alliance and UAE's Blue Carbon Company, which signed multi-million-dollar land deals with several African governments to secure and manage forests, wetlands, peatlands, swamps and grasslands, as well as coastal mangrove forests. The governments' promise is to conserve these areas and generate carbon credits. In return, the conglomerates will sell the carbon credits to companies and governments that want to compensate for emissions and thus fulfil their climate pledges.</p><p>There are currently two types of carbon markets:</p><p>In compliance markets, governments set up and regulate an emissions trading system defined by a geographical area with an emissions cap. This is the case with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Under such a system, companies and countries that have exhausted their emission quotas can buy unused emission allowances from other companies to continue emitting beyond their quotas. They can also purchase 'offset credits' from other countries outside the geographical scope of the scheme.</p><p>In voluntary carbon markets, there is little or no regulation. Companies set their own emission targets and buy carbon credits from willing sellers to cover or offset their carbon emissions.</p><p>In Africa, it is mainly the voluntary market that is well established, as countries are slow to create a legal framework that enables a thriving compliance market. However, the voluntary market on the continent is controversial and has been criticised for being opaque, discriminatory, unfair and ineffective in terms of development and climate policy. The environment minister of Congo-Brazzaville, Arlette Soudan-\u00adNonault, described it as an 'unregulated Wild West'.</p><p>Kenya currently dominates the voluntary carbon market in Africa with projects such as a mangrove restoration initiative and the Northern Rangelands Trust's carbon projects, according to Kenya's special climate-change envoy Ali Mohamed.

Mittal argues that these markets have not led to a reduction in carbon emissions. 'Conflicts of interest, fraud and speculation plague these markets, while the expansion of carbon offset programmes and tree plantations leads to the expropriation of community lands to make profits for investors,' she said. 'The expansion of carbon markets does not benefit Africa, but perpetuates the status quo of resource exploitation, greenhouse-gas pollution and power imbalance.'</p><p>A coalition of civil societies led by Power Shift Africa and Climate Action Network International also published a damning report stating: 'Carbon markets benefit polluters, fossil-fuel companies and market brokers. They drive pollution beyond climate limits and are neo-colonial barriers to realising genuine African development pathways.'</p><p>If Africa's participation in the carbon markets is to truly benefit the continent, its people and its nature, the situation must develop differently.

In a joint declaration, the EU also promised Ukraine the delivery of additional power generators and mobile heating stations as Russia's war against Ukraine enters its second winter.  \"The European Union will continue to provide strong financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes,\" the declaration read.  EU leaders also backed a legislative proposal on the use of revenues from the management of Russian assets frozen in the bloc for the reconstruction of Ukraine, and on strengthening EU sanctions on Moscow.  The new pledges come amid concerns that the war between Israel and Hamas could divert attention from the war in Ukraine.  Additional EU aid worth billions of euros for Ukraine however remained caught up in a dispute over the bloc's long-term budget after the end of a two-day summit in Brussels.  The European Commission aims to support Kiev's economy with a total of ?50 billion ($52.7 billion) between 2024 and 2027.  Additionally, EU top diplomat Josep Borrell had proposed to provide up to ?20 billion for military support for the same period.  While most EU states are ready to support Ukraine for the long haul, some countries, like Hungary and Slovakia, have so far been reluctant to make new financing commitments for Kiev.  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban stressed again in Brussels that he is not ready to agree to new money for Ukraine.  \"We must show endurance on support for Ukraine because we have to ... fulfil promises that we have given before,\" Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said, urging fellow leaders to act.  European Council President Charles Michel said it will be \"an exercise of collective intelligence\" to get all 27 EU countries to agree by the end of the year, when the current aid programme runs out.  Concerns are rising in Brussels that Orban's persistent veto might not only be rooted in his warm ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but also fuelled by his own financial interests.  Last year the commission froze ?13 billion in EU funds for Budapest over the deterioration of the rule of law under Orban's government.  Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel on Friday accused Orban of trying to blackmail the EU, implying that Orban would not agree to financial support for Ukraine until Budapest itself receives a multi-billion payment from Brussels.  Getting up 27 EU member states to agree to new support for Kiev is made even more difficult by the fact that continued financial aid for Ukraine had been tied to a legislative proposal for a sweeping revision of the EU's long-term budget.  The commission had asked member states to contribute an additional ?66 billion to the common budget to the discontent of some national governments, which are dealing with stagnating economies and tightened budgets at home.  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday that existing money should be better used before more contributions are required from member states.  Next to Ukraine, leaders also discussed the contested reform of the joint debt and deficit rules for EU countries using the euro as a common currency.  The usually strict spending rules were suspended to allow national governments to counter the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's war against Ukraine.  EU countries however now have to decide in the coming months on how to return to budget discipline while taking multiple economic challenges into account such as dwindling competitiveness and the cost of climate adaptation.

They need to be empowered so they become more resilient. Better land tenure serves that purpose because it enables them to adapt to the changing climate in ways that suit their specific needs:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Secure tenure gives rural communities a long-term stake in the health of their land and thus creates incentives to invest in sustainable land-management practices. Land ownership also ensures they have resources for doing so.</p><p>Experience shows that rural communities with secure land tenure are indeed more likely to adopt practices that prevent soil erosion, promote agroforestry and conserve water resources. These measures serve resilience against climate change-induced disasters.</p><p>Land tenure enables communities to engage in efforts to conserve biodiversity. When communities have control over their land, they are more likely to establish protected areas, implement wildlife corridors and apply traditional ecological knowledge in ways that safeguard local biodiversity. Diverse ecosystems, in turn, are more resilient to climate disruptions.</p><p>Rural communities intimately understand the unique climate challenges they face. With secure land tenure, they will develop local adaptation strategies that suit their needs, including crop diversification, soil improvement and sustainable water management.</p><p>At the same time, secure land tenure serves climate-change mitigation too:</p><p>Trees take many years to grow, and rural families who know they will benefit from long-term investments are more likely to engage in afforestation and reforestation. Trees are carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide and mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions. To some extent, international funding is available for afforestation and reforestation. However, secure tenure rights are often a precondition for participating in projects related to REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).</p><p>Tenure security allows communities to invest in agroecology and organic farming. These environment-friendly methods reduce the need for chemical inputs, ultimately lowering carbon emissions from the agricultural sector.</p><p>People with land-tenure rights can participate in generation of solar and wind power. By diversifying sources of revenue and contributing to clean energy generation, these initiatives help to reduce the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Advocacy matters</p><p>The empowerment of local rural communities through secure land-tenure rights requires concerted efforts on multiple fronts. Too many rural people have no rights - or only rather shaky rights - to the land they depend on. Women in particular are often denied what they should be entitled to.</p><p>Advocacy plays a pivotal role in ensuring that policymakers recognise the intrinsic links between land tenure on the one hand and climate adaptation and mitigation on the other. Advocacy groups will obviously benefit from solid data and scientific evidence. It is important to highlight success stories. Such examples can inspire others and encourage policymakers to promote change. On the other hand, case studies and evidence documenting disasters can help to avoid repeating mistakes.</p><p>A positive example is the promotion of mangrove co-management approaches in Bangladesh. A key component was the allocation of clear tenure rights to local communities. Land tenure allows them to use and manage mangroves in ways that increase their resilience to flooding resulting from sea-level rise.</p><p>It is important to push for reforms and policy initiatives to enhance local people's land tenure. It also makes sense to promote collective land use planning, involving rural communities in climate action. Relevant policy measures include:</p><p>the legal recognition of customary land rights,</p><p>streamlined land-registration processes and</p><p>protection against land grabbing.</p><p>Collective action</p><p>Advocacy is more effective when diverse stakeholders collaborate. Civil-society organisations, community-based initiatives, research institutions and government agencies should cooperate on amplifying the message. So far, however, there is a lack of grassroots involvement. All too often, local voices are not heard. Community-based organisations must be empowered, not least because they are essential for reaching out to rural people and convincing them of new approaches.</p><p>The Global Forum on Agricultural Research and Innovation is a multi-stakeholder membership-based platform. To emphasise inclusiveness, it will soon change its acronym from GFAR to GFAiR. Its mission includes focusing on small farmers' empowerment. Among other things, it engages in what it calls Collective Actions. One of them is called 'Mainstreaming land rights of the rural poor in the climate discourse'. In this context, a diverse set of stakeholders is exploring common interests and identifying priorities for addressing the extreme vulnerability of landless or almost landless poor in regard to the fast growing risks of climate-induced disasters. Core objectives are to:</p><p>raise awareness for the relevance of land tenure,</p><p>promote the involvement of local communities,</p><p>ensure open access to relevant data and</p><p>share best practices.</p><p>This Collective Action is coordinated by ANGOC (the Asian NGO Coalition for Agrarian Reform and Rural Development).

The gist of his message? There is absolutely no excuse for failing to ensure consistent African representation in the world's key decision-making bodies.  \"It is time to overcome the reticence and deconstruct the narratives that persist in confining Africa to the margins of decision-making circles,\" said Sall, who also is the president of Senegal.  Sall's speech was about the need to give Africa permanent seats at the UN Security Council so, as he put it, \"Africa can finally be represented where decisions that affect 1.4 billion Africans are being taken.\"  But that was far from the first time he has called upon the global community to seek and consider African perspectives. From the beginning of his one-year term as the African Union's chairman last February, Sall said he wanted to see fair, equitable international partnerships that welcomed African contributions instead of dismissing African priorities.  \"Our continent cannot be a field which is the feast of others,\" Sall said during his inaugural speech.  He also has spoken up for greater African representation in the G20, which as of yet only has one African member (South Africa). Multilateralism must \"serve the interests of all,\" Sall argued in October, or it will suffer \"loss of legitimacy and authority.\"  I commend Chairman Sall for his tireless work, not only to insist that the global community listens to and respects African issues, but also to build awareness of just what those issues are.  He has put African needs and priorities - including infrastructure development, greater access to COVID-19 vaccinations, food security, and an end to energy poverty - in front of world leaders ranging from Chinese President Xi Jinping to U.S. President Joe Biden. He has done the same at global events, including the 2022 G20 summit and the COP27 climate conference.  Sall has been particularly outspoken about Africa's energy needs and the rights of African countries to continue extracting and capitalizing upon their oil and gas resources, even in the face of tremendous global pressure for Africa to make a rapid switch to renewable energy sources. Sall has firmly stated that, when it comes to the global march toward net zero emissions, Africa will not be in lockstep with the rest of the world at the expense of our countries' well-being.  We are in an era when Africa needs fierce advocates. Nations and international partnerships are fighting for their respective priorities, and unless African leaders are willing to stand up for what our continent needs, our objectives will be pushed aside. Sall has, indeed, taken a stand.  We will not accept that polluting countries, responsible for the situation of the planet, tell us that we are no longer going to finance fossil fuels  An Unwavering Voice for a Just Energy Transition  African energy was not Sall's only priority as chairman of the African Union, but he did, rightfully, use his platform to expand global awareness of Africa's unique energy needs in 2022. He pointed out the hypocrisy of wealthy countries that harnessed fossil fuels to industrialize and grow their economies telling developing African countries that the world's zero-emission goals trumped their right to do the same.  \"We will not accept that polluting countries, responsible for the situation of the planet, tell us that we are no longer going to finance fossil fuels,\" Sall said in September.  He made similar remarks when he opened the MSGBC Oil, Gas &amp; Power 2022 conference and exhibition, held Sept. 1-2 this year in Dakar. The MSGBC region comprises Mauritania, Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea-Conakry.  \"In this new configuration of the world, energy resources are major assets for Africa. Therefore, we must not accept that our continent is an object of world geopolitics, but an actor, aware of its natural wealth of interests, which acts on the competition instead of suffering it,\" Sall said, adding that made no sense for African countries to stop exploiting their oil and gas resources while more than 600 million Africans lacked electricity. \"While remaining committed to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement, we must continue to defend the interests of our countries in the run-up to COP27 next November in Egypt.\"  And that's exactly what happened. Sall and other African leaders fiercely defended Africa's energy interests before and during COP27. The result? As multiple news outlets reported, African natural gas took center stage at the conference.  A Strong Collaborator  As I tweeted in November, Africa was fortunate to have Sall at COP27. He understands both sides of the African energy transition debate: the need for Africa to set the timing for its shift to renewables and the world's need to address climate change. Sall advocated for ongoing natural gas production in Africa, which allows us to minimize carbon dioxide emissions while providing much-needed gas to generate electricity domestically, build our economies, and move toward industrialization. Sall also has pushed for the international community to help fund the renewable energy infrastructure Africa needs for a just transition and to provide financial support for African climate adaptation.  Climate adaptation measures have particularly been a priority for Sall. In his capacity as president of Senegal, he and the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), Patrick Verkooijen, partnered in 2022 to unlock $1 billion in climate finance for Senegal under the Africa Adaptation Accelerator Program (AAAP). The AAAP, Africa-led and Africa-owned, is working to bolster adaptation in agriculture, digital services, infrastructure, entrepreneurship, and jobs for young people. It was developed by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) in collaboration with the African Union.  Sall was among the trailblazers to convene the Africa Adaptation Leaders' Event during COP27. He also co-wrote, with French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, an opinion piece for the Guardian about the AAAP. It emphasized the critical importance of increased funding from developed countries for climate adaptation initiatives in developing countries, particularly those in Africa.  What we've seen is a pragmatic approach from Sall, one that recognizes the need for Africa to continue harnessing its oil and gas reserves while working diligently to move toward the transition to renewables - and to build climate resiliency into Africa's economy.  When Sall's one-year term at the helm of the African Union concludes February 5, the many challenges facing Africa will hardly be behind us. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that Sall has been making a vital difference in his role. Sall has said, loudly and clearly, that African voices will not be silenced. Thanks to Sall, it appears that the global community is starting to hear that message. That is a step in the right direction.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Thanks to Sall, it appears that the global community is starting to hear that message. That is a step in the right direction. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

At a series of events across COP28, Tony Elumelu delivered a single message to world leaders:\u00a0 Africa needs to be heard, Africa?s future is the world?s future and the continent that is most impacted by and the least contributor to climate change, needs our attention.\u00a0 With African youth set to make up one third of global population later this century, the future of Africa?s youth, entrepreneurial, ambitious, resilient, needs to be given the highest priority. Elumelu offered the infrastructure and experience of his own Foundation?s 10 year $100m entrepreneurship programme to partners, to catalyse a further generation of African entrepreneurs; entrepreneurs who can address climate change and drive the broader wealth creation that Africa requires.\u00a0 Reaching and funding young entrepreneurs in every African country, the Elumelu approach of sector agnostic seed funding, mentoring, and networking has delivered robust impact. The annual COP UN Climate Change Conferences unites the world to assess progress in combatting climate change.\u00a0 Elumelu is one of Africa?s leading advocates for an equitable agenda for climate action and through the Tony Elumelu Foundation has empowered thousands of green entrepreneurs, shaping a more sustainable future for Africa. The Tony Elumelu Foundation, in partnership with the United Bank for Africa (UBA), hosted a high-level session, bringing together Africans, and key players in the Gulf, Europe, and Americas, where UBA operates, underscoring the urgent need for innovative approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation, while fostering sustainable development, and bringing attention to Africa?s unique position. Speakers included Dr. Okonjo Iweala, Director General, World Trade Organization; Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP, Kevin Frey, CEO, UNICEF Generation Unlimited; Sergio Pimenta, VP Africa, IFC; Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative, World Bank; Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate; Joseph Nganga, Vice President, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, Rockefeller Foundation; Hassan Al Hashemi, VP International Relations, Dubai Chambers; Serge Eku\u00e9, Chairman, West African Development Bank (BOAD); Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy Group Managing Director, United Bank for Africa; and Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of Delegation, UNFCCC. ?Addressing climate change is the paramount challenge of our era.\u00a0 The urgency is unmistakable.?\u00a0 Elumelu stated. \u00a0?It is critical that Africa, as a continent, and African voices, play a key role in global climate conversations, as meaningful participants, and no longer as bystanders.\u00a0 Africa is least responsible and is disproportionately impacted by climate change.\u00a0 I am investing in a generation of green entrepreneurs, and we are extending the hand of partnership, so that others can benefit and use the infrastructure and platform we have created to reach entrepreneurs across Africa.? Elumelu represented the African private sector at the 2023 New Global Financing Pact in Paris at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, and the Climate Finance Mobilisation Forum in London, at the invitation of King Charles III of the United Kingdom and U.S. President Biden.\u00a0 At the 78th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA78) in New York, the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) launched a first-of-its-kind Green Entrepreneurship Programme, the #BeGreenAfrica Initiative, in partnership with the IKEA Foundation, Dutch Government and UNICEF GenU, to support green entrepreneurship and youth development. Tony Elumelu Entrepreneur from Madagascar in the green economy, Marie-Christiana Kola, shared a compelling impact story.\u00a0 ?As a beneficiary of the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship programme, I was able to create a recycled and 100% biodegradable hand soap made with waste cooked oil - the number one water polluter of water in African urban cities.\u00a0 These soaps do not only protect the environment, but they are also solidarity soaps.\u00a0 I was also able to attend the COP27 conference in Egypt, where I won the Innovation Prize.\u00a0 Today, I have employed over 30 people because of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.? Speaking at the TEF #COP28 high-level event, Dr. Okonjo Iweala, DG, World Trade Organisation stated, ?I am proud of what my brother, Tony Elumelu, has done in empowering and inspiring so many young entrepreneurs.\u00a0 We have no choice; the future is green.\u00a0 The future of growth is two things ? it is green, and it must be inclusive. I am very interested in partnerships with organisations like TEF.? Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP added, ?The reason why UNDP associated itself with the Tony Elumelu Foundation years ago is because of the leadership and courage of the Foundation to trust and invest in young Africans.\u00a0 It was one of the first organisation to do so at that scale.? The Foundation partnered with the UNDP to empower thousands in the Sahel, with an ambitious project to impact the lives one million young Africans. Sergio Pimenta, VP, Africa at the IFC, also stated, ?Tony, I salute you and your Foundation for what you have been doing to support young entrepreneurs in Africa. The IFC has deployed $2billion in funding for African SMEs in the last fiscal year and we are very excited to be able to do more, working with you.? Kevin Frey, CEO UNICEF Generation Unlimited added, ?With TEF, we have moved in a concerted way into the entrepreneurial space. Generation Unlimited now have a flagship programme with the Tony Elumelu Foundation called #BeGreenAfrica, launched in Kenya, and now with the support of the IKEA Foundation and the Dutch Government, we have scaled to Nigeria, Morocco, South Africa, and Senegal. We will train and seed 500 green entrepreneurs this year in the pilot project across those countries.\u00a0 So Tony, thank you so much, you are right it is all about partnerships.? Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative at the World Bank, announced, ?Our women-focused initiative has been able to secure $3.6 billion to finance women entrepreneurs in 67 countries across the world, and is set to launch a new programme focused on financing African women entrepreneurs to drive the continent?s green energy transition, and we are keen to work with the Tony Elumelu Foundation.? Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of UNFCCC Delegation stated, ?My Government and I commend the Tony Elumelu Foundation?s incredible impact across Africa, and will facilitate connections between the Tony Elumelu Foundation, and the Swedish embassies across Africa to drive innovation, digitalisation, and green-energy transition, which promises to bring about new jobs and growth.? Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate, added? Before coming to the United States Treasury, I was working in venture capital, and I know first-hand that it is incredibly important what the Tony Elumelu Foundation is doing. I have seen two pillars of their work ? financing and the mentorship ? just as I have seen with Silicon Valley, which helps to drive innovation and jobs creation. We are excited to begin partnership conversations.? Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy GMD, United Bank for Africa, announced, ?For us, UBA, we give market access into 20 geographies in Africa.\u00a0 Everything that we do is around Africa, and that is why we have partnered with the Afrexim Bank to launch the $6billion fund for SMEs with a focus on import substitution, working in four key areas including climate emission reduction.? Earlier in the day, Tony Elumelu joined Ajay Banga, President of World Bank Group; Brian Moynihan, Chair of the Board and CEO of Bank of America; Ms. Ruth Porat, President, Alphabet and Google; and Ms. Laurene Powell Jobs, Founder &amp; President of Emerson Collective as a panelist in a session titled ?Big, Audacious and Green: A Convergence of Visionaries?, moderated by B\u00f8rge Brende, President of World Economic Forum.

However, their communities often remain overlooked and chronically underfunded, especially in the rural areas of low- and lower middle-income countries (LICs and LMICs) where poverty and hunger are most entrenched. These areas have been side-lined for decades and are home to 80 % of the world's poorest. Making just six cents for every dollar worth of food they produce, many see no other option but to migrate in pursuit of better opportunities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Felipe Nazar, a farmer from the Philippines, puts it straight in an interview with The New Humanitarian: 'We don't earn anything during harvests. We just survive. We're practically giving away our crops.' To make matters worse, these communities are also the most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Investing in rural communities can alleviate poverty and fight hunger effectively. However, international assistance still falls short of addressing the increasing demands. According to OECD data, only $ 9.4 billion was allocated for agriculture, forestry and fishing in 2021, representing only four percent of the global official development assistance (ODA), the flow of financial resources from developed to developing countries to finance their socioeconomic development. The lack of adequate funding hampers the transformative potential of rural communities to end hunger and poverty by 2030, as demanded by the UN's 2nd Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2). But there is hope.</p><p>How IFAD works</p><p>The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a UN specialised agency and international financial institution, works to eliminate poverty and hunger in rural areas of developing countries by investing in rural people. IFAD provides low-interest and highly concessional loans and grants through effective financial strategies. The UN Fund has 177 member states and was established in the 1970s in response to an energy and food crisis akin to what we are witnessing today. Since then, IFAD has been channelling investments to rural communities to boost food security, nutrition and incomes. Currently, IFAD is undergoing its triennial consultation to replenish the fund and agree on priorities for the future.</p><p>IFAD aims to assemble and catalyse finance going to rural areas, including cooperating with the private sector for this purpose. Measures include pooling resources, derisking operations and providing expert support to address intertwined topics like food security, migration, climate adaptation, private sector engagement and gender equality. Investing in long-term rural development through organisations like IFAD reduces emergency costs and promotes sustainable growth. Every dollar spent on resilience can save up to $ 10 in emergency aid. According to its own data, IFAD transforms every unit of investment into six-fold returns.</p><p>IFAD partners with governments for customised solutions. In Malawi, for example, a project improved market access for small-scale farmers and brought about multiple value-chains benefits through sustainable agricultural practices, intensified production and natural resource management. IFAD also strengthened local institutions and participated in policy dialogues to promote market-led agricultural growth and consistent policy implementation.</p><p>Beyond funding, IFAD ensures access to knowledge and decision-making processes, notably for women, youth and persons with disabilities. For example, the UN Fund features the so-called household methodologies (HHMs) approach which aims to support family members in working together to achieve a fairer workload. This targets patterns of gender inequality, thereby increasing agricultural productivity, improving nutrition and fostering overall social development.</p><p>IFAD also provides cushion to imminent crises. For example, it responded to the Covid-19 pandemic through the Rural Poor Stimulus Facility, a multi-donor initiative to ensure rural small-scale farmers had timely access to inputs, information, markets and finance. Moreover, IFAD tackled the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine with its Crisis Response Initiative which supported rural communities' resilience and capacity to mitigate the impact of shocks. This includes access to seeds, fuel and fertiliser as well as investing in small-scale infrastructure to improve productive capacity and reduce post-harvest losses.</p><p>IFAD is not just a fund; it is a strategic partner for sustainable development. One of IFAD's main concerns is finding the right balance between immediate aid and long-term investment. It is high time we invest to combat the root causes of hunger and poverty, rather than simply reacting to recurrent crises.</p><p>Agricultural solutions and private-sector engagement</p><p>One example of IFAD's approach is the Rural Adelante (RA) initiative in El Salvador: it developed rural areas and agriculture, providing opportunities for women and youth - and alternatives to migration - while adapting to new climatic patterns. For instance, it doubled production and allowed year-round cultivation by introducing hydroponics, where plants are grown without soil and nourished with a nutrient-rich solution. As one female farmer participating in RA puts it: 'With hydroponics, we have a great advantage; we better control pests, plant quality seeds and use qualified varieties.'</p><p>The initiative encouraged young rural populations' participation in value chains through financial support while recognising the unique challenges faced by women, who make up 40 % of its active participants. The project also targeted traditionally excluded and vulnerable groups like indigenous peoples, children and the elderly. Beyond the main activities, the project conducted applied policy-research.</p><p>IFAD strongly advocates for financial inclusion using digital technologies, value-chain financing, credit cooperatives, and public-private partnerships (PPPs). In rural development, PPPs link small scale farmers, as private operators, to the wider market. Climate change is unpredictable to a certain degree, which makes it necessary for these farmers to have access to resources and technology. IFAD's strategy goes beyond derisking and regulatory reforms and emphasises private sector engagement, aligning private investments with the SDGs, the Paris Agreement and a vision for a sustainable global food system.</p><p>IFAD is pioneering a financial framework promoting collaboration and partnerships, leading food-systems financing with the World Bank and the UN Food Systems Coordination Hub. Events in 2023, like the SDG Summit and COP28, amplify these efforts. Food-system transformation pillars - coordination, finance, governance and innovation - must be prioritised as elements of a critical pathway to achieve the SDGs. IFAD's current replenishment offers a blueprint for addressing these challenges and boosting financial commitment to rural food system transformation.</p><p>PPP in Mali</p><p>One of these PPPs is the partnership with Mali Biocarburant SA (MBSA), which manufactures eco-friendly biodiesel using the energy plant jatropha. MBSA supports farmers in leveraging carbon credits. Farmers cultivate jatropha, and their cooperatives sell the nuts to MBSA for oil extraction. IFAD supports these partnerships via joint ventures and contract farming. Smallholder farmers partake in pricing and other decisions and, as shareholders, gain from share appreciation and dividends.</p><p>Additionally, intercropping with jatropha enhances food crop yields, providing a financial safety net. The broader community also benefits, notably from jatropha's role in land rehabilitation. The extraction's residue enriches soil and is used in soap production, empowering women through soap factory ownership.</p><p>Raising additional funds</p><p>In order to respond to increased needs due to the war in Ukraine, the aftermaths of slow Covid-19 recovery and the energy crisis, IFAD is making a concerted effort to raise more funds to serve rural people. Scaled up support of donor countries is vital, as is finding new ways to bring in new financing. In addition to its current replenishment process with member states, IFAD is raising an additional $ 500 million through private placements. The money will be used for proactive measures to tackle climate displacement, social instability and gender inequality.</p><p>Germany is one of the countries boosting IFAD's engagement with the private sector and endorsing sustainable financial strategies. KfW, a pioneer lender for IFAD since 2014, recently extended a pound  400 million promotional loan for IFAD's $ 3.5 billion programme in 2022-2024.</p><p>Rural development transcends the boundaries of rural areas - its implications ripple through global issues like migration, women's empowerment, climate change and food security. Therefore, supporting IFAD is about addressing immediate challenges for humanity, as well as investing in medium to long-term solutions. By doing so, global commitment to the most vulnerable people in the world can be reaffirmed.</p><p>Germany's support has been instrumental in driving positive change in rural communities worldwide. We hope it will continue standing with IFAD, championing the cause of those who feed the world and ensuring a resilient future for the generations to come.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Currently, IFAD is undergoing its triennial consultation to replenish the fund and agree on priorities for the future.

All issues must be addressed head on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Food security' is defined as access to sufficient quantities of food in appropriate quality. It obviously depends on an adequate and affordable supply of all ingredients required for a nutritious diet. Today, about 735 million people around the world do not get sufficient food and are undernourished as a result. About 3 billion, moreover, do not consume healthy diets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unless comprehensive action is taken, the climate crisis will make matters worse. A holistic agri-food system perspective must consider the entire range of actors involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products. It must also take account of agriculture (including livestock), forestry, fisheries and food industries, as well as the broader economy, social disparities and the natural environment.</p><p>A sustainable food system must achieve good nutrition for all in a way that preserves the foundations of future generations' food security. This challenge has economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions. It is crucial to preventing further loss of biodiversity and to stabilising the climate.</p><p>Mitigation, adaptation, transformation</p><p>Many national food systems, as well as the global food system, are losing resilience. 'Resilience' is the capability to cope with shocks without significant loss of livelihood, health and nutrition. Food-system resilience can be understood as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure to climate risks. It is therefore essential to limit the climate-related hazards that affect food supply, reduce food systems' vulnerability and lower people's exposure to risks. Three policy approaches serve this triple purpose:</p><p>Mitigation of climate change. Radically reducing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is indispensable for sustainable food security. Global heating is leading to extreme weather events, which affect production as well as farm workers' health. Moreover, recent science suggests that extreme heat curtails photosynthesis, with serious impacts on crops and forests. And this is not just a terrestrial agenda, because climate change affects oceans, which also have a bearing on food systems. Nature-based solutions such as agroforestry, coupled with sustainable land and soil management, serve mitigation. However, mitigation in itself is no longer enough to safeguard food security.</p><p>Adaptation to climate change. People can protect themselves by increasing their chances to cope. Important issues include affordable access to clean energy, water and healthcare. All of them have a bearing on good nutrition. Long-term adaptation, however, will be impossible unless mitigation puts an end to further heating.</p><p>Transformation. Socio-ecological systems, including the lifestyles of wealthy nations, must change to become sustainable. In particular, people in high-income countries must reduce their consumption and assume responsibility for their impact on the environment.</p><p>The climate crisis negatively affects food security in several ways. For example, access to safe drinking water is becoming more precarious. Climate events like floods often disrupt it. Diarrhoeal diseases, however, affect humans' intake of micronutrients. These illnesses have a strong correlation with rising temperatures. At the same time, heat waves make it more difficult to handle food safely.</p><p>The climate crisis also affects market dynamics and causes price volatility. Price hikes are happening more frequently. Several issues can exacerbate the impacts of weather-related shortfalls in food production. They include poor market transparency, financial speculation in commodity markets as well as export restrictions. The current grain-market disruptions resulting from Russia's attack on Ukraine show how important unrestricted exports are.</p><p>Crucial policy areas</p><p>Policymakers' action must not only boost food systems' resilience against known risks around the world, but also increase resilience to so-far unknown ones. Cross-cutting action is necessary. In particular, progress is needed in seven policy areas:</p><p>Sustainable land management (SLM): Relevant aspects include sustainable water management, ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, climate adaptation and mitigation as well as the protection of biodiversity. SLM incentives (such as payments for ecosystem services) are necessary. Crop cultivation and livestock production must be practiced in economically viable and environmentally sustainable ways. Social protection. Poverty often undermines families' food security. Nutrition interventions like school meal programmes are helpful. So are cash-transfer schemes or job creation. Countries with low and middle incomes deserve support for improving social protection. Access to healthcare and education are essential. Where related polices are not in place, they should be adopted. Food security hinges on the reduction of inequality. Diversification. Diversifying agriculture and supply chains strengthens food-system resilience. However, diversification has costs as it reduces opportunities for economies of scale and specialisation. Transaction costs tend to rise accordingly. Another challenge is that resilience is not just about withstanding current shocks, but also about maintaining the capacity for future development. If diversification hampers the latter, it is not fully conducive to resilience building.</p><p>International trade. Ensuring free and open global food trade will require a reinvigoration of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Panic-induced border closures lead to international price spikes. Transparent information on production, stocks and government interventions around the world is critical and must be made publicly available (e.g., through the Agricultural Market Information System - AMIS). Trade facilitation in terms of investments in infrastructure - including particularly the digitisation of customs systems - matters too.</p><p>Insurance is a promising tool to strengthen food-system resilience. It spreads both the risks and the costs of negative shocks among a large pool of people, enhancing resilience at the level of individuals. However, it does not prevent or reduce climate risks. Insurance may thus prove counterproductive if it motivates people to continue unsustainable activities. Though this kind of financial service is quite effective in terms of managing individual shocks, it is less useful when many people experience shock impacts at once, as is typically the case in extreme weather events. Migration. In response to the climate crisis, people are leaving their homes. In some cases, migration is basically a form of livelihood diversification. Remittances from migrant workers contribute to their families' resilience after all. However, entire areas are likely to become uninhabitable, for example, as the rising sea level inundates islands. Migration processes and policies need to be coordinated, and both sending and receiving countries must act in ways that make migration strengthen the resilience of individuals and systems. Climate refugees from countries that are becoming uninhabitable must get an internationally recognised climate refugee passport.</p><p>Science-based innovation. Science is facilitating key innovations in food systems, including efforts to reduce risks and to enhance productivity. Bioscience and digital technology are important. Scientific research also helps to find new ways to maintain and, if necessary, renew productive soils, water resources and even entire landscapes. Science is also needed to protect biodiversity, including agricultural genetic diversity. Research can help to reduce inequality too. More funding is needed for research on food systems.</p><p>We live in the Anthropocene, the age in which humanity is shaping the Earth's geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere. Action to enhance food security must be embedded in a broad strategic agenda of transformation. The global community must shift to a sustainable bioeconomy. It also needs a coherent governance structure to safeguard both food security and the global environment. The SDGs provide the concept, but not the policy framework for such joint action.</p><p>Long-term food security is intricately linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biodiversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Sustainable Development Goals. So far, appropriate funding has not been made available for any of the above-mentioned global agreements. That must change for the sake of humanity's common future.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Crucial policy areasPolicymakers' action must not only boost food systems' resilience against known risks around the world, but also increase resilience to so-far unknown ones.

At a series of events across COP28, Tony Elumelu delivered a single message to world leaders: Africa needs to be heard, Africa's future is the world's future and the continent that is most impacted by and the least contributor to climate change, needs our attention. With African youth set to make up one third of global population later this century, the future of Africa's youth, entrepreneurial, ambitious, resilient, needs to be given the highest priority.  Elumelu offered the infrastructure and experience of his own Foundation's 10 year $100m entrepreneurship programme to partners, to catalyse a further generation of African entrepreneurs; entrepreneurs who can address climate change and drive the broader wealth creation that Africa requires. Reaching and funding young entrepreneurs in every African country, the Elumelu approach of sector agnostic seed funding, mentoring, and networking has delivered robust impact.  The annual COP UN Climate Change Conferences unites the world to assess progress in combatting climate change. Elumelu is one of Africa's leading advocates for an equitable agenda for climate action and through the Tony Elumelu Foundation has empowered thousands of green entrepreneurs, shaping a more sustainable future for Africa.  The Tony Elumelu Foundation, in partnership with the United Bank for Africa (UBA), hosted a high-level session, bringing together Africans, and key players in the Gulf, Europe, and Americas, where UBA operates, underscoring the urgent need for innovative approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation, while fostering sustainable development, and bringing attention to Africa's unique position.  Speakers included Dr. Okonjo Iweala, Director General, World Trade Organization; Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP, Kevin Frey, CEO, UNICEF Generation Unlimited; Sergio Pimenta, VP Africa, IFC; Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative, World Bank; Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate; Joseph Nganga, Vice President, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, Rockefeller Foundation; Hassan Al Hashemi, VP International Relations, Dubai Chambers; Serge Eku\\xE9, Chairman, West African Development Bank (BOAD); Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy Group Managing Director, United Bank for Africa; and Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of Delegation, UNFCCC.  \"Addressing climate change is the paramount challenge of our era. The urgency is unmistakable.\" Elumelu stated. \"It is critical that Africa, as a continent, and African voices, play a key role in global climate conversations, as meaningful participants, and no longer as bystanders. Africa is least responsible and is disproportionately impacted by climate change. I am investing in a generation of green entrepreneurs, and we are extending the hand of partnership, so that others can benefit and use the infrastructure and platform we have created to reach entrepreneurs across Africa.\"  Elumelu represented the African private sector at the 2023 New Global Financing Pact in Paris at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, and the Climate Finance Mobilisation Forum in London, at the invitation of King Charles III of the United Kingdom and U.S. President Biden. At the 78th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA78) in New York, the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) launched a first-of-its-kind Green Entrepreneurship Programme, the #BeGreenAfrica Initiative, in partnership with the IKEA Foundation, Dutch Government and UNICEF GenU, to support green entrepreneurship and youth development.  Tony Elumelu Entrepreneur from Madagascar in the green economy, Marie-Christiana Kola, shared a compelling impact story. \"As a beneficiary of the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship programme, I was able to create a recycled and 100% biodegradable hand soap made with waste cooked oil - the number one water polluter of water in African urban cities. These soaps do not only protect the environment, but they are also solidarity soaps. I was also able to attend the COP27 conference in Egypt, where I won the Innovation Prize. Today, I have employed over 30 people because of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.\"  Speaking at the TEF #COP28 high-level event, Dr. Okonjo Iweala, DG, World Trade Organisation stated, \"I am proud of what my brother, Tony Elumelu, has done in empowering and inspiring so many young entrepreneurs. We have no choice; the future is green. The future of growth is two things - it is green, and it must be inclusive. I am very interested in partnerships with organisations like TEF.\"  Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP added, \"The reason why UNDP associated itself with the Tony Elumelu Foundation years ago is because of the leadership and courage of the Foundation to trust and invest in young Africans. It was one of the first organisation to do so at that scale.\"  The Foundation partnered with the UNDP to empower thousands in the Sahel, with an ambitious project to impact the lives one million young Africans.  Sergio Pimenta, VP, Africa at the IFC, also stated, \"Tony, I salute you and your Foundation for what you have been doing to support young entrepreneurs in Africa. The IFC has deployed $2billion in funding for African SMEs in the last fiscal year and we are very excited to be able to do more, working with you.\"  Kevin Frey, CEO UNICEF Generation Unlimited added, \"With TEF, we have moved in a concerted way into the entrepreneurial space. Generation Unlimited now have a flagship programme with the Tony Elumelu Foundation called #BeGreenAfrica, launched in Kenya, and now with the support of the IKEA Foundation and the Dutch Government, we have scaled to Nigeria, Morocco, South Africa, and Senegal. We will train and seed 500 green entrepreneurs this year in the pilot project across those countries. So Tony, thank you so much, you are right it is all about partnerships.\"  Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative at the World Bank, announced, \"Our women-focused initiative has been able to secure $3.6 billion to finance women entrepreneurs in 67 countries across the world, and is set to launch a new programme focused on financing African women entrepreneurs to drive the continent's green energy transition, and we are keen to work with the Tony Elumelu Foundation.\"  Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of UNFCCC Delegation stated, \"My Government and I commend the Tony Elumelu Foundation's incredible impact across Africa, and will facilitate connections between the Tony Elumelu Foundation, and the Swedish embassies across Africa to drive innovation, digitalisation, and green-energy transition, which promises to bring about new jobs and growth.\"  Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate, added\" Before coming to the United States Treasury, I was working in venture capital, and I know first-hand that it is incredibly important what the Tony Elumelu Foundation is doing. I have seen two pillars of their work - financing and the mentorship - just as I have seen with Silicon Valley, which helps to drive innovation and jobs creation. We are excited to begin partnership conversations.\"  Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy GMD, United Bank for Africa, announced, \"For us, UBA, we give market access into 20 geographies in Africa. Everything that we do is around Africa, and that is why we have partnered with the Afrexim Bank to launch the $6billion fund for SMEs with a focus on import substitution, working in four key areas including climate emission reduction.\"  Earlier in the day, Tony Elumelu joined Ajay Banga, President of World Bank Group; Brian Moynihan, Chair of the Board and CEO of Bank of America; Ms. Ruth Porat, President, Alphabet and Google; and Ms. Laurene Powell Jobs, Founder &amp; President of Emerson Collective as a panelist in a session titled \"Big, Audacious and Green: A Convergence of Visionaries\", moderated by B\\xF8rge Brende, President of World Economic Forum.  On Sunday December 3 Mr. Tony Elumelu, also participated in a fireside conversation with Ms. Teresa Ribera, Vice President of the Government of Spain and Minister for Ecological Transition and Demographic Change, moderated by Sec. Hillary Rodham Clinton, and with closing remarks from Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The Tony Elumelu Foundation.

Thirty years later, it is still in question whether and to what extent related promises are being fulfilled. Climate-related finance is a broad term. Generally speaking, it means funding (either public or private) for reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions or adapting to the impacts of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given that governments only have indirect discretion over private finance flows, we will focus on public finance in this essay. Public climate finance follows different avenues:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It can be delivered through mechanisms established alongside the climate regime, such as the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), which then allocate funding to climate-related activities.</p><p>Money can also be allocated via other multilateral institutions, especially multilateral development banks, which then fund efforts in developing countries.</p><p>Finally, it can be delivered bilaterally, according to agreements between high-\u00adincome and developing countries.</p><p>Tackling global environmental challenges</p><p>Climate finance is thus directly related to climate-change mitigation, climate adaptation or both. However, it may also target broader objectives, for example, nature-based solutions for infrastructure purposes in line with the objectives of the three so-called Rio conventions. Apart from the \u00adUNFCCC, the UN Convention on Biodiversity and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification were on the agenda of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Global environmental objectives include:</p><p>limiting global warming to less than 2?oC compared to pre-industrial levels,</p><p>halting further loss of biodiversity,</p><p>protecting land and marine ecosystems and</p><p>stopping land degradation.</p><p>Biodiversity finance aims specifically to stop or reverse nature loss in order to protect human health and prosperity. Progress on this front was recently made at the 2022 UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming-Montr\u00e9al. For example, the summit foresaw an annual $?20 billion of biodiversity funding from 2025, rising to $?30 billion from 2030.</p><p>The climate summit in Sharm el Sheikh in 2022, moreover, decided to establish another form of climate finance. Loss and damage funding is supposed to compensate vulnerable countries for harm already caused by climate change. However, UNFCCC members did not reach an agreement on how loss and damages will work in practice, so progress cannot be evaluated yet.</p><p>Three caveats should be made before looking at the progress high-income countries have made in providing public finance:</p><p>A political commitment is different from a legally binding goal.</p><p>Committed and disbursed funding are not synonyms.</p><p>Actual results depend on disbursed money being used for tangible purposes. Assessing whether that is the case is extremely important, but beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>$?100 billion a year</p><p>At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, developed countries pledged to jointly mobilise $?100 billion per year by 2020 to address climate change in developing countries. The decision was a rare example of a quantified climate-related finance target. The pledge was formalised one year later. The Paris climate summit decided that $?100 billion per year should be seen as a minimum, not a goal. The pledge included public, private, bilateral, multilateral and alternative funding.</p><p>So far, the pledge remains unfulfilled. Its reiteration along with the promise to live up to it soon have become an awkward ritual of the UN's annual climate summits. The gap seems to be closing, but progress has been painfully slow.</p><p>In 2022, the OECD published data on climate finance for the years 2013 to 2020. In that time span, disbursements increased by almost 60?%, from $?52 billion in 2013 to $?83?billion in 2020. Public finance (both bilateral and multilateral) played the largest role. Its share in total increased, from 73?% ($?38 billion) in 2013 to 82?% ($?68 billion) in 2020.</p><p>Assessments from WRI and ODI</p><p>The World Resources Institute (WRI), an independent think tank based in Washington D.C., also analysed finance for the period from 2013 to 2018. Adjusting data to eliminate double counting, it presented smaller numbers than the OECD. According to the WRI, bilateral and multilateral climate finance from high-income to developing countries amounted to only $?22 billion in 2013 and $?33 billion in 2018. Including outflows from multilateral development banks, the figures rose to $?34 billion in 2013 and $?55 billion in 2018.</p><p>According to either data set, high-income countries did not collectively meet their pledges. Attempts to break down responsibility country by country show that very few are contributing enough. The failure fits a pattern. In 1970, high-income countries pledged to spend an annual 0.7?% of their gross national income (GNI) on official development assistance (ODA). Collectively, they only disburse about 0.33?% of their joint GNI.</p><p>The WRI's analysis assessed how much each developed country should contribute towards the $?100 billion/year goal considering their GNI and population, which are proxies for responsibility and capacity for climate action. The authors calculated countries' fair share based on two different scenarios. The first was that at least $?70 billion of the total should be public finance. The second was that public finance would cover $?100 billion, given that this amount is a floor, not a target. The WRI concluded that, in 2018, only Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden paid their fair share under the first scenario, and only France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden did so under the second.</p><p>Britain's Overseas Development Institute (ODI) similarly concluded that in 2017/2018, only Norway, Sweden and Germany provided their fair share, with France and Japan coming close. The USA was at the bottom, providing a mere four percent of its fair share.</p><p>Why countries fail to comply</p><p>There are several reasons why developed countries fail to fulfil their pledges. First of all, there is no sanction for non-compliance. Most climate commitments are toothless, even if they are considered legally binding. Removing the threat of sanctions makes negotiations easier, but the price is a lack of incentives for countries to comply.</p><p>The collective nature of the pledge is another factor. At first glance, a collective pledge is easier to make since individual partners do not commit to a specific sum. In the longer run, of course, it is difficult to hold individual countries accountable for collective failure if there never was a clear agreement on burden sharing.</p><p>In addition, there is still a lot of debate about how to implement the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities (CBDR) within the UNFCCC. According to this principle, high-income countries should provide climate-related finance to developing countries. Yet countries disagree about how they should be held accountable for past emissions, and how current emissions should be addressed. These arguments generate more heat than light. As a matter of fact, no country is a monolithic entity, so governments pay attention to a variety of interests. Moreover, country groups are very heterogeneous too.</p><p>Growing polarisation</p><p>Finally, the international system is changing, and those changes have impacts on climate negotiations. Strategic competition of the USA and China is increasingly polarising the multilateral scenario, with countries taking sides on political, economic and technological issues. The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have further deepened the divide.</p><p>It also matters that the US has a long history of slowing down climate action. In 2001, President George Bush Jr. withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that it created an unfair trade advantage for China. In 2017, President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Although President Joe Biden has reinstated climate change as a key issue, the current fragmentation in American politics makes it less likely that the US will assume its fair share of responsibility. Tensions between the two countries affect prospects for international cooperation in general. Like the rest of the world, both the USA and China have a rational interest in tackling climate change. Yet it remains to be seen if they will be able to collaborate in this area as competition on other issues increases.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Money can also be allocated via other multilateral institutions, especially multilateral development banks, which then fund efforts in developing countries.

In the aftermath of such events, hundreds of thousands of people are normally in need of emergency water and sanitation assistance. Climate and conflict-driven internal migration and displacement add to the difficulties. What's more, Pakistan is experiencing an economic crisis that has left the government overwhelmed. Authorities are struggling to manage food scarcity, restore livelihoods and control spiralling inflation. The World Bank's 2022 Country and Climate Development Report paints a dire picture of Pakistan's future unless immediate action is taken to address climate change and environmental degradation. The report predicts that, if the country fails to act, it could see its annual GDP plummet by a shocking 18 to 20 % per year by 2050. Water shortages in agriculture alone could make up over 4.6 % of GDP losses. As of 2020, Pakistan had the lowest water productivity in southern Asia. Yet the livelihoods of the poorest critically depend on access to water services, and shortages affect them badly.</p><p>Sundus Saleemi</p><p>02.05.2023</p><p>Why Pakistan's economy is in deep crisis</p><p>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE</p><p>The mismatch that compounds Pakistan's governance problems</p><p>Contaminated water puts children at risk</p><p>Access to safe water and sanitation is limited, with climate change and rapid urbanisation making matters worse. Even some health centres and schools lack proper water and sanitation infrastructure. That poses problems especially for girls, who need adequate facilities to manage their menstruation.</p><p>According to UNICEF, 25 million people in the country still practice open defecation, a leading cause of waterborne diseases. UNICEF estimates that 70 % rely on bacterially contaminated water. As a result, around 53,000 Pakistani children under the age of five die from diarrhoea every year. Education outcomes are affected as well: children who experience repeated bouts of diarrhoea are likely to fall behind in school or even drop out entirely. Diarrhoeal disease can also cause stunting, which currently affects almost 44 % of children in Pakistan. Stunting prevents children from growing and developing as they should.</p><p>Pakistan's National Water Policy, which was approved in 2018, faces several significant implementation challenges. Relevant issues are water infrastructure, institutional capacity and political will. One of the most pressing topics is the lack of adequate water-storage capacity, which leads to a shortage of water both in times of drought and floods. The shortage is exacerbated by inefficient and outdated irrigation systems, which waste a significant amount of water.</p><p>The country's institutional capacities are too weak to implement the National Water Policy. The policy calls for the creation of a National Water Council and a National Water Regulatory Authority to oversee water management and ensure compliance with the policy's guidelines. However, the government has been slow to establish these institutions. It has also failed to properly define their future responsibilities and roles.</p><p>Political will is also a major challenge. The National Water Policy calls for significant reforms in the management of water resources, including the regulation of groundwater extraction and the promotion of water conservation measures. However, these reforms may prove unpopular, particularly among influential agricultural and industrial lobbies, and may thus face political resistance.</p><p>In light of these challenges, the Pakistani government has launched several initiatives to improve food security and address the country's water crisis. These include investments in irrigation infrastructure, support for smallholder farmers, and the construction of new dams and reservoirs. However, much more needs to be done if Pakistan is to meet the challenges of its rapidly growing population, hostile geography, and climate vulnerability.</p><p>Transparency and accountability</p><p>One of the key issues in Pakistan's water governance is the lack of transparency and accountability. Corruption and favouritism in water distribution have been reported in several parts of the country, particularly in the context of large-scale irrigation schemes. These practices not only undermine the efficient use of water resources, but also exacerbate social and economic disparities. Small farmers and marginalised communities are often left without adequate access to water.</p><p>Another challenge in Pakistan's water governance is the lack of effective regulation and enforcement of water laws and policies. Despite the existence of the National Water Policy and various provincial water management frameworks, implementation has been weak and inconsistent. This has resulted in a fragmented and often conflicting regulatory environment, with multiple agencies and stakeholders that lack clear roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Overall, addressing the challenges of weak water governance in Pakistan will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including the government, civil society organisations and the private sector. These stakeholders should focus on investing in the development of institutional capacity, promoting transparency and accountability in water management and ensuring the effective regulation and enforcement of water laws and policies.</p><p>In Pakistan, the climate crisis is primarily a water crisis. It cannot be avoided, but timely adaptation measures can help Pakistan reduce the extent of harm. The clock is ticking, and the longer we wait, the worse it will get.</p><p>Imran Mukhtar</p><p>22.09.2022</p><p>Pakistan is paying price for neglect of climate adaptation</p><p>The way forward</p><p>Experts who participated in the Pakistan Water Week 2022 in Islamabad made five key recommendations to improve water governance in Pakistan:</p><p>Policymakers should focus on strengthening the institutions responsible for water governance by providing them with the necessary resources and training to carry out their responsibilities effectively. A renewed focus on investing in water infrastructure, including sanitation, is needed as well. Public investments should complement civil society efforts.</p><p>Effective devolution is essential. Pakistan's province governments should take the lead in implementing initiatives to improve water storage, conservation, recycling and reuse as best suited to their needs.</p><p>Technology should be used to build trust and ensure transparency. Provinces should share water-flow data automatically. Data-based evidence should guide decisions regarding water allocation, use and management.</p><p>Journalism that addresses water and climate-related issues should be better funded. Powerful and resourceful media owners must be made aware of the severity of the water and climate crises.</p><p>Women and youth must be involved in debates concerning the water sector at the national and province levels. Both groups have an important role to play in shaping water use, now and in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, Pakistan needs to go beyond rhetoric and address water as national security issue in 2023, which can also be an election year. If citizens treat water security as an integral part of economic security and insist that political parties promise water sector reforms and investments in their slogans, it could create an opportunity to hold those parties accountable once they come to power. If institutions and policymakers cooperate effectively, they can reduce water-related impacts on Pakistan's people and economy.</p><p>Pakistan's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than one percent, so its vulnerability to climate impacts is disproportionately high. Access to adequate climate finance and support would help Pakistan to address these challenges effectively, enhance its resilience and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change and its adverse effects.</p><p>Abdur Rehman Cheema holds a PhD from Massey University, New Zealand, and has been a Chevening post-doctoral fellow at the University of Oxford.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Imran Mukhtar22. 09.

It was fundamental to stay in line with the target of 1.5 degrees (34.7 Fahrenheit), she stressed.  <br/>For her own country, this meant staying committed to \"the goal of climate neutrality by 2045,\" Baerbock went on to say.  <br/>What did Egypt say?  <br/>Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said at a joint press conference with Baerbock that the Petersberg talks were about finding \"areas of agreement and possible disagreement\" on climate issues that needed to be worked out in more detail in the months leading up to COP 27.  <br/>He said progress was needed in climate adaptation and mitigation as well as in how to respond to loss and damages. Regions that were the most affected by climate change should be supported more, Zhukri stressed in the press conference.  <br/>He said it was important to \"keep the international climate goals alive\" while \"leaving no one behind.\" A failure of the climate conference was \"not an option\" for the global community. <br/>los/aw (Reuters, dpa, AFP) <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

For example, when new species are discovered in Africa, it is usually by foreigners. Even if a species is native to Africa, it is often a person from the global north who is considered an expert on it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such parachute science hinders African countries from developing the expertise to collect, organise and retain scientific information. This results in limited utilisation of valuable knowledge. For example, changes in certain species have not been tracked over time, since there is a lack of permanent research on the ground. Today, a lot of relevant scientific knowledge is scattered, lost or non-existent.</p><p>Parachute science also extends to biodiversity conservation and climate adaptation strategies. Many strategies are designed by development partners in the global north. They possess the financial resources to collaborate with African governments to tweak strategies that may have been successful somewhere else. This can be likened to a cookie-cutter approach, whereby consultants apply the same strategy with slight modifications to different ecological regions.</p><p>Why do you criticise that?</p><p>In the case of biodiversity conservation, this approach misses out on valuable local knowledge and the opportunity to build agency and stewardship. It neglects building abilities among African scientists and fails to foster forward-thinking individuals and innovators who can develop culturally embedded solutions.</p><p>Africa's capacity must be strengthened, however. We need to start relying on people from the continent who speak the local language and know the culture well to generate holistic and local solutions. Overcoming parachute science is crucial for this purpose.</p><p>What solutions has your team been working on?</p><p>At the Center for Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural Resource Management at the University of Rwanda, we are training young researchers in Rwanda and the region at large. We equip them with skills to analyse biodiversity, identify species and explain why they are important. This includes studying biological indicators - species that can be used to monitor environmental changes. For example, if a certain species of pollution-sensitive frog is absent from a wetland, that is an indicator of an unhealthy wetland ecosystem. The same holds true for certain plants and dragonflies.</p><p>Enabling local experts who can identify species and understand ecosystem dynamics is crucial. This also closes the circle to agriculture. After all, quite a few newly discovered species are important for soil fertility and crop productivity, on which productive farming depends.</p><p>What are the imminent threats to biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa?</p><p>Demand for agricultural land is a major threat. Poverty and rapid population growth increase the need for land for agriculture and housing. In Africa, this has led to the conversion of forests into farmland, resulting in significant impacts on biodiversity.</p><p>The main biodiversity issues in Africa stem from the conflict between biodiversity and agriculture. Farming dominates land use in most African countries, including in Rwanda. Ideally, food security and biodiversity should go hand in hand. However, forests are being cleared at an unprecedented rate for agriculture. National agriculture policies in many countries prioritise intensifying agriculture to feed the population. But we need to prioritise nature-positive food production as well. Additionally, international demand for agricultural produce from Africa leads to monocropping and a focus on commercial crops.</p><p>The massive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, often undocumented and unregulated, is a problem too. We do not know enough about how these chemicals are being used and where. What we do know, however, is that they pollute freshwater ecosystems and negatively affect pollinators. While African countries need higher productivity, agricultural intensification clearly has negative impacts on human health and biodiversity if not well planned.</p><p>What other threats are there to biodiversity?</p><p>The expansion of infrastructure like networks of roads result in loss of habitat, human-wildlife conflicts and deaths of animals. A related aspect, and also a big issue, is urbanisation. It currently has less immediate impact than agriculture, however, since most urban areas have a long history of human settlement. When urbanisation is planned properly, it allows for green growth and has positive potential for biodiversity.</p><p>Finally, illegal wildlife trade is a major problem. The huge demand for various bird, mammal and fish species, especially in wealthy world regions, is driving this trade. It is pushing species like pangolins, elephants and rhinos towards extinction.</p><p>Is there a particular issue that concerns you the most as a biologist, scientist and teacher?</p><p>I am alarmed by the extent to which people are moving away from nature. In many African countries, as in many parts of the world today, people are not able to identify native trees or animals in their immediate surroundings. For example, eucalyptus dominates the landscape in many countries in Africa, yet many people are unaware that it originates from Australia. Similarly, bamboo used for restoration plantings often comes from China.</p><p>Young people often don't encounter a lot of native species, except in protected areas, which are often exclusively accessible to tourists. This holds true for Rwanda, for example. In the Central African Republic, some forest cover exists, but wildlife is scarce in many of these areas. The growing disconnection between humans and nature leads to a lack of concern, resulting in a vicious circle of rapid biodiversity loss.</p><p>In fact, we do not even know what species or varieties are going extinct, since we lack a comprehensive list of African species. As interest wanes, valuable oral and indigenous knowledge disappears. US and European institutions do have valuable knowledge regarding African biodiversity, but this information is needed in Africa too. Our understanding remains insufficient, particularly at the local level. It is obvious that we cannot effectively protect what we do not know.</p><p>What solutions do you consider feasible?</p><p>At the policy-level, more needs to be done to explore innovative ways to enhance biodiversity. In order to reach food-security goals, we need to explore how to create a patchwork of connected landscapes that support both biodiversity and human needs.</p><p>At the individual level, people should be inspired to reconnect to the nature around them. One method of doing so - and at the same time generating scientific knowledge - is cataloguing and building a database of the amazing species that can be found in different African countries. Highlighting unique species and their significance can arouse people's interest and passion.</p><p>Research shows that effective conservation requires the support of local citizens. They need to know about biodiversity in their region, have the capability to track it and know when change is happening. Policymakers should include this information in their planning. Building knowledge and expertise at the local level is essential. We cannot solely rely on what is called parachute science or helicopter science.</p><p>Beth Kaplin directs the Center of Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural Resource Management at the University of Rwanda.

Development agencies have a unique opportunity to utilise feminist development policy as a foundation for comprehensive and profound change, addressing structural inequalities and dismantling oppressive power dynamics. After all, the BMZ has set the ambitious target of allocating 93 % of all of its project funds to measures to promote gender equality by 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Germany's feminist development policy aims for two guiding principles:</p><p>Intersectionality: it seeks to improve the situation for 'women and marginalised groups in all their diversity'. The strategy thus acknowledges that a person can be disadvantaged in several ways and due to a combination of their individual characteristics, such as ethnic or religious identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background or origin from rural, disadvantaged regions. For example, female refugees may be stigmatised for their gender and their migratory experience.</p><p>Postcolonialism: the strategy's postcolonial claim intends to critically reflect entrenched power structures and contribute to dismantling unequal treatment based on patriarchal or racist power gaps.</p><p>Key areas of the strategy are 'three Rs' and respective measures:</p><p>Rights of women and other marginalised groups must be protected by replacing discriminatory laws with gender-responsive laws and supporting their implementation. They include sexual and reproductive rights, prevention of violence, human rights, land rights or digital rights as well as rights to health services, education and economic opportunities.</p><p>Resources need to be equally accessible to and controlled by all genders. They comprise access to education, labour markets, financial systems, land, digital technologies, social protection, health, sanitation and funding as well as protection from climate risks and food insecurity.</p><p>Representation means the equal and meaningful participation of women and other marginalised groups in important social, political and economic decisionmaking processes at all levels. They range from planning and budgeting decisions in economic and tax systems to equal participation in peace processes and a stronger role for women in the development and use of digital technologies.</p><p>A tall order</p><p>The strategy is timely and much needed - but a tall order. Underlying power imbalances are difficult to identify let alone to reduce, and the 'three Rs' offer a list of good things that do not necessarily go together. Priority setting must be key. At the same time, there is no prioritisation that can consider all the diverse interests and local conditions.</p><p>The social contract framework offers a possible starting point to deal with this. It helps to understand how different groups in a society have rights and responsibilities, and how power dynamics and compromises play a role. It shows that the government provides goods and services to its citizens in return for their acceptance of its authority. Social contracts contribute to establishing stable relationships between the government and society by avoiding the need to constantly renegotiate the terms of their interaction.</p><p>Whether social contracts make the relationship between state and society more predictable, resilient and equitable, depends on who is entitled to which goods and services within state and society. According to researchers from the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS), these goods and services can be categorised as the 'three Ps'. These 'three Ps' are similar to the 'three Rs' of the feminist policy and can help to prioritise between them:</p><p>Protection differentiates between collective security (e.g., against external threats), human security (e.g., against physical threats or criminal attacks) and legal security (e.g., enforcing human and civil rights, rule of law).</p><p>Provision means basic public services, especially access to resources, infrastructure, social services and economic opportunities.</p><p>Participation refers to the state's willingness to give its citizens a voice in political decisionmaking processes on different levels.</p><p>Governments fail their duties</p><p>Ideally, governments fulfil their responsibilities and provide all three Ps to every citizen. However, governments often fail to meet one or more of these duties. This may be due to budgetary constraints, for example if the cost of universal health care is too high. Political motivations are another reason. Authoritarian leaders may prioritise security and service delivery but expect citizens to give up their rights to participate in decision-making and legal protection. Sometimes rights are denied to all citizens, sometimes a policy of 'divide and rule' gives some groups more rights than others.</p><p>Women are particularly often disadvantaged. This was most recently demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic. They had to do the additional care work as schools and kindergartens were temporarily closed (that is, the state had to reduce provision). Moreover, women are often in less stable employment with fewer workers' rights and are more at risk of losing their jobs (that means they lack protection).</p><p>Helping stakeholders to implement truly gender sensitive policies</p><p>Considering state-society relations and changing social contracts helps stakeholders in the development context to identify which issues are most disputed in a given context and which rights, resources and representative positions are currently inaccessible to certain groups. It also helps policymakers to understand which development interventions are transformative and cannot simply be reversed later.</p><p>The development community can expand its influence in promoting gender-\u00adsensitive policies by paying attention to social contracts. For example, this approach helps to realise that simply increasing the number of female representatives in a country's decisionmaking bodies may not necessarily lead to transformative change. In some cases, it may even reinforce existing power imbalances if the chosen representatives are not only female but also part of a longstanding privileged elite.</p><p>Alliances not only with feminist organisations but also within society at large are necessary for more inclusive development. It is crucial to also include men, ethnic leaders or religious elites to understand their interests and reservations. Development actors should take this into account when selecting their cooperation partners and beneficiaries. Feminist policy calls for role models with whom women and other marginalised groups can truly identify.</p><p>In the face of crises as well as future challenges such as climate adaptation or digitalisation, feminist policies are more necessary than ever for truly transformative and inclusive development.

Yet this week, the politicians, banking experts, civil society group leaders, and others who are gathering at that intersection ? at a two-day event organized by French President Emmanuel Macron called The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact ? are pushing an agenda that appears to be putting financing for African natural gas projects, the presumptive solution to many of the continent?s poverty woes, on the back burner, no pun intended. The Paris summit was designed to lay the groundwork ?for a new financial system suited to the common challenges of the 21st century, such as fighting inequalities and climate change and protecting biodiversity.? Though summit attendees didn?t arrive with an exact vision for what a new financial system would look like, their discussion is coalescing around four pillars: Restore fiscal space to countries facing short-term difficulties, especially the most indebted countries.  Foster private sector development in low-income countries.  Encourage investment in \"green\" infrastructure for the energy transition in emerging and developing countries.  Mobilize innovative financing for countries vulnerable to climate change. The truth is, we do need a new global financial system. It?s no secret that poor countries have more difficulty accessing financing for development projects that support economic and social growth than rich countries, and when they do, the cost of money is considerably higher, staggeringly so in some cases. It?s not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it?s become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal. And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it ? and welcome it. It?s the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects. Valid Finance Concerns?Up to a Point To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation?s capital city. Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis. When Mottley ? an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas. Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank?s biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank?s then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass? leadership, the World Bank did too little to ?align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts? ? while it continues to fund oil and gas projects). Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world?s economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments. The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to ?mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.? And, again, that?s an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa?s gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa. To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that?s not what we?re seeing. Look at Afrieximbank?s Excellent Example In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa?s important domestic banks. For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to ?invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,? and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine ?our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.? As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies. Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that? At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in ?revitalizing Africa?s climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.? To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables. This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa?s economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What?s more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa?s much-needed industrialization, we all know that?s not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now. All of this requires money. As I?ve written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won?t work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN?s sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept. \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said. The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that?  At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in \"revitalizing Africa's climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.\"  To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables.  This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas  Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa's economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What's more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa's much-needed industrialization, we all know that's not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now.  All of this requires money.  As I've written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won't work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN's sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept.  \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said.  The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

That analysis showed that there is a broad consensus on the need for such programmes and their benefits within the scientific community and at international organisations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Studies confirm that green programmes can be very effective drivers of economic recovery, sometimes even more effective than conventional measures. For example, investment in renewable energy pays off more in macroeconomic terms than state support for fossil fuels. Investment in nature conservation, too, can have a very high multiplier effect, meaning that it generates high impacts on demand and employment. Money spent on unsustainable land use, on the other hand, tends to have a negative impact on an economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Criteria for green measures</p><p>There is widespread agreement in the scientific community on the criteria that green stimulus measures should meet. It is important that they:</p><p>are feasible in the short run,</p><p>have a high impact on demand and employment (targeted),</p><p>place only a temporary strain on state budgets (temporary) and</p><p>make a positive contribution to socio-ecological transformation (see Sabine Balk's article on the need for a socio-ecological transformation on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Some economic areas are particularly suitable for sustainable recovery programmes. They include non-fossil energy production, energy-efficient building renovation, sustainable mobility and measures for the ecological transformation of industry. The last area mentioned encompasses, for example, the development of a hydrogen-based economy and the promotion of technologies to increase energy and material efficiency. Climate adaptation measures and nature-based solutions such as reforestation are also often rated very highly.</p><p>Which particular measures can be feasibly implemented depends partly on country-specific circumstances, such as economic structure and administrative, technical and financial capacities, and partly on the availability of projects that are already planned and can be swiftly implemented.</p><p>Evaluations of existing green recovery programmes show significant differences. In industrialised countries the range of support areas is very broad, whereas in emerging economies and developing countries the focus is often solely on the development of renewable energy - especially solar energy - and preservation of the natural capital stock, for example economically important ecosystem services such as forests or marine sanctuaries.</p><p>Just a flash in the pan</p><p>Studies on green economic recovery programmes launched during the 2008/2009 financial and economic crisis show that they might only have a momentary effect. For example, although global greenhouse gas emissions declined slightly in 2009, they rose sharply again in 2010. The main reasons for the upturn were low energy prices and high government spending on fossil fuel-based activities.</p><p>Therefore, it is necessary to check all economic stimulus measures for environmentally harmful and climate-damaging effects and to embed green recovery programmes in structural reforms. This includes dismantling environmentally harmful subsidies and implementing carbon pricing. In addition, regulatory barriers need to be removed and green investment targets set.</p><p>It is also important to promote green financial instruments, build green infrastructures such as charging points for electric vehicles, expand public transport networks and power grids, and launch training programmes so that the social and ecological transformation is not hampered by a shortage of skilled workers.</p><p>Policy-making is lagging behind</p><p>More than two years after the onset of the corona crisis, questions need to be addressed about the extent to which policy-makers heeded the recommendations of the scientific community and the scale on which green economic recovery programmes were implemented. The answer is sobering: from a global perspective, green recovery measures played a minor role to combat the corona crisis.</p><p>The Global Recovery Observatory - a platform created by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), IMF and GIZ to promote knowledge exchange and green fiscal policy - tracks countries' COVID-19 recovery spending. It estimates that total spending worldwide on measures to address the crisis amounted to around US$ 18 trillion (as of August 2022), most of which went on short-term rescue efforts. Only a little over US$ 3 trillion was longer-term recovery spending and less than a third of that was used to fund green programmes.</p><p>Even so, compared to the 2008/2009 financial crisis the importance of green economic recovery measures has increased significantly. Evidence of this can be seen, among other places, in many EU countries, partly as a result of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility earmarking considerable financial resources for green measures.</p><p>Green recovery spending has been confined to relatively few countries, most of them in the industrialised world. This is largely due to the fact that the financial resources of developing and emerging economies are much more limited. In 2020, per capita spending on recovery programmes in industrial countries was 17 times higher than in developing and emerging economies. This shows how important debt relief and targeted financial support by the industrialised world is. They empower developing and emerging nations, too, to implement green programmes.</p><p>Moreover, green programmes' positive impacts on the environment are often counteracted by negative impacts from other stimulus measures. The IMF found that in the Group of 20 leading economic nations (G20), 1.4% of corona spending in 2020 had a positive climate impact, while 1.7% was harmful to the climate. Analyses by the Global Recovery Observatory conclude that only 3% of expenditures on economic recovery have a positive effect on the natural capital stock but 17% of spending has a negative impact. With regard to the goal of air pollution control, the positive and negative impacts are more or less equal. These are shocking findings and underline the importance of applying environmental and sustainability checks to all stimulus measures.</p><p>Whether the world as a whole will emerge from the crisis greener as a result of the corona programmes that have been implemented is impossible to say at this stage. It is too early to make a final judgement because programmes are still ongoing and quantitative impact studies are hardly available.</p><p>Because of the war in Ukraine, the world is now once again in an economic crisis. And the measures taken in response to that crisis will again be decisive. If the sharp rise in fossil fuel prices is used as an opportunity to promote energy efficiency, green energy and post-fossil production technologies, the crisis could become a catalyst for sustainable development. Developing countries and emerging economies urgently need support in this regard because the constraints on their financial capacities have been even intensified by the current surge in energy and food prices and the economic crisis.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the response to sharply rising fossil fuel prices and gas supply shortages is to subsidise fossil fuels even more and to develop new sources of fossil fuels, the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement will hardly be achievable any more.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["They include non-fossil energy production, energy-efficient building renovation, sustainable mobility and measures for the ecological transformation of industry.

That was the highest level in half a century. Private and public debts increased fast in industrialised nations, emerging economies and developing countries, with loans being sourced domestically and abroad (see Roli Mahajan on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reckons that 60 % of low-income countries were heavily indebted in 2022. The comparative share for 2015 was only about 30 %.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It matters very much that, in many countries, debt services in relation to exports rose considerably. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, they increased from 16 % in 2019 to 22 % in 2020. The implication is that a greater share of exports revenues had to be used for debt servicing, reducing the scope of investments in sustainability-related matters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Large budgetary deficits</p><p>In many developing countries and emerging markets, the deficits in government budgets have skyrocketed. In sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, according to the IMF, the deficit was -3.9 % in 2019, but -6.4 % in 2020. The figures were worse for oil-importing countries (-4.3 % in 2019 and -7.3 % in 2020) than for oil-exporting countries (-3.3 % and - 4.6 % respectively).</p><p>The deficits were incurred to cope with costs of the pandemic. At the same time, tax revenues decreased in many countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, taxation tends to be quite a bit lower than in high-income countries.</p><p>War in Ukraine</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February has made matters worse. It has led to yet higher debts and surges in inflation. Especially the increase in energy and food prices are a burden on national budgets and foreign trade balances. Commodity-importing countries are affected in particular.</p><p>Monetary policy has tightened in many high-income countries, causing interest rates to rise on international financial markets. Debt servicing is thus becoming more expensive. Heavy debts stand in the way of economic recovery and will have long-term impacts in business as well as social terms. It is also to be feared that investments to combat climate change will decline.</p><p>Ways out of debt</p><p>To manage debt crises, the countries concerned need reforms as well as external support. Their fiscal power is too small. The international community created new policy instruments during the pandemic and should now make full use of them. The Group of 20 major industrialised and emerging economies (G20) has adopted two instruments of relevance to developing countries.</p><p>The Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) is a debt moratorium for low-income countries to solve short-term liquidity problems. During the moratorium period from May 2020 to December 2021, it has been used by 48 of the 73 eligible countries.</p><p>The Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond DSSI is designed to restructure and - if necessary - even forgive debts accrued by low-income countries. The idea is to prevent both sovereign defaults and long-lasting payment difficulties. So far, however, only three countries have taken part: Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia (see a previous contribution of mine on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Implementation has been delayed mainly due to coordination difficulties among creditors (Georgieva, K./C. Pazarbasioglu, 2021). Involving all private and public creditors would help. Moreover, transparency regarding loan conditions is needed. Otherwise, equal treatment of creditors cannot be ensured. It would make sense to expand the Common Framework beyond low-income countries, given that middle-income countries are struggling too. Moreover, an insolvency procedure for sovereign states is necessary.</p><p>In the longer run, it would be good to draft and adopt codes of conduct for responsible lending and borrowing. The international community should support related initiatives. Relevant institutions, such as the G20, the UN, the OECD and the Institute of International Finance have drafted such codes and are enforcing them to some extent. To avoid divergence, these codes should be acknowledged and harmonised internationally (Berensmann 2022).</p><p>Build back better</p><p>The pandemic proved that our societies are susceptible to shocks. At the same time, we now have the opportunity to build back better in ways that boost future resilience. Current financial crises should be seen as opportunities to restructure debts with an eye to promoting sustainable development (Volz et al. 2021).</p><p>The implication is that the Common Framework should be linked to investments in climate action. Debt relief and debt restructuring should be geared to achieving the sustainable development goals of the UN's 2030 agenda as well as fulfilling the aspirations of the Paris Climate Agreement. In a similar sense, the toolkit of multilateral development banks should serve these purposes too (Berensmann et al. 2022).</p><p>Global heating is causing financial harm. Therefore, debt sustainability assessments must take climate-related risks into account. Investments in climate adaptation should count too, since they reduce climate risks. The IMF is currently working on proposals concerning how to mainstream climate issues in fiscal policy (Massetti / Bellon 2022).</p><p>Tax reforms</p><p>Developing countries, however, must mobilise more domestic resources and become less dependent on foreign debt. Raising more tax revenues is absolutely essential. Both tax administration and tax policy should improve. To broaden the tax base, tax systems must become more transparent, more efficient and more effective. The informal sector should not remain beyond taxation. Technical assistance from high-income countries should prove useful, especially in regard to the digitalisation of national revenue services.</p><p>The internationals tax system must improve too. That is essential for stemming illicit financial flows, tax evasion and tax avoidance. The African Union Commission reckons that illicit financial flows annually deprive African governments of some $ 50 billion to $ 80 billion (AU Commission, 2019). These estimates are by definition difficult, but the figures are definitely huge.</p><p>Two important initiatives are:</p><p>The establishment of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes</p><p>The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).</p><p>The Global Forum is the most important international institution for fighting tax evasion and tax avoidance. It is enhancing transparency in the international tax system and currently has 165 members. Its secretariat is hosted by the OECD. The Inclusive Framework on BEPS is designed to fight tax evasion, boost the coherence of international tax rules, increase the transparency of tax systems and support taxes on digital businesses (von Haldenwang / Laudage 2019). Donors should increase the technical assistance they offer developing countries in this field.</p><p>The developing countries, in turn, must improve their debt management and use their fiscal means more efficiently. Important dimensions include balancing foreign and domestic debts carefully as well as paying appropriate attention to both interest rates and the duration of loans. Good debt management also leads to greater transparency and can drive the growth of domestic bond markets. Such markets can provide a good source of income for developing countries.</p><p>References</p><p>AU Commission, 2019: Domestic resource mobilization: Fighting against corruption and illicit financial flows.

But a lack of expertise on the ground has also stalled crucial adaptation projects.From cyclones in the south, to floods and drought in the east: Climate change is already leaving its mark on the African continent. Although Africa accounts for the world's smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 just 3.8% \u2014 it's paying a severe price for a crisis it did little to help create. </p><p><br/>Many experts acknowledge that climate finance is crucial for Africa to be able to adapt to the growing impacts of climate change. Over a decade ago, wealthy nations pledged $100 billion (\u20ac91 billion) a year to developing nations by 2020 for this very purpose. <br/>Now \u2014 two years past the deadline \u2014 developed countries estimate they won't fulfill this pledge until 2023. And they're under increasing pressure to make good on their promise. <br/>\"We need to understand that Africa is warming faster than the entire globe,\" Richard Munang, the Africa climate change coordinator at the UN Environment Program (UNEP) told DW. <br/>\"The challenges of food insecurity and the socio-economic challenges that we are facing will only continue and put Africa in a very precarious situation. What is needed now is adaptation that drives resilience of communities.\" <br/>Needs continue to mount <br/>With Africa's share of the world's population expected to grow from 17% to 40% by 2100, the clock is ticking on climate adaptation projects. The continent is also struggling to maintain its momentum on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 which were adopted by all UN member states in 2015 in a bid to end poverty and increase climate resilience by 2030 \u2014 as well as its own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). <br/>\"Africa today needs $2 trillion to implement the NDCs,\" explains Munang. \"And on top of this, the continent needs $1.2 trillion to implement the SDGs. It is therefore imperative that support for Africa to [implement] climate resilience happens.\" <br/>Munang points to recent natural disasters as evidence that the global community needs to act on their pledge as soon as possible. <br/>\"You see mothers going hungry, crop failure, floods, drought and the displacement of people These realities are only going to increase under the changing climate. <br/>Project expertise missing <br/>But this narrative only partly explains Africa's dilemma. While some funds intended for climate change mitigation projects have made their way to the continent, it often unclear exactly how they are being used \u2014 or how they can be accessed in the first place. <br/>Adeline Tengem, a Cameroonian forestry technician and NGO leader, says she has tried to access climate financing several times without success. <br/>\"Our idea is to restore the degraded landscape while improving the livelihoods of local communities surrounding those landscapes,\" she told DW. \"So far, we have been struggling to access funding to carry out these kinds of projects. Each time I submit projects, they would reject it because [they said] it was of low quality.\" <br/>Tengem isn't alone in her struggle. Peter Gondo from the United Nations Forum on Forests says difficulty accessing climate financing is a recognized problem across the continent. He says it often comes down to a lack of expertise in formulating project proposals that meet the requirements of climate finance sources. <br/>\"[Applicants need] to demonstrate how the projects that they want funded contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation,\" he explains. \"This requires a lot of detailed, accurate data to estimate how much you are going to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if you implement the project. Many countries do not have enough experts with adequate skills to do that.\" <br/>Training for a better future <br/>To try and get more climate projects off the ground, the African Forest Forum has partnered with the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network (GFFFN). Together, they organize training sessions for forest stakeholders from the public sector and NGOs on \"climate finance and writing bankable projects.\" <br/>Tengem took part in a workshop in Douala, where she learned not only what kind of funding opportunities are available to her, but how to draft projects that meet funding requirements. She says she's now more confident in submitting her future proposals. <br/>\"I have learnt the mechanism that will take me from problem to solution, which is what the [financing] partners want.\" <br/>Ultimately, the initiative aims to help ensure that Africa will gain easier access to existing and future international climate finance. Sector stakeholders say with both adequate financing and expertise, Africa should on the path towards a low emission and climate resilient future. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

They can end extreme poverty - and prevent it from childhood to old age.</p><p>A core function of social-protection schemes is to boost peoples' resilience to shocks shocks (see Markus Loewe on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). That includes individual shocks, such as an illness or job loss, as well as collective shocks, such as a drought or flooding. Experts speak of 'adaptive' social protection when schemes are designed to respond fast to collective shocks by adjusting modalities and scaling support. In the event of a collective shock, affected people who already receive benefits can temporarily get extra support. Moreover, coverage should be expanded to additional people who now qualify for support. An adaptive system does so in a far-reaching, fast and flexible manner. Ideally, the system will anticipate collective shocks and provide additional support even before they hit, boosting vulnerable peoples resilience and preventing the shock from triggering a full-blown crisis (regarding social-protection and refugees, see Maren Suchta-Platzmann and Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Schmitz on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>The adaptiveness of a social-protection system hinges on several factors, including:</p><p>data and information-processing systems that facilitate the identification of vulnerable people and link that information to risk assessments,</p><p>robust delivery infrastructure, including for digital payments, so people are reached reliably,</p><p>financial buffers to allow urgently needed money to be disbursed fast,</p><p>financial buffers for reserves lined up for rapid disbursement.</p><p>One example is the multilateral 'Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program' (SASPP). It is run by the World Bank. Germany is its most important donor. The SASPP is being implemented in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Chad. The idea is to gradually develop the countries' nascent social-protection programmes into comprehensive and adaptive systems.</p><p>The SASPP focuses on preventing drought-induced food crises. Due to its adaptive nature, it nonetheless proved useful during the Covid-19 pandemic, with more than 4.6 million people in the Sahel region receiving additional cash transfers by September 2021.</p><p>It is possible to combine basic social-protection schemes with measures that help people to adapt to climate change, for example by diversifying economic activities. Experts speak of 'economic inclusion'. The Partnership for Economic Inclusion is a global network which is coordinated by the World Bank and promotes such approaches, for example in Niger in the context of the SASPP.</p><p>Moreover, strong social-protection systems can reduce the need for humanitarian relief in times of crisis. An increasing number of developing countries are buying sovereign climate-risk insurance. It en\u00adtitles them to financial payouts, for example, should they be hit by severe drought. So far, the insurance payouts are mainly channelled through the humanitarian system to people in need. Yet, efforts are underway to use the national social-protection systems instead.</p><p>Lessons from the pandemic</p><p>In response to Covid-19, almost every country adopted some social-protection measures to cushion the socio-economic impacts (World Bank 2020). Without them, even more people would have fallen deeper into poverty (UNDP 2021). In this sense, the pandemic proved that social protection does indeed mitigate the impacts of collective shocks.</p><p>However, dramatic disparities between nations became strikingly evident. Where strong social-protection systems were in place, governments could respond to this major crisis comparatively well. Where the need is greatest, by contrast, such systems are often still in their infancy or do not exist at all. Of the world population, 53 % are not covered by social-protection systems. In Africa, the rate is even higher: 83 %. Many programmes are quite slow, moreover, and more funding is needed too.</p><p>These things have implications for tackling the climate crisis. Where the vulnerability to climate impacts is great, social-protection systems must improve fast. That is a core message of the Global Risk Report 2021, which was published by Bndnis \u00adEntwicklung Hilft, an alliance of Germany development and relief agencies (see Monika Hellstern on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Setting up social-protection systems is a long-term but worthwhile effort, as the Cambodian example shows. German agencies, including the GIZ, have been cooperating with the national government for more than ten years on developing mechanisms to identify poor households and creating the poverty registry IDPoor. During the pandemic, an additional 50,000 people could be registered within ten days in May 2020. So far, IDPoor has facilitated timely cash transfers to more than 2 million people.</p><p>Social justice and climate protection</p><p>In view of the climate crisis, we must make our societies and economies climate neutral. The core principle of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which the UN adopted in 2015, is to leave no one behind. However, some mitigation policies create or exacerbate social disparities, for example when jobs are lost in fossil industries or when prices of vital goods rise.</p><p>This is not only problematic from a social justice perspective. It also threatens the political viability of ambitious climate action. When they affect large sections of the population without compensation, protests may arise that may thwart implementation. In settings of this kind, adaptive social-protection systems have a stabilising and compensatory function. This is how social protection can facilitate a just transition to climate neutrality.</p><p>So far, however, there are only few examples of policymakers intentionally using social-protection schemes to make more ambitious climate action politically viable. In practice, such schemes have mostly served to cushion job losses, for example when coal mines are closed.</p><p>That said, some social-protection instruments are intentionally used in the context of climate mitigation. So-called 'payments for ecosystem services' programmes offer financial rewards either for verifiable eco-friendly action or for refraining from harmful practices such as unsustainable logging. To a growing extent, moreover, public works programmes are geared to green goals. Prominent examples include India's MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme.</p><p>The experience of the pandemic has proved once more just how important adaptive social-protection systems are for societies to cope with collective shocks. In view of escalating climate risks, such systems are becoming increasingly important. Therefore, it is high time to work together across sectors at all levels to strengthen these systems and close coverage gaps. This requires concerted efforts at the nexus of social protection, humanitarian assistance, climate adaptation, climate-risk finance and disaster-risk management.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["In view of escalating climate risks, such systems are becoming increasingly important.

As a result, it does not use resources efficiently. In his eyes, bottom-up approaches that start at the grassroots level are more promising.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. It is based in Nairobi. Does that make a difference in the eyes of East Africans?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, to some extent, having UNEP in the neighbourhood does lead to a sense of belonging and closeness. It also offers an opportunity for exchange, making it easier to contribute to the environmental agenda. If you consider the global role of UNEP, however, it is really only of minor relevance where the agency is based.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are tangible projects, however. Last year, UNEP joined forces with private-sector companies to publish air-pollution data on digitised billboards in Nairobi. The idea was to make people aware of the issue.</p><p>Yes, I have heard about this initiative and about similar ones too. They obviously make sense, but they should not belong to the core mission of UNEP. The agency should focus on more important and strategic things.</p><p>What do you have in mind?</p><p>The big issue is to redirect the global agenda towards integrated environmental protection and climate action. UNEP should ensure more is done around the world, but it shouldn't be involved in individual projects. Its real job should be to organise and coordinate at a higher level. The world is changing, and environmental problems have been getting worse. Business as usual is not an option anymore, but the UN system has remained the same. The UN must adapt to global change.</p><p>In what ways do you want the UN to change?</p><p>Effective environmental management should take bottom-up approaches. To solve problems, we must first consider what is needed at local and national levels - and that is what I said in our previous conversation (on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). At the UN level, the task is to create appropriate preconditions for such action. Least developed countries have not caused the climate problems, for example, but they are suffering the impacts. They need fast and efficient access to funding. There are currently too many institutions and too many layers of hierarchy. We do not need many specialised environment programmes. What we need is fewer, but better coordinated institutions. The goal should be to have one strong agency, rather than a broad range of agencies. At this point, UNEP is in charge of the environment, the Secretariat of the UNFCCC (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) is dealing with climate issues, and the UNDP (UN Development Programme) is promoting the sustainable development agenda, and they are only three of many relevant UN agencies. Of course, the World Bank, the African Development Bank and other multilateral institutions matter too.</p><p>Are some institutions superfluous in your eyes?</p><p>Well, my Ugandan experience shows that, when you're working at the grassroots level, it can be very hard to tell the difference between UNEP and the UNDP. Both institutions, moreover, should focus on international coordination. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) actually provide a good opportunity. If all UN agencies systematically used them as guidelines, their action would probably be coordinated better. After all, the SDGs spell out a coherent agenda, and none of them should be considered in isolation. The job of institutions like UNEP or the UNDP is to coordinate national governments for this purpose, but without duplication of efforts. The UN must become better at coordinating itself in order to become better at coordinating the global agenda.</p><p>Where exactly do you see deficits?</p><p>Just consider financing, for example. According to the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, only about 10 % of global climate finance meant for adaptation reached the local level for action in the years 2003 to 2016. A mere 10 %! Too much of the rest is spent on engaging intermediary organisations, consultancies and institutional overheads. A lot of money is being wasted because of very many unnecessary layers. Environmental finance should flow to where it is needed most to bring about the greatest impact.</p><p>Various development banks and funds are making money available for development projects.</p><p>Yes, exactly. We have the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund and various other institutions. Each one has its own application procedure. Each one has its own mechanisms for disbursing money and its own system of monitoring and reporting. In terms of both time and resources, all parties concerned are paying a very high price. If you want to get funding from one of them, you'll need specialised professional advice. It took the government of Uganda five years to get accreditation at the Green Climate Fund, for instance, and another two years went by, before it could access funding. Such a complex procedure would be acceptable if things were coordinated and coherent at later stages. They aren't. Everything keeps changing with different actors. Even if you have some experience with one institution, you have to start anew with the next one. That is not only Uganda's experience, but other countries' experience as well.</p><p>What does that mean for local-level projects?</p><p>Typically, several donors are involved in funding different projects, so funding for an individual project often runs out of breath fast. For example, a climate-adaptation project in village A will get money for a year, which is normally too short. When funding stops, the village is left to itself - with harmful impacts on the entire ecosystem. Far too many lessons are never learned. A few kilometres away, another donor may be funding similar efforts in village B. That project does not take into account what worked out well in village A - and what failed. The same mistakes are thus made again and again. Successful projects are rarely scaled up. Instead, we see pilot project after pilot project, which is quite inefficient. Inadequate coordination at the higher level thus has impacts at the lower levels.</p><p>Governments that get international funding are not speaking in one voice either. Should African governments do more to coordinate their stance?</p><p>Yes, absolutely. Generally speaking, I think that developing countries should do more in terms of questioning the status quo. Some African governments, however, tend to prevent better coordination. Instead, they intentionally foster a certain ambiguity because it serves powerful interests. It makes corruption easier to have a broad variety of funding agencies that all operate in their own special ways. African countries not only need better coordination, but governance as well.</p><p>The African office of UNEP hosts a forum that is meant to coordinate African governments in regard to environmental issues. Is the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) up to task?</p><p>There are various settings that are supposed to make Africa speak with one voice in environmental affairs, including at the level of ministers like the AMCEN. The Nile Basin Initiative is another supranational forum for discussing matters such as water-resources management or energy infrastructure. These bodies give governments scope for taking joint decisions and even settling disputes. The big challenges, of course, are always implementation and consistency.</p><p>Aid effectiveness has been a hot topic for decades. It does not look like the international community is heeding the lessons of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. In 2005, it emphasised issues such as national ownership, donor harmonisation and mutual accountability.</p><p>I do not expect the system to change top-down. If at all, change will have to happen bottom-up. The good news is there is some momentum. When representatives of grassroots initiatives and local governments are invited to meetings by UNEP or other global agencies, they increasingly ask: 'Is this about meetings and policies - or is this about action on ground?' They are tired of rhetoric and fancy sounding agreements. They want to know what exactly will happen in their community - and how that will relate to local needs. I think the hope is in the emerging locally-led revolutions. We need to see aid that fits people's needs, not the other way round.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 38, "title": "Opinion: Germany's floods highlight need for urgent climate action", "published": "2021-08-01", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aug 01, 2021( Deutsche Welle World: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429\">http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> As scientists warn that the floods mark the end of a stable climate, we must step up our efforts to minimize the damage extreme weather events cause, write Ban Ki-moon and\u202fPatrick Verkooijen.The recent catastrophic flooding across the Rhine basin and into Belgium and the Netherlands must be taken as a warning by countries across Europe and elsewhere of the increasingly urgent need to do more to adapt to and prepare for climate change. </p><p><br/>The full cost of the damage is not yet known, but repairs are likely to run into billions and take many months. <br/>While it is too early to know precisely the extent of climate change, scientists fear that damage caused by emissions is producing even worse extreme weather events than predicted. Brutal heatwaves seen recently along the western seaboard of the United States and Canada, as well as in Siberia and other parts of the world, are further evidence of an increasingly hostile climate \u2014 and the need to adapt to it, fast. <br/>A global problem <br/>The pictures from Germany underscore the dangers that climate change poses even to the world's most advanced economies. While Europe has done more than most to attempt to mitigate the risks \u2014 the European Commission recently proposed the most ambitious package of climate measures yet by a major economy \u2014 these will not reverse changes that have already happened. Carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for about 100 years.  <br/>A certain amount of warming \u2014 and the extreme weather events associated with it \u2014 is already baked into our future making adaptation a necessity even if the Paris Agreement targets are met. Scientists warn that the recent floods and heatwaves are not the new normal, rather they herald the end of a stable climate. And without action, according to the World Bank, up to 132 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by climate change by 2030. <br/>These warnings must urge us into faster action, with more funding, to adapt and\u202ffind ways to work with the natural world rather than against it. <br/>By accelerating investment today, we can prevent billions \u2014 even trillions \u2014worth of economic damage and save many thousands of lives. A Global Commission on Adaptation report found that investing $1.8 trillion (\u20ac1.5 trillion) globally by 2030 in just five key areas, including climate-resilient infrastructure, such as\u202fstronger dams and drainage systems, and early warning systems could generate $7.1 trillion in total net benefits.  <br/>Some excellent climate-resilience projects already exist. In Germany, the new district of HafenCity within Hamburg is being built on raised plinths, lifting the whole area at least eight meters above sea level. In the Netherlands, engineers have been working on \"Room for the River,\" a program to widen and deepen the rivers Rhine, Meuse, Waal and IJssel to protect nearby cities and towns. Besides creating additional water channels, flood-prone buildings have been removed and additional storage basins created with farmers co-operating to allow agricultural areas to be flooded as required. <br/>In China, where floods have caused on average 251 billion ($38 billion, \u20ac33 billion) of damage annually in the decade to 2016, so-called sponge cities such as Xiangyang Han River Eco City now feature more water-absorbent areas including green roofs, fewer hard surfaces, and more efficient water channels and storage. <br/><br/>Sharing success <br/>On their own, however, these projects are not enough. One of the greatest challenges of climate adaptation is that responsibility spans many diverse authorities, at the local, regional and national level. <br/>Extreme heat, floods and storms also require precautionary planning and upfront investment in adaptation measures. <br/>This makes it imperative that we share successful strategies and transfer knowledge and solutions wherever appropriate. To understand the scale of action needed, as well as measure success, governments and the private sector must carry out climate vulnerability assessments and stress tests to evaluate the risk of damage from flooding and heat stress. They must incorporate the resulting data into planning and investments, and closely monitor progress toward greater resilience. <br/>We need to act fast. Gathering detailed knowledge will also allow us to better protect vulnerable groups, which usually suffer disproportionately more. <br/>These recent extreme weather events have shown that the climate emergency is an all-of-society and all-of-world problem. It is encouraging to read that the US and the EU are planning to increase their contributions to help developing countries fight climate change, but all developed countries must now deliver on their promise to jointly mobilize $100 billion a year in finance for both mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.  <br/>As the floods in Europe and China have shown, we need to accelerate adaptation efforts worldwide to ensure we are as well placed as possible to deal with whatever our newly unstable climate unleashes next. And we need to do it now. <br/>Ban Ki-moon is 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations.\u202fPatrick Verkooijen is CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation in Rotterdam. <br/></p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["In China, where floods have caused on average 251 billion ($38 billion, \u20ac33 billion) of damage annually in the decade to 2016, so-called sponge cities such as Xiangyang Han River Eco City now feature more water-absorbent areas including green roofs, fewer hard surfaces, and more efficient water channels and storage.

But even if further financing is pledged, they still face significant hurdles accessing the funds.Rich nations pledged more than a decade ago to pay $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries cut their own emissions and reduce the already-felt impacts of climate change. </p><p><br/>At the COP26 climate summit taking place in Glasgow, African negotiators want this financing for climate mitigation and adaption to be scaled up to $1.3 trillion per year by 2030. <br/>But even if the financing is upped, African nations may not stand to benefit much more than they are already. That's because they face huge hurdles accessing funds available through the Green Climate Fund (GCF). <br/>\"Many, many African countries are lamenting that they are not able to jump through the hoops [to access climate finance] because of the complexity and the technicality,\" Chukwumerije Okereke, an economist at Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike in Nigeria told Nature magazine in an October 2021 article. <br/>Because of this, the bulk of climate finance to date has gone to middle-income countries. <br/>Just 18% of GCF financing went to projects in the world's poorest countries, researchers from Scotland's Glasgow Caledonian University found in 2019, while 65% went to projects in middle-income countries like Mexico or India. <br/>Yet Africa often bear the brunt of climate events despite producing less less than 4% of the emissions responsible for climate change. <br/>How can countries access the Green Climate Fund? <br/>The Green Climate Fund is the single largest source of global climate finance today. <br/>To directly access GCF financing, a country has to first nominate a so-called \"national designated authority\". This is often an existing government department such as the treasury, which is the set up in Kenya, or the environment ministry, such as in Nigeria. <br/>The national designated authority acts as the interface between governments and the GCF and it's also the first point of contact in the country for any inquiries about the GCF. <br/>This step isn't too arduous, and 51 out of 55 African nations have designated a national authority since the GCF was established in 2015. <br/>Where's the problem then? <br/>It's the next step involving getting institutions accredited with the GCF that's proving a major stumbling block. <br/>These so-called \"accredited entities\" can include many different stakeholders, from public institutions to private companies and civil-society organizations. South Africa, for example, has two accredited entities, the Development Bank of South Africa and the South African National Biodiversity Institute.  <br/>The idea is that once accredited, these entities can directly apply to the GCF for climate financing. <br/>Having a wide variety of local stakeholders with direct access to the GCF is supposed to ensure that projects match local needs and also help GCF-funded projects fit in with a country's own national climate plans. <br/>\"This approach has opened the door to potentially a more equitable, efficient, and transformative use of climate funds,\" finds a March 2021 working paper by the World Resources Institute (WRI). <br/>But, the WRI paper criticizes, \"the high level of interest in the fund, combined with the GCF's current approach to facilitating access to funding, has led to bottlenecks and frustration for countries trying to access funding.\" <br/>And it's mainly African nations are missing out. Only 13 African countries have accredited entities, including Kenya, Namibia, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Senegal. <br/>Yet seven of the 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change are located in Africa, according to the African Development Bank. <br/>With limited expertise, less developed African nations struggle with the 67-page accreditation form, which requires a wide range of standards, including fiduciary compliance and anti-money laundering structures to environmental, social and gender policies and complaint mechanisms. <br/>Lack of direct control <br/>A further 25 African nations receive GCF funding for climate projects by using big intermediaries, such as regional development banks, the World Bank or UN agencies like UNDP. <br/>This lack of \"direct access\" to financing by African countries goes against a central premise of the GCF's formation. <br/>For climate adaptation expert Emmanuel Seck, the Program Director at Enda Energy in Senegal, it is also a wasted opportunity. <br/>\"We expect the Green Climate Fund to help us to build our institutions, to strengthen the governance of climate finance in our countries by enhancing the institutions,\" he said in a phone interview from Glasgow where he is attending the COP26 summit. <br/>\"So there is a lot to do in terms of building capacity for ourselves to gather the fund directly and not pass through an international organization.\" <br/>Running out of time <br/>Africa still fails to attract much GCF funding, Seck points out, even when going through international bodies.  <br/>\"The level [of financing] is very low if you look at the needs of [African] countries in terms of adaptation and in terms of mitigation,\" he said. <br/>Some African countries stand out, Seck said, such as Morocco which has received funding for 9 projects and Senegal, with 11 GCF projects. <br/>\"But if you look at other countries, we are not really well-prepared to access the climate fund,\" he said. <br/>Again, this comes often comes down to the lack of experience managing large-scale projects. <br/>\"We get access to micro-projects of between $10 to $50 million,\" Seck said. \"More than 60 million is a problem for our institutions.\" <br/>The Green Climate Fund offers financing through a so-called \"readiness program\" to help institutions prepare themselves for accreditation and writing funding proposals. <br/>\"The responsibility for African countries is is to use the readiness program to develop the capacity for our countries,\" Seck said, warning though that this \"may take time.\" <br/>With Africa experiencing a growing climate emergency with rising temperatures, droughts and destructive floods, many say time is running out. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The conference will be opened by the Hon. Hajia Alima Mahama, Minister of Local Government and Rural Development of Ghana. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on global warming confirms unequivocally that the implementation of the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will not be sufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 C. Sub-national actors are key to bridging the gap between national climate targets and the concrete action required on the ground. The Covenant of Mayors for Sub-Sahara Africa (CoM SSA) is an EU funded initiative that supports Sub-Saharan cities and municipalities to develop and implement sustainable climate and energy actions. This year, the CoM SSA is the headline initiative featured at the Climate Chance Summit Africa 2019. CoM SSA is the regional chapter of the Global Covenant of Mayors, the largest coalition of cities committed to local climate and energy action. \"The direct link that we (mayors) have with our citizens and the impact cities can have on people's daily lives make it one of the most relevant levels of action to fight climate change,\"  Mayor of Accra, Mr. Mohammed Adjei Sowah Launched in 2015 at the COP21, the CoM SSA is an initiative shaped by local governments to reflect the importance of climate and energy action at local level while highlighting the context and specificities of the Sub-Saharan region. More than 200 municipalities from 36 Sub-Saharan countries have made the political commitment to join the initiative and develop a long-term vision to tackle access to energy, climate mitigation and climate adaptation. The Conference of CoM SSA on 16 October will showcase key achievements and outcomes as well as provide lessons learnt from the cities engaged in the initiative over the last four years.

The conference will be opened by the Hon. Hajia Alima Mahama, Minister of Local Government and Rural Development of Ghana.  The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on global warming confirms unequivocally that the implementation of the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will not be sufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 C. Sub-national actors are key to bridging the gap between national climate targets and the concrete action required on the ground.  The Covenant of Mayors for Sub-Sahara Africa (CoM SSA) is an EU funded initiative that supports Sub-Saharan cities and municipalities to develop and implement sustainable climate and energy actions. This year, the CoM SSA is the headline initiative featured at the Climate Chance Summit Africa 2019. CoM SSA is the regional chapter of the Global Covenant of Mayors, the largest coalition of cities committed to local climate and energy action.  'The direct link that we (mayors) have with our citizens and the impact cities can have on people's daily lives make it one of the most relevant levels of action to fight climate change,' Mayor of Accra, Mr. Mohammed Adjei Sowah  Launched in 2015 at the COP21, the CoM SSA is an initiative shaped by local governments to reflect the importance of climate and energy action at local level while highlighting the context and specificities of the Sub-Saharan region. More than 200 municipalities from 36 Sub-Saharan countries have made the political commitment to join the initiative and develop a long-term vision to tackle access to energy, climate mitigation and climate adaptation.  The Conference of CoM SSA on 16 October will showcase key achievements and outcomes as well as provide lessons learnt from the cities engaged in the initiative over the last four years. From the 750 cities and municipality staff trained in the mapping of climate financing mechanisms accessible to local governments, the network of implementing partners, led by the Council of European Municipalities and Regions, will share its key results.

It wants policymakers to appreciate the economic worth of fragile coastal ecosystems.</p><p>Mangroves and coral reefs reduce erosion and soften the coastal impacts of extreme weather. This matters because climate change is making extreme weather more likely and many coasts are densely populated.</p><p>To what extent mangroves serve as shield against forceful waves and winds depends on several issues, including the depth of the water and the density of the vegetation. Mangroves may actually withstand the force of tsunamis. Coral reefs have a similar effect as low-crested breakwaters. They serve a protective function, for example, when cyclones cause waves to rise very high.</p><p>In 2010, the World Bank launched a global partnership called WAVE (Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystems Services). The idea was to ensure that natural capital is considered in development planning and is factored into national economic accounting. Many national statistical offices are aware of mangroves attracting tourists, but they tend to neglect services provided by ecosystems in regard to things such as coastal protection, fisheries enhancement and carbon storage.</p><p>In regard to coastal protection, there are several ways to assess the economic value of ecosystem services. The WAVE experts endorse an approach called \u201cExpected Damage Function\u201d, which insurance companies often apply too. This method takes account of every potential risk. It enables experts to compare the damages that accrue with and without a healthy natural habitat und the difference indicates what the ecosystem service is worth. According to the WAVE publication, this method makes more sense than the \u201cReplacement Cost\u201d approach, which is about estimating the value of mangroves and reefs by assessing the costs of building artificial infrastructure.</p><p>The WAVE authors argue that the better the benefits of ecosystem services are understood, the better those systems tend to be protected. Their publication offers the evidence of 20 case studies. They show that green infrastructure thrives where the local people are aware of the matter and raise political demands accordingly. Scientific evidence can be another trigger to protect eco systems.</p><p>The authors recommend several things:</p><p>\u2022 Mangroves and coral reefs must no longer be considered unconventional coastal protection. Their usefulness has been thoroughly researched.</p><p>\u2022 Data gaps concerning the coastal protection relevance of mangroves and reefs should be closed.</p><p>\u2022 Pilot studies would help to incorporate coastal protection services into national economic accounting.</p><p>\u2022 In many places, the cheapest option for coastal protection is to protect and nurture ecosystems.</p><p>\u2022 Where such systems have been damaged, restauration should be considered.</p><p>\u2022 Guidelines for protecting mangroves and reefs would be helpful, and so would international commitments to the cause.</p><p>\u2022 Developing countries should consider mangroves and reefs when drafting climate-adaptation plans, and donor governments should provide funds for related measures.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 32, "title": "The way forward", "published": "2017-03-31", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the situation seems quite grim, Bangladesh is not giving up. In fact, the country is often considered a climate-change adaptation champion. The government is committed to the cause.</p><p>Bangladesh is one of the nations that emits very little carbon, but it is likely to be among those that suffer most because of global warming. However, the country is not waiting to be rescued by others. It has taken several initiatives to facilitate climate-resilient development. In 2008, Bangladesh adopted a 10 year strategic action plan to address the impacts of climate change. Subsequently, a trust fund was created, which has so far invested the equivalent of almost $ 1 billion in tangible projects. The international donor community, moreover, has set up a parallel fund, which is called the Resilience Fund.</p><p>At the ground level, Bangladesh has achieved tremendous success in the area of disaster management. The country has a very effective cyclone warning system which is supported by nearly 50,000 cyclone preparedness volunteers. It also matters that the industrial sector has been growing, creating new livelihoods and boosting incomes opportunities. The constant economic growth over the past few years have set Bangladesh to graduate to a lower middle income country by 2021.</p><p>More needs to be done, of course. The following issues deserve attention:</p><p>\u2022 Measures should be taken to prevent further intrusion of salinity. It would be good to retain monsoon waters to increase the rivers\u2019 water flow in the dry season, so less saline water would be pressed into the delta. The technical challenges are great, however, and require thorough consideration.</p><p>\u2022 The existing coastal embankments have to be managed better. They need to be raised and made stronger as the sea level rises. Moreover, there should be provisions to repair damaged embankments fast.</p><p>\u2022 Agriculture provides livelihoods to most people in the coastal region, so climate-smart agriculture must be promoted. It would make sense, for instance, to rely on rice varieties that are especially salt-tolerant. The same can be said for other crops. Another option is cultivation on raised beds. Appropriate policies should promote interventions like this, ensuring that marginal farmers benefit.</p><p>\u2022 It is important to build disaster-resilient rural infrastructure, taking into account the needs of women and vulnerable groups.</p><p>\u2022 As rural to urban migration increases, appropriate urban planning and adequate urban infrastructure must be ensured. Moreover, livelihood opportunities must be created in new urban centres, so migrants will be attracted to other places than the crowded existing cities.</p><p>Apart from tackling challenges at home, Bangladesh must ensure in global negotiations that funding and technical expertise are provided to all countries that are vulnerable to climate change, especially if they have hardly contributed to the phenomenon. There are limits to what climate adaptation can achieve, moreover, so the international global community must protect the climate.

These sites are in distress due to rise in temperatures, melting glaciers, rise in sea level, severe drought and capricious wildfires.</p><p>The report says, \u201cClimate change is affecting world heritage sites across the globe\u201d. But it is not just heritage sites that are being affected but also coral reefs and other natural habitats.

Almost 27,000 delegates from over 190 nations had convened in Madrid this month to finalise the Paris Rulebook\u2014the manual that was supposed to guide the world on how to implement the objectives of the Paris Agreement when it comes into effect in 2020. Additionally, while there was no formal agenda to increase ambition, it was expected that nations would signal their intent to upgrade their 2020 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) ambitions. COP25, however, failed to deliver on both fronts. Dubbed as a \u2018disappointment\u2019 by the UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and an \u2018opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes\u2019 by climate activist Greta Thunberg, COP25 was unable to give much momentum to the Paris Agreement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outcomes on Key Issues</emphasis></p><p>Key issues that COP25 was expected to deliver on (which I have gone into more detail in my last article) included:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mitigation:</emphasis> The UN\u2019s 2019 Emission Gap Report launched around a week before the COP25 negotiations states that given the current greenhouse emissions trend, we are on track for 3 degree Celsius warming that would have devastating impacts on the fragile mountains, coastal ecosystems, communities and net global agricultural productivity. Even if the climate ambitions outlined in the current NDCs were to be met, according to the report, 2030 emissions will still be 38 percent higher than what is required to maintain temperature increase to 1.5 degree Celsius\u2014the threshold, identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), required to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change. Findings released from a global carbon budget study showed that emissions that need to go down by at least 7 percent annually for the next decade (to meet the 1.5 degrees goal) have actually risen up by 4 percent since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.</p><p>However, despite such alarming findings, World Resources Institute\u2019s 2020 NDC Tracker shows that only 80 countries (including Nepal) have stated their intentions to upgrade the ambitions on their 2020 NDCs. Most of these countries are developing or small countries that are only responsible for 10.5 percent of the global emissions. Major polluters did not make any pledges about ratcheting mitigation ambitions during the negotiations. COP25 did, however, conclude with a formal recognition to bridge the emissions gap through ambitious NDCs next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon Markets and Transparency:</emphasis> One of the mandates of this COP was to address and finalise outstanding implementation guidelines issues in the Paris Rulebook (most of which was completed in COP24). Guidelines for carbon markets and transparency were key issues of negotiations on this front.</p><p>Delegates were supposed to negotiate how carbon markets\u2014that enable nations to buy and sell carbon credits internationally\u2014were to be tracked, run and regulated. How to monitor, report and verify the implementation of NDCs was another key issue that required deliberation this year. However, despite the Paris Agreement coming into effect in 2020, delegates were unable to reach a consensus and these decisions have been pushed to next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Loss and Damage:</emphasis> Many countries and communities live in climate-sensitive ecosystems, and are continually impacted by the fast onset disaster events (like floods and landslides) or slow-onset events (like glacier melt and sea-level rise). No degree of adaptation will help avoid some forms of losses and damages to lives, livelihoods, property and culture brought on by these events. However, despite this, no dedicated financing mechanism has been allocated to address these impacts of climate change. The Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), which was established in 2013 to address such loss and damage, has mostly been used to understand the science behind these issues but has done little in the way of providing financial, technology and capacity-building support.</p><p>This year, at COP, the mandate of the WIM was set to be reviewed. And while an agreement was made to create an expert panel to \u2018support\u2019 loss and damage and what is being called a \u2018Santiago network\u2019 to facilitate technical support, no concrete agreement was made regarding new and additional sources of funding, despite repeated emphasis from the Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). There were also talks of redirecting such requests of loss and damage financing towards the Global Climate Fund (GCF), which does not only not have enough funds to cover its original purpose of providing mitigation and adaptation support but also has a lengthy procurement process which will make it useless during disasters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Finance:</emphasis> In addition to providing finance for loss and damage, climate finance needs to support low-carbon climate-resilient development and climate adaptation activities in low-income countries, according to the \u2018common but differentiated responsibility\u2019 principle of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, most of these financing needs are currently met through voluntary donor assistance which are niether reliable, nor enough. The goal to mobilise $100 billion by 2020 to meet climate financing needs of developing countries is also nowhere close to being met, with pledges still left hanging at the $10 billion mark.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So, what happened?</emphasis></p><p>Nations, this time around, failed to show the diplomacy and solidarity displayed during the 2015 Paris negotiations. Despite calls for immediate and coordinated global action, this year\u2019s COP was fraught with contention because of polluting nations like Brazil, China, India, Australia and the US who used technicalities to hold up progress on many issues.</p><p>Manjeet Dhakal, the Head of the LDC Support Team at Climate Analytics and an advisor to the LDC Chair, says that COP25 had some useful outcomes as it concluded with a formal call for more ambitious 2020 NDCs that close the emissions gap and because of the progress made on the loss and damage front (which could be strengthened during future negotiations). However, he says, \u2018many other aspects of the negotiations failed to materialize because of obstruction caused by some polluting nations who put individual greed before the collective good.\u2019</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Kathmandu Post (Nepal)</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["And while an agreement was made to create an expert panel to \u2018support\u2019 loss and damage and what is being called a \u2018Santiago network\u2019 to facilitate technical support, no concrete agreement was made regarding new and additional sources of funding, despite repeated emphasis from the Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

But they are trying to adapt.Teresa Hunter lives in Chuathbaluk, a Yup'ik village in the southwest of Alaska. The name means \"The Great Blueberry.\"Chuathbulak is a tiny village of less than 100 people that exists off the road system. </p><p>The only way to get there is by boat or plane in the summer, and by plane or driving on frozen rivers and the tundra during the winter. Like many rural Alaska Native communities, Chuathbulak doesn't have a hospital, and its two grocery stores mostly stock food that doesn't spoil because it has to be flown in. Fresh produce, like oranges or lettuce, is a rare treat. And food there typically costs four times as much as in the Lower 48 \u2014 which is what Alaskans call the rest of the US states except for Hawaii.Read more: Forest fires in Alaska: A ticking climate time bombThough some in the local population have swapped the traditional sod houses and dog teams for frame homes, snowmobiles, motorboats and all-terrain vehicles in recent decades, most still fish, hunt and forage for their food. Just as their ancestors did.Hunter is among them, and says the traditional way of life also helps keep her grocery bills low. But she is starting to notice climate change impacting a well-practiced routine. Summers are hotter, and winters are getting warmer. Hunter said in past years, the salmon would come up first through the Kuskokwim River in June and the berries would be ready for picking in August. But now the berries are ripening earlier, overlapping with the fishing season. That means people have to fish and harvest fruit at the same time in order to store enough food for the winter.\"It's a little difficult to do both at once,\" Hunter told DW. \"[You have to] worry about your fish and then [have to] think of your berries.\"Elders predicted climate changeThis summer's heat wave was another sign of climate change. It sent temperatures up to 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in early July \u2014 a first in places such as Alaska's biggest city, Anchorage. When Enakenty Sallison, who lives in Bethel, one of western Alaska's hub towns, went fishing during the spell of intense heat, he found dead salmon. \"I didn't know why they were dying until I read this article saying the heat wave was what was killing them,\" Sallison said.Following media reports of further sightings in a tributary of the Yukon River, north of Bethel, biologists from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the University of Alaska Fairbanks began to research the die-off. But some in western Alaska say climate change is not a surprise. Many have heard the elders passing down stories about climate change and how to prepare for it. Hunter remembers an elder coming to her school when she was a teenager and saying \"down states weather\" would come up here to Alaska.\"I wonder how he [knew] this stuff even though he couldn't read,\" she said. \"Sure enough, we're having the weather that he's talking about.\"She worries that the changing weather will make it harder for her grandchildren to fish and hunt, and that it will become even more challenging to travel in the winter as the ice freezes later and is no longer as thick. Read more: Alaska's sea ice loss means boom in polar bear tourismSearch and rescue groups, usually made up of volunteers from local villages, are already seeing the consequences of higher temperatures \u2014 2016 was the warmest winter on record for Alaska, and 2018 the second warmest. This year, four people died in the southwest of Alaska driving their snow machines into open water or falling through thin ice. Bethel Search and Rescue volunteer Mark Leary recovered some of the bodies.\"People are, they have to, [push] the envelope of safety so that they can start traveling by their own means,\" Leary said. He says airports are becoming ever more crowded as people turn to planes to get to bigger hubs, like Bethel, where they can find medical help or shop for groceries not available in the village stores. Thinning ice, shifting communitiesErosion is another big challenge in western Alaska, where most communities have been established near a river or on the Bering Sea coast, close to their main food source. Though erosion isn't new, as the ocean warms the sea ice that acts as coastal protection is weakening. And that means the shoreline is creeping closer to established villages. The thawing permafrost also destabilizes the ground beneath homes.Read more: Climate change: A village falls into the seaNewtok, a coastal village that's vulnerable to ocean storms, is already moving its 350 residents 14 kilometers (9 miles) away. The new location, called Mertarvik, is on Nelson Island, on higher ground and is built upon solid bedrock.South of Newtok, the village of Quinhagak is also facing erosion along its coastline and from the Kanektok River that runs through it.

It is even more worrying, that civil-society agencies are sounding the alarm about need spreading in about a dozen East and Central African countries without collapsed statehood being the reason. Masses require humanitarian aid as food security is dwindling in areas that are not haunted by the daily threat of violence. There are several, interrelated reasons, including the following:</p><p>For many months, draughts and floods have been destroying crops and devastating herds. Accordingly, there is less food, and incomes have been reduced. It is impossible to say that any single incident of weather is the direct result of climate change, but we know that climate change is making extreme weather more likely. We must assume that the phenomenon is contributing to the problems and should expect things to get worse if it continues.</p><p>In Africa, the population that needs to be fed is increasing fast. As a general rule, the average number of children a woman has is correlated to a country\u2019s level of prosperity.</p><p>The problems are compounded by pests destroying crops and infectious diseases affecting people as well as animals. The weaker an organism becomes, the less able it is to withstand.</p><p>In war zones, combatants use need and hunger strategically. They burn fields, kill herds and poison wells. They make it hard or even impossible for humanitarian agencies to deliver aid. Even when fighting stops, moreover, matters cannot improve fast due to the destruction of infrastructure and indispensable assets such as seed, for example.</p><p>Throughout history, armed struggle has meant deprivation. On the other hand, growing need makes violent action more likely as tensions concerning scarce resources intensify. When masses of people feel forced to leave their homes in search of new livelihoods, societies become less stable, and good governance becomes less likely.</p><p>Worsening food insecurity in various African countries is an issue of global relevance. In our interconnected world, a severe crisis in one world region concerns all world regions. Famine is evidently incompatible with eradicating hunger, the fist Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).</p><p>It is depressing that humanitarian agencies report that they need more money than is being made available.

But political parties need to focus on reducing pollution and reining in the environmental crisis, young people say.India's political parties are gearing up to woo voters for the general elections, which will begin on April 11. Nearly 900 million Indians are estimated to elect their representatives to the parliament's lower house, also known as the Lok Sabha.According to latest data from India's Election Commission, around 45 million people who have just turned 18, will be voting for the first time this year. This is a number which no political party can afford to ignore. </p><p>Apart from important issues like jobs and economic development, these young voters want good infrastructure and a better living environment.21-year old Nishtha Madaan, who is doing her Bachelors in English literature in Mumbai, wants politicians to give environmental issues their due importance.\"Anyone who thinks that people should have a good life, especially the young and the coming generations, should make environmental issues, including sustainability, their top priority. So if political parties are talking about development, that should not come at the cost of total disregard for the environment,\" Nishtha said.Stuti Mishra, who lives in the national capital, New Delhi, also expects political parties to address this issue. The 24-year old media professional said, \"Climate change has never received its due attention from Indian politicians. Even air pollution, which bothers the citizens of the national capital every year in the winter, remains an area-specific issue. Today the air quality index of most of our major cities are critically low. I don't think Indian voters vote with environment-related issues in their mind. But I hope in the future they will do that.\"What has the government done?Since assuming power in 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in New Delhi has shifted its focus to solar, wind and hydro-electric energy. As a result, the country is now the fifth-largest producer of energy using renewable sources in the world and also the fifth-largest producer of wind energy, according to a report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).In the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, India had committed to install 175 gigawatts of renewable power generators in the next seven years. Financial allocations for renewable energy were increased accordingly. According to Bloomberg NEF, India invested nearly 11 billion dollars in renewable energy sources in 2017.This shift to renewable energies is not only sustainable, but it also tackles the issue of pollution. India is the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world and air pollution levels are spiking across cities. It still relies on coal for three-fourths of its energy needs. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed 11 Indian cities as the most polluted cities in the world and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report noted that 620,000 premature deaths occured in India due to air pollution.Not On the AgendaExperts believe that the steps taken by the government are in the right direction, but are not enough. Leena Srivastava, Vice Chancellor of TERI School of Advanced Studies, said that New Delhi had set up a very ambitious programme to increase renewable energy capacity in the country and was also focused on energy efficiency improvements.\"We also see a major emphasis on moving to electric vehicles, although the infrastructure required to support electric-vehicle expansion will take a number of years and large investments,\" she told DW. \"I do believe that the government needs to do a little more in terms of climate adaptation action and in mobilizing communities and other stakeholders to become partners on the climate agenda,\" she added. Srivastava noted that there was a strong link between local problems like air pollution, solid waste management and water conservation and the environment, but no political party was willing to address the issue in the elections. \"The focus, unfortunately, remains on the more traditional issues like caste, community and security fears,\" she said.What needs to be doneA closer look at the 2014 election manifestoes of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC) shows that little or no emphasis was given to climate and environment. But this time, political parties have asked voters to suggest issues that they want leaders to address. But according to author and environmentalist Ananada Banerjee, this could be just another publicity stunt. \"On the 'government' front we have made all the right noises and posturing in global environmental summits, but when you look through the 'political party' lens there is practically nothing. Environment does not figure much as a political agenda.\"According to excperts, policies and measures taken by the government until now have lacked implementation and mindful consultation with researchers. They suggested that going forward, the government needed push the agenda of climate and environment closer home - in their electoral constituencies.Environmentalist Avlokita Shah, who closely works with the Aarey Conservation Group suggests, \"We need to encourage incentive-based participation from experts, professionals, scientists, environmentalists, ecologists and academicians who can add value by offering data-driven research that is scientific in nature. This will also offer a rather positive and a radical influence in our policy-making processes.\"Shah added that a lot of India's environmental policies were from colonial times and completely outdated. Furthermore, schools, colleges and institutions needed to actively start talking about climate change and environmental issues, she said. </p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["Leena Srivastava, Vice Chancellor of TERI School of Advanced Studies, said that New Delhi had set up a very ambitious programme to increase renewable energy capacity in the country and was also focused on energy efficiency improvements.

Subsequent research by the United Nations University-Institute for Environment and Human Safety (UNU-EHS) has found that this one particular event was responsible for inflicting overwhelming damages to crops, land, and homes\u2014losses that amounted to 14 times the average annual income of the affected subsistence households.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When climate change fueled extreme events causes death and property damage in wealthier populations, their insurance policies usually kick in, compensating people for some, if not most, of their losses. But what of poorer populations who cannot afford to pay yearly premiums? Who should compensate these people for the losses that occurred because of a global catastrophe they did not contribute to?</p><p>The Alliance of Small Island States (OASIS) first attempted to answer this question when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was being negotiated in 1991. They proposed the creation of an international insurance pool, that would compensate \u2018vulnerable small island and low-lying coastal developing countries for loss and damage arising from sea-level rise\u2019. It was proposed that each country\u2019s contribution to the pool would be contingent on its gross national product and global emissions. However, this proposal was rejected, and the subsequently produced UNFCCC document made no mention of Loss and Damage (L&amp;D), whatsoever.</p><p>Delayed Action</p><p>It was another sixteen years before the term Loss and Damage made an appearance in a UNFCCC document. Even then, upon insistence from polluting economies, L&amp;D was lumped under climate adaptation despite repeated protests from OASIS and Least Developed Countries (LDC) that L&amp;D was a distinct issue\u2014one that occurred when adaptative actions were simply not enough.</p><p>Eventually, in 2013, after decades of advocacy from vulnerable developing countries, the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (WIM) was established to address L&amp;D. While this text made no reference to liability and compensation, WIM\u2019s Executive Committee, however, did refer to insurance schemes as one of the main mechanisms to address L&amp;D. But this proposal had a cruel twist: In blatant disregard to UNFCCC\u2019s \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle, vulnerable developing nations were asked to, more or less, pay for their own insurance.</p><p>In the 2015 Paris Agreement, L&amp;D finally obtained its own separate article (indicating separation from the issue of adaptation), but only on the condition that the inclusion of L&amp;D did \u2018not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation\u2019.</p><p>L&amp;D contention</p><p>Over the years, developed countries have demonstrated relatively more willpower to finance mitigation and adaptation activities than they have with L&amp;D. In some ways, I see this reticence as a result of the fact that any contribution they make will be seen as compensation\u2014an acknowledgement that their emissions have created locked-in, destructive climate impacts that cannot be completely avoided, no matter how hard we try.</p><p>Another reason for this pushback though comes because the scope of L&amp;D is, in its current form, quite vast and hotly debated. The United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) defines L&amp;D as the \u2018the actual and/or potential manifestation of impacts associated with climate change in developing countries that negatively affect human and natural systems\u2019, This means that both extreme events (such as floods, landslides), as well as slow-onset events (such as rising sea levels), are relevant to the scope of L&amp;D. These calculations of loss and damage also include non-economic impacts. For example, in the Jure landslide, loss and damage calculations would not only take into account lost lives, land, and property but could also potentially take into account the effect on the mental and physical health of survivors, any sentimental or cultural losses, etc.</p><p>Recent progress</p><p>Despite many stalling efforts, L&amp;D gained significant momentum in the 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) last year, where countries had gathered to adopt rules to implement the Paris Agreement. Guidelines for vulnerable countries to report current and anticipated climate-related losses were established, along with space for them to report the actions taken and the assistance required to avoid, reduce or recuperate these losses. Additionally, it was also decided that these reports would be included in the Global Stocktake\u2014a process that takes place every five years to take stock of the global progress towards meeting the goals under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>While these new outcomes imply increasing responsibilities for polluting countries, it also means that vulnerable developing nations have much work ahead. Countries like Nepal need to be able to recognise and calculate L&amp;D associated with various short- and long-term climate impacts. Whether or how we are expected to conclusively link these impacts to climate change, however, remains unclear.</p><p>Tasks Ahead</p><p>When asked for feasible solutions, in the interviews conducted by the UNU-EHS researcher, the Jure landslide victims wanted the Nepali government to develop preventative measures to remove or reduce threats from such incidences and compensate victims when damages occur. As climate impacts increase, however, such compensation will become more and more impossible for small governments to cover by themselves and international assistance will become crucial. To ensure that this assistance comes, however, governments need to increase their own capacity for advocacy, research, and accountability.</p><p>Governments like Nepal need to invest more effort into L&amp;D calculations so that they are able to file claims in the international arena when the time comes. Any current research on the subject is being conducted mostly for academic purposes only. Additionally, knowledge and technology transfer to perform attribution research\u2014that establish causal linkages between any particular impact and climate change\u2014needs to be advocated for. Small governments also need to clean their own acts and create policies to ensure that, when the compensation arrives, they are able to distribute it in a transparent and accountable manner.</p><p>As the international community debates the scope of L&amp;D compensations, there is a need to ensure that UNFCCC\u2019s \u2018polluters pay\u2019 principle is strictly upheld. Polluting economies need to pay for the climate atrocities that their carbon emissions have fueled. This is the strongest hope for justice we have for climate victims like those of the Jure landslide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Kathmandu Post (Nepal)</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": ["However, this proposal was rejected, and the subsequently produced UNFCCC document made no mention of Loss and Damage (L&amp;D), whatsoever.

But unfortunately, despite national and international efforts, wetlands are still treated as revenue-generating machines or wastelands in many countries including Bangladesh. Apparently, nobody would like to think of wetlands as a natural solution in adapting to the global climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many people don't even bother to think that these ecosystems play a significant role in mitigating the adverse impacts of climatic change. Hence, many wetlands have already been encroached, degraded or polluted. The theme of this year's Wetlands Day is \"Wetlands and Climate Change\"\u2014and it has been chosen to highlight the important role played by wetlands, as a natural solution, in terms of adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change.</p><p>Many developing and developed countries, as well as their economies and natural ecosystems, have been battling with an unprecedented degree of climatic change in recent years. Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), prepared in 2008 and revised in 2009, identified that water security, food security, energy security, health security and livelihood security are being threatened by the adverse impacts of climate change.</p><p>As one of the lead authors of BCCSAP, I know that many of the 45 programmes included in this plan couldn't be implemented because of resource constraints, deficits in programme preparations and planning problems. This is quite unfortunate.</p><p>It should be noted that wetland ecosystems are severely affected, for example, by sea-level rise, coral bleaching, hydrological effects, changes in water temperature, and alterations in water availability and quality. Wetlands in Bangladesh, like in many other developing countries, are particularly affected by socio-economic pressures and the climate change, which result in the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and a concomitant negative impact on human communities, especially those on the coast.</p><p>The adverse impacts of climate change are particularly significant in our country and will decrease ecosystem resilience. Different reports suggest that around 90 per cent of the wetlands, hosting more than 70,000 water birds, are in the coastal region and under threat of submersion following a sea-level rise.</p><p>Many of our coastal, haor, dry and upland regions are likely to lose large numbers of wetland species as a result of climate change. Wetlands, particularly coastal and haor wetlands, are important in the process to mitigate climate change because they help to manage extreme weather events through the multiple services that they provide. Important wetland functions include water storage, groundwater recharge, storm protection, flood mitigation, shoreline stabilisation, erosion control, and retention of carbon, nutrients, sediments and pollutants (Dugan 1990).\u00a0</p><p>Experts say that wetlands are also significant carbon stores. According to the Ramsar Convention, it has been estimated that peatlands contain at least 550 Gt of carbon, which is almost double the amount stored in the world's forests. Although they cover only 3 per cent of the world's landmass, they contain 30 per cent of its soil carbon (Parish et al, 2008; FAO, 2012b). Wetlands such as mangroves like The Sundarbans, saltmarshes, haors and coral reefs play crucial roles in controlling flood peaks and spreading the water table. Thanks to their vegetation, such as trees and root mats, wetlands act as permeable barriers that slow waves, reduce flooding, and offer natural protection for coastlines against destructive weather events.</p><p>Wetlands are an important source of water everywhere, including in places where resources are scarce. Local populations and animal and plant species benefit from wetlands as providers of water. Wetlands allow water to reach the underground water table, making the resource available in dry periods.</p><p>Thus, wetlands are key for groundwater recharge and allow ecosystems to cope with drought in places like Barind Track. By the same process, by releasing underground water, wetlands help to maintain the flow of rivers when precipitations diminish. These enormously valuable natural bodies also offer solid evidence that investing in natural solutions is a cost-effective way to enhance resilience to climate change in vulnerable coastal areas and communities.</p><p>But with the degradation or encroachment of wetlands, human well-being is being compromised. It is raising the risk of flooding of houses and infrastructure and increasing the risk of exposure to water shortages and drought. Against these threats, initiatives to conserve wetlands can make a difference and benefit the well-being of the future generations of people and wildlife.</p><p>I think our policymakers should help raise public awareness of the importance of wetlands. They should ensure stakeholder participation in wetland management to maintain human well-being including livelihood. Strengthening national legal and policy arrangements to conserve all wetlands is an urgent task and that should be an integral part of Bangladesh's National Adaptation Plan (NAP) which should be prepared without any further delay.</p><p>I would also suggest developing and implementing NAP as per the NAP Roadmap prepared in 2015 and it should be our high priority along with revisiting Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Coastal, haor and unprotected wetlands are expected to be most severely impacted by climate change, but conserving and restoring the wetlands is an effective way to mitigate climate change impacts for people and biodiversity.

They also created a new funding body called the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to manage the funds, headquartered in Korea. The GCF has already received over USD 10 billion and has allocated some of it to a number of mitigation projects, as well as adaptation of infrastructure projects, but is yet to support any adaptation projects aimed at helping the poorest and most vulnerable communities in the least developed countries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the last board meeting of the GCF earlier this month, the board ended with an acrimonious decision to formally reject a proposal from Ethiopia for a USD 100 million programme, to support drought affected communities adapt to the adverse impacts. It was the first time the GCF board had formally rejected an adaptation proposal and the members were quite evenly split with developing country members supporting the project and some developed country opposing it on the grounds that it was more of a development project than a climate change one.\u00a0</p><p>Something similar happened at the previous GCF board meeting in regards to another proposal submitted by Bangladesh, through the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), to support communities and women in coastal Bangladesh with fresh drinking water to adapt to the salinity that they are already suffering from (although on that occasion the UNDP withdrew the project at the last minute so there was no formal rejection).\u00a0</p><p>The arguments and division between board members of developed and developing countries were almost identical.\u00a0</p><p>These two examples clearly demonstrate that the GCF, despite its laudable intentions to spend half their funds to support adaptation in the poorest and most vulnerable countries, is unable to deliver on this promise.\u00a0</p><p>It is, therefore, clearly time to go back to the drawing board.\u00a0</p><p>Without laying blame for this failure, I will make a few suggestions for ensuring the fulfilment of the objectives of providing adaptation funds to the poorest and most vulnerable communities in the poorest and most vulnerable countries.\u00a0</p><p>First, the GCF board needs to develop clear guidelines on what kind of adaptation proposals it will approve. Lack of clarity is a major cause for the failures we have already seen and is putting off others from applying.\u00a0</p><p>However, making clear theoretical distinctions between what is development and what is adaptation to climate change is far from easy. Hence, my own advice would be to use the board approved mechanism of enhanced direct access to allow countries to make project-by-project decisions at the national level and provide good guidance on how measurement, reporting and verification of the investments can be made (instead of trying to evaluate proposals on paper as they do now).\u00a0</p><p>Another aspect of the systemic failure is that the poorest and most vulnerable countries are not being able to access funds directly and have to apply through multilateral agencies such as the UNDP. This is penalising such countries from accessing the funds for adaptation directly. Allowing the countries to have enhanced direct access would also solve this bottleneck.\u00a0</p><p>Finally, developing countries preparing adaptation proposals also need to be mindful when making the case to show that the projects are, indeed, genuinely responding to adverse impacts of Climate Change and are not just development projects dressed up as climate adaptation ones.\u00a0</p><p>In conclusion, it is important for the GCF Board to pause and reflect on strategic changes right now, before proceeding as it has done so far, or else it will face more failures.

But the ride may stabilise and hurtle toward brighter vistas, potentially transforming the country\u2019s energy mix over the long term, industry experts said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, trouble seemed inevitable when, in June, the Chinese government slashed its subsidies for solar power and also halted all subsidies for utility-scale solar projects. It was a blow that plunged even the stocks of listed solar companies into a free fall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But sunny weather appears to be on the horizon for the industry, following the European Commission\u2019s announcement on Aug 31 that it is removing restrictions on sale of solar panels from China.</p><p>The EC curbs have been in place for almost five years. The European Union\u2019s antidumping and anti-subsidy measures on solar panels from China expired on Sept 3, the EC said in a statement. It was in the best interests of the EU as a whole for the measures to lapse, given the bloc\u2019s aim of increasing its supply of renewable energy, the EC further said.</p><p>The EU first imposed the measures in 2013. In March 2017, it extended them by 18 months. Chinese manufacturers were allowed to sell solar products in Europe free of duties only if they did so at or above a progressively declining minimum price. If they sold for less, they were subjected to duties of up to 64.9 per cent.</p><p>The removal of the minimum import price is good news for Chinese solar module manufacturers.</p><p>They will now be able to supply most of the EU\u2019s utility-scale power projects with solar panels produced in China, said Jiang Yali, a solar analyst at Bloomberg NEF, an industry information provider.</p><p>Alex Liu, who analyses China utilities, renewable energy and environmental services for UBS Securities, echoed her view. The EU\u2019s decision to scrap minimum import price restrictions on China would help facilitate Chinese solar exports to the EU market, and help lower solar product prices in the EU and stimulate demand, he said.</p><p>\u201cIt will promote faster solar grid parity in the EU leading to more unsubsidized solar projects, and the termination could also lead to the scrapping of Section 201 tariffs by the US on solar imports, as well as related tariffs in other countries.\u201d</p><p>Many domestic photovoltaic companies welcomed the EU\u2019s decision not to renew the restrictions but allow them to lapse on expiry. The move, they believe, will result in a win-win or mutual benefits.</p><p>Qian Jing, vice-president of Jinko-Solar Holding Co Ltd, the world\u2019s biggest solar panel producer by shipments, said the end of the restrictions will benefit the entire sector. \u201cThe world is flat,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a great example of trade liberalisation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolar panels, as an important clean energy product, play a significant role in coping with climate change, achieving emission cut targets for countries around the world.</p><p>\u201cThe original solar capacity overseas cannot meet the strong demand from the European and US markets, and if the domestic capacity can be offered to Europe, more overseas capacity can be released to satisfy the US market.\u201d</p><p>Beijing\u2019s decision to cut subsidies and impose a cap on new solar projects meant there was some 30 gigawatts of excess capacity to export.</p><p>However, there were few major markets to explore further given the tariffs imposed by the US and those planned by India, the second- and third-largest markets trailing China. The EU market thus meant a new door opened for domestic companies.</p><p>Qian\u2019s view is shared by Leon Chuang, global marketing director of Risen Energy. He estimated that the price of solar cells and modules is expected to fall slightly in the fourth quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2017.</p><p>\u201cConsidering the European market tends to be conservative and stable, the end of the EU\u2019s restrictions won\u2019t affect demand immediately but the demand in the European market is likely to be higher than the originally anticipated figure due to price cuts starting from next year,\u201d he said.</p><p>Bloomberg NEF, however, does not expect the EU move to have a marked effect on either global module prices or short-term demand in the EU.</p><p>In July, India imposed safeguard duties against PV cells and modules imported from China, Malaysia and developed countries, starting at 25 per cent this year, although these have been temporarily put on hold.</p><p>Meanwhile, some large manufacturers in China are still moving ahead with planned manufacturing expansions, according to Bloomberg NEF.</p><p>JinkoSolar, GCL-Poly and Tongwei are among those ramping up capacities, with JinkoSolar planning to raise cell capacity by 40 per cent and panels by 20 per cent by the end of this year, from levels seen in the second quarter, according to a financial results-related presentation in August.</p><p>According to Jiang, the MIP undertaking was largely unsuccessful as European manufacturers did not benefit from the anti-subsidy tariffs as expected. This year, there is very little manufacturing capacity left in Europe and Germany-based SolarWorld AG, the last major EU PV manufacturer, even filed for insolvency in early 2017.</p><p>China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce also described ending trade controls on Chinese solar panels as a successful model of resolving trade frictions through consultations, adding it will restore China-EU trade of solar panels to normal market conditions and provide a more stable and predictable business environment for both industries to realise win-win results.</p><p>These days, it is more important than ever to take steps toward dealing with climate change.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) was developed in response. CSA is now being promoted as a cultivation method among particularly vulnerable smallholder farmers in western Kenya. A team from the Centre for Rural Development (SLE Berlin) has researched what conditions must be in place for implementation to be successful.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Kenya, more than 60% of the people work in the agricultural sector, the majority as smallholders. Global warming is already causing extreme weather events \u2013 like heat waves, droughts and floods \u2013 more frequent and more intense. As a result, growing seasons and agro-ecological zones are shifting more and more. In Siaya and Kakamega, the counties under investigation in Kenya\u2019s western highlands, the proximity of Lake Victoria is further exacerbating the effects of climate change. Farmers in both counties produce maize, sorghum, millet, meat, dairy products and tea through rain-fed agriculture. Productivity in both counties lies way below its potential.</p><p>Making matters worse, the soils are overexploited due to inadequate management and continuous use without sufficient nutrient replenishment. Soil degradation is reducing the counties\u2019 already low agricultural productivity and threatening food security.</p><p>The situation presents a major challenge for Kenyan authorities, who are still struggling with devolution. In recent years, jurisdictions have been transferred from the national to the county authorities. However, several county authorities are not yet fully operational, and that reduces the scope for supporting sustainable development programmes.</p><p>Small farmers cannot take on soil protection and climate-change adaptation on their own. Moreover, Kenya\u2019s agricultural extension service lacks the necessary equipment and trained staff to develop appropriate strategies.</p><p>CSA implementation in Western Kenya</p><p>The SLE study was commissioned by the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) and was carried out in cooperation with GIZ Western Kenya and the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in Nairobi. The team focused on three priority research areas for the implementation of climate-smart agriculture (see box):</p><p>\u2022 Policies and frameworks;</p><p>\u2022 The farm-level perspective; and</p><p>\u2022 Forging links between research and practical application with help from the extension service.</p><p>The study clearly showed that county governments will have to act as catalysts in order to create the necessary environment for large-scale CSA implementation. Climate-smart agriculture must be integrated into key planning processes so it can receive financial support. Another goal is \u201csmart development\u201d, which makes use of synergies between different authorities. Issues such as food security, health and environmental protection must be considered in context.</p><p>The study also recommends to define the term \u201cclimate-smart agriculture\u201d in a coherent way for Kenyan usage. The international definition of CSA allows for a wide spectrum of technical alternatives. Kenya should therefore arrive at a consensus on what it will call \u201cclimate smart\u201d. A national forum could be convened in order to allow farmers, researchers, agricultural advisory services and administrators to develop a shared concept. Emphasis should be placed on cost-effective and flexible solutions that would allow fast responses to changing environmental conditions.</p><p>The notion of mitigation is particularly interesting. If it is disregarded, climate-smart agriculture looks very much like conventional climate adaptation in practice. On the other hand, payments could encourage carbon sequestration. Schemes that provide payments for ecosystem services (PES) can be useful. Another relevant ecosystem service is enriching the soil with organic matter or planting trees.</p><p>The challenge of implementation</p><p>The challenge of implementation is tremendous, though. Kenya\u2019s agricultural extension service has many shortcomings, so management has to improve, and more and better-trained employees need to be hired. The new staff must get appropriate pay, training and further vocational education. Improving the extension system is the task of the Ministry of Agriculture. It needs to create a stimulating environment and ensure that its teaching and training modules are up-to-date. A central platform should help to guarantee that uniform, standardised and up-to-date educational materials are used.</p><p>At the same time, a participatory approach is needed that involves farmers, the extension service and research institutions. The idea is to ensure that farmers and advisers have opportunities beyond only expressing opinions on cultivation methods. They must be empowered to contribute significantly to development.</p><p>Once the extension service is better equipped to reach and advise farmers, the latter will be in a better position to make good decisions on climate-smart agriculture. Doing so will require a thorough and appropriate transfer of information to guide farmers through the entire process. At the same time, model farms, farmer-to-farmer exchanges and other measures should ensure the information is spread.</p><p>Structural barriers</p><p>However, there are also barriers that are structural in nature. They include unfavourable market conditions, political and institutional barriers, a lack of infrastructure \u2014 including information and communications technology \u2014 and poor service quality. Comprehensive policies and impact monitoring are indispensable for a successful large-scale implementation of CSA.</p><p>Moreover, farmers have no guarantee that their farms will be sufficiently resilient against future climate changes even if they take climate-smart approaches. Additional safety nets are needed, including subsidised meteorological services, insurance against crop failure as well as income loss and measures to support farmers until they see a return on their investment.</p><p>In sum, implementing climate-smart agriculture is a complex undertaking. The advantage is that this holistic approach can build resilience among large segments of the population and improve the standard of living in rural areas.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Emphasis should be placed on cost-effective and flexible solutions that would allow fast responses to changing environmental conditions.

Future climate summits must resolve this issue. Global action hinges on it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2009, the UN climate summit in Copenhagen famously failed to agree on a comprehensive agreement. Instead, a rudimentary Copenhagen Accord was adopted. It included a commitment of the industrialised nations to jointly mobilise '100 billion dollar per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries'. This funding was to come from a 'wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance.' Obviously, the provision of adequate climate finance is also a pillar of the Paris Agreement, the conclusive contract concluded in 2015 to keep global warming below two degrees at most and preferably below 1.5 degrees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moreover, the Copenhagen summit decided that a significant share of adaptation funding was supposed to be delivered through a new Green Climate Fund (GCF), the governance structure of which would provide for equal representation of developed and developing countries. One year shy of the 2020 deadline, two questions arise:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What progress have developed countries made in fulfilling their promise?</p><p>What role does the GCF play in channelling those financial flows?</p><p>There is no straightforward answer to the first question. Ten years after Copenhagen, we still do not have a commonly agreed definition of what counts as climate finance. Nor is there an agreement on how much of the $?100 billion per year should come from public sources rather than private ones.</p><p>The latest climate summit in Katowice in December 2018 discussed two climate finance reports. One was prepared by the Standing Committee on Finance of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the other was prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an organisation of high-income countries. Both documents are useful, but the information they provide does not add up to an entirely conclusive picture.</p><p>The good news is that both reports give some evidence of climate finance increasing, potentially even fast enough to reach the sum of $?100 billion next year. At the same time, they show that the flows nonetheless fall woefully short of what was promised, let alone what is needed.</p><p>The UNFCCC report was drafted as the latest in a series of biannual assessments of public climate-finance flows from developed to developing countries. It covered the years 2015 and 2016, stating that such flows increased 30?% in those two year, reaching $?55.7 billion in 2016. The OECD report assessed public climate-finance flows from 2013 to 2017. According to it, there was a 44?% increase in that period, with funding rising to $?56.7 billion in 2017.</p><p>Both reports show that donor governments still overwhelmingly prioritise funding the reduction of emissions over building resilience in recipient countries. A mere quarter of public flows serve adaptation purposes.</p><p>Unfortunately, the reports do not tell the full story because they shy away from many relevant issues:</p><p>They do not assess to what extent climate finance is provided on top of official development assistance (ODA). Such 'additionality' was promised in Copenhagen.</p><p>The reports do not deal with the predictability of funding. Predictability is essential for facilitating the policy ownership of developing countries.</p><p>While they do show whether public funding was delivered in the form of loans or grants and that loans are still the lion share of the money delivered, neither report lists the (lower) grant equivalent value.</p><p>The reports do not elaborate what kind of climate finance is adequate. Should adaptation support occur in the form of grants or loans? Should adaptation funding be even more prioritised for least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS)? They have done the least to bring about climate change, but suffer the worst impacts. Is it legitimate to include as public climate finance money from export credit agencies, even though it is geared to generating income in donor countries? The OECD report does so. And what about the gender dimensions of climate finance? Only the UNFCCC has begun to consider this matter in its climate-finance reporting.</p><p>At the Katowice summit last year, developing countries wanted a comprehensive climate-finance accountability package to be adopted. It would have obligated rich nations to state in advance what funding they would make available. It would also have introduced a clear reporting procedure to check to what extent they lived up to the advance pledges. However, the developed countries rejected any attempts to define climate finance more precisely. They even refused to use common reporting time frames.</p><p>The reporting guidelines approved in Katowice are thus too vague. They allow developed countries to count an almost unlimited list of financial flows as climate finance. They can even include non-financial efforts, in the fields of capacity building and technology transfer, for example.</p><p>The current scenario is exasperating. It is impossible to precisely assess whether the $?100 billion pledge will be fulfilled next year. Moreover, 2020 is also the year by which parties to the Paris Agreement are supposed to increase the ambition of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to climate protection. Commitments must be stepped up considerably to achieve the goals. However, many developing countries have stated that more ambitious action on their part will depend on increased support from developed ones.</p><p>By 2025, moreover, a new target for global climate finance is to be set, and the consensus is that it must exceed $?100 billion. Developing countries insist on a new collective goal, based on joint deliberation and in tune with their needs. No doubt, the international community needs a clear definition of what climate finance is - and how much money developed country governments must make available. Since Copenhagen, ambiguity has clouded accountability - and that must change. Future climate summits must resolve this issue.</p><p>Prioritise the Green Climate Fund</p><p>The second major climate-finance controversy concerns the role of the Green Climate Fund. It is technically the largest multilateral climate fund and the newest addition to the global climate-finance architecture. It was established in the context of the UNFCCC and reports directly to UNFCCC summits. Developing countries overwhelmingly regard the GCF as the primary multilateral channel for supporting climate action under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>So far, governments of high-income countries have pledged $?10.3 billion to the GCF. The sum includes $?3 billion from the USA, of which $?1 billion was already paid, while nobody expects the administration of President Donald Trump to transfer the remaining $?2 billion. It is far from certain that other high-income countries are willing to make up the shortfall as developing countries demand. But even if the money was contributed, the GCF's financial clout would obviously remain quite modest. After all, trillions of dollars are needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The GCF is important nonetheless. By March 2019, it had 84 implementing partners, including multilateral development banks, UN agencies, bilateral institutions as well as multinational private sector banks. The majority of implementing partners (49) are regional and national institutions from developing countries, but, so far, the multilateral development banks received the lion's share. The GCF has so far approved 102 projects worth $?5 million, of which the so-called 'international access entities' got 84?%.</p><p>Quite obviously, that share is much too big for promoting the policy ownership of developing countries. Country ownership, however, is a core principle of the GCF. On the upside, GCF cooperation with national-level institutions has been promising. The crucial element is that national agencies must approve all projects, can submit proposals and elaborate country programmes.</p><p>From the perspective of developing countries, the GCF has several other advantages:</p><p>Developed and developing countries have equal representation on the 24 member board, and seats are reserved for LDCs and SIDS.</p><p>The GCF is unambiguously committed to sustainability.</p><p>It recognises that its funding must serve multiple purposes beyond climate action - such as poverty alleviation, broader environmental protection and gender equity, for example.</p><p>It commits 50?% of funding (in grant equivalent terms) for climate adaptation and also reserves half of its adaptation funding for SIDS, African states and LDCs.</p><p>Contributors to the fund cannot earmark funding, which is how governments of high-income countries are increasingly remote-controlling multilateral agencies.</p><p>The GCF has an important role to play, so it is frustrating that its long-term future is not guaranteed. It urgently needs more money. Not least in view of US obstruction, it is unlikely that the first formal replenishment round will be generous. The GCF will hold a pledging conference in early November, shortly before the next UN climate summit in Santiago de Chile. Norway and Germany have set a good example by announcing that they will double their contributions. Indeed, if contributor country governments want to prove to developing countries and emerging markets that they are serious about climate action, they must ensure that the GCF gets at least twice the $?10.3 billion that they pledged in the first round.</p><p>Liane Schalatek works for the Washington office of the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Stiftung, which is close to Germany's Green Party.
