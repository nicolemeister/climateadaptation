In  2024, Eramet's  economic  contribution  will  amount  to  2.7bnEUR in  all the territories in which it operates. Local purchases account for two-thirds of this contribution,  and  salaries  for  around  one-sixth.  Taxes paid in the Group's various operating territories amounted to 441 MEUR in 2024. 16.2 MEUR of community investment and sponsorship, a historic figure Community  investment for the benefit of  local populations has doubled compared to  the previous  year, reaching  the historic  figure of  16.2 MEUR in 2024. This amount,  mainly driven by actions in  Gabon (where investment amounted to 9 MEUR), benefited  260,000 people in all territories where the Group operates. Women and young people are the priority target groups for Eramet's social initiatives This  amount  includes  all  contributory  and  corporate  philanthropy expenses incurred  by  companies  in  which  Eramet  is  a shareholder. In particular, it includes the 11 projects deployed over 2 years as part of the \"Eramet Beyond for Contributive  Impacts\"  sponsorship  program,  which  is  part  of  the \"Act for Positive  Mining\"  CSR  roadmap.  These  initiatives,  which  are  distinct from economic  contributions,  complement  and  amplify  the  Group's societal impact beyond its industrial activities, in the regions concerned. Eramet  is also publishing today its annual report on payments to governments in territories  where Group subsidiaries are active in the extractive industry(1) , drawn up in accordance with EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) methods.  This  \"Report  on  the  Group's  financial  transparency  at  December 31, 2024\" is  available  on  the  Group's  website.

In  2024, we strengthened  this commitment through  high social impact  projects, designed in partnership  with  local  stakeholders,  to  better  meet  the  needs  of  local populations.  This commitment is a  pillar of our \"Act  for Positive Mining\" CSR roadmap.  It  reflects  our  determination  to  provide concrete support for the economic  and  social  dynamics  that  are  shaping  the future of the towns and countries where we operate.\"             Breakdown of economic contribution by area of operation Record economic and social contribution in Gabon Present  in Gabon through its subsidiaries  Comilog (manganese mining in Moanda) and  Setrag (rail  transport), Eramet  is the  world's leading producer of high- grade  manganese ore. In 2024, the Group's  economic contribution in the country will  amount to  753.3 MEUR, including  382.3 MEUR of  local purchases,  151.5 MEUR of payroll for 10,462 direct jobs(2) (98.9% of which in the local area), and 210.5 MEUR of taxes paid to the State. Community  investment and  sponsorship reached  an all-time  high of  over 9 MEUR, benefiting  more than 157,000 people. These resources  have been used to improve local  infrastructure, notably by rehabilitating 12 km of roads (more than 20 km since 2020), installing almost 1,900 streetlamps, equipping 2,200 schoolchildren with teaching materials, and extending the Moanda market. Two  structuring projects  have been  financed in  Moanda via  the CSR  Fund co- managed  with  the  Gabonese  government:  the  renovation  of  the departmental hospital,   which   will  benefit  the  population  of  Moanda  (around  70,000 inhabitants), and the construction of a high school of excellence. In  Gabon, the  \"Eramet Beyond  for Contributive  Impacts\" program  embodies the Group's  commitment to supporting the  region's economic and social development. In  2024, five  structuring  projects  were  deployed.  Among  them, the \"Femmes d'Avenir\"  program  supported  more  than  350 women  entrepreneurs, creating or consolidating  276 jobs, while  \"Lire pour  l'Avenir\" gave  more than 4,500 high school students access to digital educational resources. Senegal: Oasis du S\\xE9n\\xE9gal, a large-scale tourism development project In  2024, the total economic  contribution of the  Eramet Grande C\\xF4te subsidiary will amount to 185.4 MEUR, including 107.5 MEUR of local purchases, 42.4 MEUR of taxes paid,  34 MEUR of payroll and 2,526 direct (jobs2 ), 99.3% of which will come from the local area. Community  actions have benefited more than 20,000 people, thanks to programs in the  fields of health, market gardening and  training. They are in line with the Group's  strategy  of  contributing  to  the  emergence of self-sufficient local industries. Corporate philanthropy initiatives have benefited over 2,000 people. Community  investment and patronage totaled  1.5 MEUR, benefiting 22,610 people in all. Key initiatives included   * Support for local health posts, resulting in 13,000 medical consultations.   * Support for 1,500 market gardeners, through the distribution of 57 tonnes of     agricultural inputs and 882 batches of seeds.   * Support for 6,000 people, including 500 working women, through economic     interest groups (EIGs). Focus  on patronage  in Senegal:  two structuring  projects supported  by Eramet Beyond In  2024, as part of  its \"Eramet Beyond  for Contributive Impacts\" program, the Group launched two major initiatives in Senegal:   * Femmes d'Avenir S\\xE9n\\xE9gal, in partnership with Women in Africa Philanthropy,     has enabled 178 women entrepreneurs to strengthen their skills in the Dakar     and Thi\\xE8s regions, helping to support 1,749 indirect jobs.   * BUILD (Beyond Uniting Initiatives for Louga's Development), deployed in the     Louga region, supports the development of agricultural, fisheries and     livestock sectors. By 2024, 183 people had already benefited from targeted     training in three rural communes. Eramet  Grande C\\xF4te  has also  completed a  major tourism development project in Senegal,  with the  creation of  the \"Oasis  du S\\xE9n\\xE9gal\"  in the  Darou Khoudoss commune,  near  Diogo.  Driven  by  a  desire  for  territorial  enhancement and sustainable local development, this project has mobilized a voluntary investment of nearly 3 MEUR. Conceived  as an  ecological, tourist  and social  space, the  Oasis covers 544 hectares and includes a landscaped area of 2,000 m\\xB2, a plantation of over 1,000 palm  trees, relaxation facilities  and several water  points. The first tourist operator  to set up a  shop here opened its  doors in January 2025. In this way, L'Oasis du S\\xE9n\\xE9gal is helping to boost the region's economic and tourist appeal, while offering local communities a place to live and play In Argentina: supporting training and facilitating access to education In 2024 the completion of construction and start-up of production at the Group's Argentinian  subsidiary, which  specializes in  lithium production,  generated a total  economic contribution  of 256.4 MEUR.  It paid  9 MEUR in  taxes and injected 219.7 MEUR  into  the  local  economy  through  purchases  and subcontracting. The payroll  amounted to 27.5 MEUR  for 3,169 direct (jobs2  ), 99.1% of which were in the  local area,  confirming the  Centenario plant's  local roots right from the construction phase. Eramine  counts over 5,800 beneficiaries of community projects deployed in eight localities  between Salta and  the Centenario industrial  site. The economic and social  investment made  - including  sponsorship initiatives  - amounts to more than 223,000EUR In  terms  of  cultural  events  4,980 people  received  support. In the area of health,  a  program  was  launched  in  Santa  Rosa  de  los  Pastos  Grandes in partnership  with the provincial  Ministry of Health  and Fundaci\\xF3n Por Nuestros Ni\\xF1os.  The program offers consultations in  five medical specialties, with 641 consultations carried out. Children accounted for 51% of beneficiaries. In  Indonesia: a  local development  program focusing  on education,  health and economic diversification In Indonesia, the Eramet Group, via its minority stake in the PT Weda Bay Nickel joint  venture, generated a local economic contribution of almost 427.4 MEUR(3) in 2024. The  company paid 155.9 MEUR(3)  in taxes, mobilized  257 MEUR(3) in purchases and  subcontracting,  and  paid  10.8 MEUR(3)  in  payroll  PT  Weda  Bay Nickel's activities created 16,784 direct jobs(2).

In  the  health  sector,  equipment  has been supplied to several medical facilities, including the Maba regional hospital. Beyond  this economic impact, Eramet Indonesia  has deployed a local development program  structured around four pillars  - infrastructure, education, health and economic   diversification  -  benefiting  more  than  61,000 people.  Community investment and sponsorship amounted to almostEUR 3 4 million over the year. As  part of its \"Eramet Beyond  for Contributive Impacts\" corporate philanthropy program,  the  Eramet  Group  is  developing  two  complementary  initiatives in Indonesia:   a   scholarship  program,  in  partnership  with  the  Kitong  Bisa Foundation,  which supports 42 students from  the country's eastern provinces in their  higher  education,  and  an  agroforestry project, currently under study, aimed  at structuring a  sustainable nutmeg production  chain for the benefit of 300 small-scale farmers by 2026. In  Norway,  Eramet  Norway  continues  its  commitment  to local communities by supporting  local cultural and sporting initiatives  in the Kvinesdal region. In 2024, this  community  investment  amounted  to  195,000EUR, benefiting  more than 10,000 people in the region. The  Group's economic contribution in the country amounts to almost 292 MEUR. This includes  228.9 MEUR in local purchases, 4.9 MEUR in taxes and duties, and a payroll of 58.1 MEUR for 738 direct jobs(2 ), most of which are filled locally. In  the United States, the subsidiary Eramet Marietta Inc (EMI) made an economic contribution  of  over  118 MEUR  in  2024. The  company  paid  523,000EUR in taxes, incurred  97.9 MEUR in purchases  and subcontracting, and  paid 19.5 MEUR in payroll for 195 direct jobs(2 ), 97.9% of which were in the local area. At  the same time, EMI  supported local health and  education initiatives to the tune  of 33,000EUR. This  support has  enabled 60 people  with reduced mobility to access  necessary  medical  care,  and  three  students  to  benefit from school scholarships. In France, Eramet's economic contribution amounted to more than 273 MEUR in 2024. The  Group paid 5.2 MEUR  in taxes, 138.6 MEUR  in purchases and subcontracting, and 128.4 MEUR in payroll for a total workforce of 781. As part of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Eramet also launched the Eramet  Olympic  Challenge,  a  solidarity  challenge that mobilized nearly 400 employees.  This  initiative  raised  10,000EUR for  the  \"Sport  dans  la  ville\" association, which supports young people in difficulty. In New Caledonia, Eramet was able to maintain an economic contribution of 369.6 MEUR,  in  a  complex  political  and  social context. These contributions include 221.2 MEUR in local purchases, 135.6 MEUR in payroll for 2,676 direct (jobs2 )(91.9% local)  and 12.6 MEUR in taxes paid. Community investment, amounting to 154,000EUR, has  focused on emergency health care,  access to water, educational support and integration  projects  benefiting  more  than  1,500 people.  In 2024, 168 young people benefited from the Eramet Beyond scholarship program. In Cameroon, after four years of field studies, the Group decided not to develop a  mining project,  due to  environmental and  economic considerations. However, Eramet  wanted to leave a positive contribution to the country, so it decided to invest  in a  different way,  in the  service of  local development. In 2024, in partnership  with ClassM,  the Group  launched a  project to  set up  a plantain banana  buying group to support the  agricultural sector and create new economic prospects for local producers. The  first  sales  were  made  in  2024. 145 plantain growers were trained in 9 villages,  and 61 of  them became  regular suppliers  to the  central purchasing office. The purchasing center, called Terre d'Ako, employs 5 full-time staff.

These sacred forests are often the last remaining fragments of natural vegetation in regions that have otherwise been degraded by extensive land use. They serve as refuges for native plant and animal species and preserve a biodiversity that would be endangered without them.</p><p>Many local farmers remember that their landscapes were once forested in their childhood - a sign of the dramatic environmental changes of recent decades. The degradation of soils is largely due to rapid population growth and the expansion of agriculture to meet food needs in areas that are often characterised by food insecurity. In addition, there is little awareness of sustainable land and forest management.</p><p>The church forests have survived mainly because of the spiritual values that the EOTC and its followers attach to them. Believers regard all elements in a church forest - trees, shrubs, grass, water, animals - as sacred. This reverence has also fostered the way of life of the monastic communities that live in many of these forests and use sustainable practices rooted in religious teachings. Although these communities rely on the forest for their basic needs, they use its resources with restraint and respect, committing themselves to living in harmony with the environment.</p><p>This approach is a unique model for nature conservation and a complement to conventional forest management, interweaving ecological sustainability with spiritual and cultural practices.</p><p>Employment, timber, biodiversity</p><p>In cooperation with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church Development and Inter-Church Aid Commission (EOC-DICAC) and Bread for the World, a project has been developed to support communities in the restoration and conservation of such forest landscapes. The joint project is called the 'Sustainable Church Forest Management Program' (SCFMP).</p><p>The restored forests will provide employment, timber and firewood and improve biodiversity and soil fertility in the long term. The trees also bind carbon dioxide and reduce the effects of climate change. Due to EOC-DICAC's close relationships with local communities and their administrations at village and district level, the programme has already extended its approaches to the surrounding landscapes. EOC-DICAC also collaborates with research institutions and relevant government agencies.</p><p>However, some church forests are not clearly demarcated, which can lead to a conflict of interest between the monasteries and the surrounding communities over church resources. To mitigate this risk, the EOC-DICAC will continue the dialogue between the different stakeholders by involving church and community leaders from the beginning to achieve a common understanding of the importance of protecting church forests.</p><p>Reforestation measures</p><p>At the heart of the programme are reforestation measures, especially for those who depend on the natural resources extracted from the church forests. It takes two main approaches:</p><p>1. Green Corridors - connecting nature and people:</p><p>To protect church forests, EOC-\u00adDICAC's green corridors concept supports communities living outside the forests to establish a sustainable connection with monastic communities living in the forests. Isolated patches of forest or natural habitats are connected to extensions of land of different sizes and shapes to enable the migration and dispersal of plant and animal species. Green corridors can be planned in different sizes and lengths. They can be established at regional, sub-regional and local levels. The concept provides an evaluation system for planning the corridor structures that are most suitable in terms of conservation and connectivity. These corridors play a crucial role in the restoration and upscaling of landscapes.</p><p>2. Agroforestry - a key to sustainable food security:</p><p>Various combinations of trees, crops and vegetables can be grown in the tree plantations and on the farmland between the villages and the church forests. Within the plantations, the trees can add several positive ecosystem services to this integrated agricultural concept:</p><p>high food and nutrient diversity that is available longer into the year,</p><p>lower risks compared to monocultures in terms of negative effects of weather and pests,</p><p>raising the water table and reducing overland or surface runoff by creating drainage through roots,</p><p>providing shade and reducing the evaporation of groundwater,</p><p>fertilisation through nitrogen fixation and mulch formation through falling leaves,</p><p>reducing soil erosion.</p><p>With these approaches, the SCFMP aims to fundamentally improve food security in the respective regions. It has reduced the number of days of hunger, increased crop yields and improved dietary diversity through the cultivation of fruit and vegetables.</p><p>It also helps to increase income by promoting sustainable agricultural practices and teaching entrepreneurial skills. It has further promoted a culture of saving. The programme focuses on women and youth by involving local women's groups and young people who have no prospect of owning their own land in all economic activities and in the establishment of the green corridors.</p><p>In addition, the corridors and other activities are restoring and preserving ecosystems and degraded areas. They also increase the density and biodiversity of church forests. Other benefits include the reduction of water-borne diseases and the improvement of local communities' knowledge, awareness and skills in forestry and conservation.</p><p>Preserved through religious reverence</p><p>Ethiopia's church forests are an exceptional part of both Ethiopia's spiritual heritage and the national Green Legacy Initiative, which is part of the country's multi-layered response to the impacts of climate change. What makes these forests special is that they are protected not only by ecological intentions but also by a deep-rooted religious reverence, giving them a unique conservation status and framework rarely found in other conservation efforts.</p><p>Awareness and a sense of shared responsibility are crucial for the sustainable management and protection of these vital natural resources. The EOTC plays a critical role here, taking an eco-theological approach that combines traditional conservation knowledge with insights from ongoing ecological and sustainability programmes. To strengthen this stewardship, the programme partners are committed to ensuring that the EOTC obtains full ownership of the church forests so that it can effectively continue its sustainable management and conservation practices.</p><p>With the SCFMP, Bread for the World is also tapping into important indigenous knowledge about the use of natural resources. This is the basis for the programme's enormous potential to protect as many of Ethiopia's church forests as possible. Strong institutional partnerships with church organisations such as EOC-DICAC and local and international partners help to promote environmental protection throughout the country and beyond. This comprehensive approach not only improves environmental protection, but also promotes peaceful coexistence and a shared commitment to Ethiopia's natural heritage. The church forests are an example of how spiritual values and sustainability efforts can be aligned to protect ecosystems and provide a model for community-centred, eco-theological conservation efforts.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["These corridors play a crucial role in the restoration and upscaling of landscapes. 2.

These include the skyrocketing of prices of inputs like quality seeds, pesticides and fertilisers. The hardship has pushed farmers to adopt new crops such as maize, soybeans and cassava. For smallholders like Mbewe who has been farming tobacco for the past two decades, change was hard but inevitable.</p><p>'Things are now easier,' he says. 'For example, the fertilisers we are using are more affordable compared to what we used in farming tobacco. I was only farming 20 out of 100 hectares, because I could not afford to buy tobacco fertiliser for the whole land.'</p><p>Moreover, the tobacco is very labour intensive.

The project is scheduled to run for two years. The budget is co-financed to 75 % by donors and to 25 % by the members of the consortium.</p><p>The region is suitable for agriculture, livestock farming and fishing and has abundant water and forest resources. Nevertheless, the communities are chronically affected by food insecurity.</p><p>One of the main causes is subsistence monocultures with very low production. The lack of sustainable agricultural practices such as soil and water conservation, soil fertility management, moisture retention, agroforestry and crop diversification are further reasons for the low agricultural productivity.</p><p>Fishing is a major source of income, but little fish is produced each year as there is no access to fishing gear, markets and transportation. In addition, the catch is poorly processed and can only be sold for a low price.</p><p>Intercommunal conflict</p><p>Gambela is characterised by ethnic diversity and has a long history of inter-communal conflicts. Since the outbreak of the civil war in South Sudan in 2013, many South Sudanese refugees have also been living in Ethiopia. Gambela has a total population of 436,000 people. In addition, according to the UNHCR, 387,155 refugees currently reside in Gambela. The majority of these refugees are Nuer. </p><p>With their large numbers, they have changed the ethnic structure in the region. This has further fuelled ethnic conflicts, especially between the two largest groups, Anyuak and Nuer. There are also conflicts over resources between the host communities and the refugees. Plastic waste, especially in refugee camps and cities, is furthermore affecting natural resources such as water.</p><p>Women and girls are most affected by conflicts and poor living conditions. They face multiple burdens from food production, child and household care and are exposed to various forms of violence, especially gender-based violence (GBV). High unemployment is another challenge for the communities. </p><p>The unemployed youth are prone to risky migration and are an easy target for recruitment by armed groups.</p><p>Ethiopia has adopted a comprehensive refugee response framework to facilitate the implementation of policies for refugees outside camps, elementary school enrolment, work permits, provision of irrigable land and local integration. These measures need to strike a balance between the above mentioned framework and local, regional and national policies for the development of the entire region, which is even more difficult when resources are scarce. The main problem is that host communities feel excluded from the economic and social benefits that refugees receive.</p><p>The consortium's project combines peace with development and humanitarian aid by promoting dialogue between communities in order to achieve peaceful coexistence between different ethnic groups and with refugees. It also focuses on gender equality to improve the socio-economic conditions of women and men. In addition, disadvantaged population groups such as children, women, people with different abilities, older people and minorities are included in project activities wherever possible.</p><p>Peace and livelihoods</p><p>The project has two main components: peacebuilding and livelihoods interventions in host and refugee communities. Under the first component, a series of trainings are provided to improve the peace- and conflict-management skills of religious and community leaders of host and refugee communities and restore indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms. Members of academic institutions and government staff are trained in conflict-sensitive programming and Do-No-Harm. Local radio stations are used to spread peace messages in local languages. Peace clubs are organised in schools to promote the inclusion of peace education in the curriculum. Project staff are also trained in gender mainstreaming and Do-No-Harm. The formation of forums for local government employees and refugees as well as other support structures for the communities is being promoted.</p><p>Livelihood interventions include education on agricultural practices such as crop diversification, low external input agriculture, integrated pest management, backyard gardening as well as the provision of native seeds without hybrids. New fishing groups are formed among the youth and existing fishing cooperatives are strengthened through equipment as well as training in fishing practices, marketing and value chain development.</p><p>Another measure supports newly founded self-help groups with training, for example in entrepreneurial skills, rearing small ruminants, beekeeping, poultry farming or small-scale trade. Others are supported in setting up waste recycling companies and building latrines from plastic bottle waste in schools, for example.</p><p>Women are trained in the use of improved stoves and in food production to increase their income. Community agents are empowered to conduct community discussion forums on GBV, including the establishment of functional reporting structures.</p><p>The exchange of experience and the sharing of best practices in the areas of peacebuilding and livelihoods play an important role in all measures. In this way, the knowledge acquired is paired with the experience gained on the ground.</p><p>Ownership of the target community is ensured through the full participation of its representatives, religious leaders and elders from the beginning of planning to the selection of beneficiaries and implementation of project activities, in close collaboration with existing and new community-based institutions.</p><p>Ensuring food security plays an important role in building a society. Best practice models need to be reviewed for their contextual adaptability. This requires the cooperation of all stakeholders, academia, governments, civil society, the private sector and the UN.

This calls for increasing agricultural productivity which is traditionally defined as producing more output (harvest) with the same input (area, soil, capital, labour) or the same output with less input. Economists refer to this as 'total factor productivity' (TFP), a widely employed metric for comparing agricultural efficiency among nations and measuring progress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, TFP fails to consider the long-term effects of current agricultural practices on soil, biodiversity, health and people. This is a massive flaw, as increasing short-term productivity may jeopardise conditions for future productivity in many ways. For example, the current use of intensive tilling methods can harm the soil; fertilisers may cause health issues; and the humus layer may deteriorate due to insufficient regeneration periods. By neglecting these concerns, TFP presents an incomplete picture.</p><p>For example, in the 1960s, India initiated the 'green revolution' in response to two famines. Geneticist M. S. Swaminathan spearheaded this effort, introducing high-yielding wheat and rice varieties in the western region of Punjab. This aimed to boost productivity, resulting in record-high output. India's 'green revolution' is praised for successfully feeding the growing population and reducing rural poverty.</p><p>Negative consequences of India's green revolution Decades later, however, the adverse effects are increasingly evident. Punjab, once known as the 'land of five rivers' is projected to transform into a desert within 25 years due to the water-intensive cultivation of rice. Continued soil degradation, declining health and reduced seed variety pose persistent challenges. Moreover, the climate crisis is making wet and dry seasons less predictable.</p><p>Severe social consequences ensued too. Farmers are forced to buy expensive genetically modified seeds and fertilisers from major corporations to grow crops on depleted soil. As a result, many of them have incurred substantial debts, leading to tens of thousands of suicides every year. Additionally, Punjab has gained notoriety as India's 'cancer capital' due to the widespread use of hazardous agrochemicals.</p><p>Despite all this, metrics such as TFP suggest that India's productivity increased following the green revolution. They focus on short-term economic output rather than long-term net gain for the planet and people and fail to take into account potential long-term destruction. However, if agricultural practices undermine the sustained productivity of nature or people, hindering people's ability to lead fulfilled and healthy lives, they should not be labelled as productive.</p><p>Productivity versus reproductivity</p><p>There is a growing consensus that a shift in perspective on agricultural productivity is necessary. Instead of focusing solely on short-term surpluses, we should assess how agricultural practices can be reproduced in the future. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider the term 'reproductivity' rather than 'productivity'.</p><p>The conversation around agricultural productivity is shifting towards more sustainability. There is a growing interest in re-designing agricultural systems in the name of agroecology, permaculture, agroforestry and regenerative agriculture. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on involving local communities in decision-making processes.</p><p>Measuring ecological and social sustainability</p><p>The challenging question is how to measure agricultural (re)productivity, regenerativity or sustainability. Obviously, it requires a much broader time frame, but quantifying long-term consequences is difficult due to the inaccuracy of current climate models. The complexity increases when considering long-term ecological and socio-economic effects.</p><p>However, farmers adopting more sustainable methods need to monitor progress. Data providers use modern technology to quantify soil functional biodiversity and the potential to store water and carbon. While quantifying soil biodiversity is rather complex, measuring above-ground biodiversity effects is even more difficult. It requires various data points, such as satellite data, bio-acoustics and samples from environmental DNA (eDNA). Making assumptions about future developments is also necessary.</p><p>Financing is crucial</p><p>Quantifying sustainable agriculture is essential for attracting financial rewards from political schemes, customers and investors. This is crucial because agricultural (re)productivity needs to be sustainable regarding finance too. Simply telling a farmer that a change in practices will start paying out in ten years, but will decrease yields for the next five years, is not a compelling argument without schemes guaranteeing compensation in the meantime.</p><p>Recent developments in the debate on payments for ecosystem services provide hope for innovative rewards for farmers adopting reproductive practices. However, we are still at the very beginning of a new productivity regime, and there is much work ahead. We can start by redefining India's green revolution not merely as a period of productivity gain but as a lesson on how not to measure agricultural productivity in the future.</p><p>Literature</p><p>Schragmann, H., 2024: Produktivit\u00e4t neu denken.

When communities have control over their land, they are more likely to establish protected areas, implement wildlife corridors and apply traditional ecological knowledge in ways that safeguard local biodiversity. Diverse ecosystems, in turn, are more resilient to climate disruptions.</p><p>Rural communities intimately understand the unique climate challenges they face. With secure land tenure, they will develop local adaptation strategies that suit their needs, including crop diversification, soil improvement and sustainable water management.</p><p>At the same time, secure land tenure serves climate-change mitigation too:</p><p>Trees take many years to grow, and rural families who know they will benefit from long-term investments are more likely to engage in afforestation and reforestation. Trees are carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide and mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions. To some extent, international funding is available for afforestation and reforestation. However, secure tenure rights are often a precondition for participating in projects related to REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).</p><p>Tenure security allows communities to invest in agroecology and organic farming. These environment-friendly methods reduce the need for chemical inputs, ultimately lowering carbon emissions from the agricultural sector.</p><p>People with land-tenure rights can participate in generation of solar and wind power. By diversifying sources of revenue and contributing to clean energy generation, these initiatives help to reduce the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Advocacy matters</p><p>The empowerment of local rural communities through secure land-tenure rights requires concerted efforts on multiple fronts. Too many rural people have no rights - or only rather shaky rights - to the land they depend on. Women in particular are often denied what they should be entitled to.</p><p>Advocacy plays a pivotal role in ensuring that policymakers recognise the intrinsic links between land tenure on the one hand and climate adaptation and mitigation on the other. Advocacy groups will obviously benefit from solid data and scientific evidence. It is important to highlight success stories. Such examples can inspire others and encourage policymakers to promote change. On the other hand, case studies and evidence documenting disasters can help to avoid repeating mistakes.</p><p>A positive example is the promotion of mangrove co-management approaches in Bangladesh. A key component was the allocation of clear tenure rights to local communities. Land tenure allows them to use and manage mangroves in ways that increase their resilience to flooding resulting from sea-level rise.</p><p>It is important to push for reforms and policy initiatives to enhance local people's land tenure. It also makes sense to promote collective land use planning, involving rural communities in climate action. Relevant policy measures include:</p><p>the legal recognition of customary land rights,</p><p>streamlined land-registration processes and</p><p>protection against land grabbing.</p><p>Collective action</p><p>Advocacy is more effective when diverse stakeholders collaborate. Civil-society organisations, community-based initiatives, research institutions and government agencies should cooperate on amplifying the message. So far, however, there is a lack of grassroots involvement. All too often, local voices are not heard. Community-based organisations must be empowered, not least because they are essential for reaching out to rural people and convincing them of new approaches.</p><p>The Global Forum on Agricultural Research and Innovation is a multi-stakeholder membership-based platform. To emphasise inclusiveness, it will soon change its acronym from GFAR to GFAiR. Its mission includes focusing on small farmers' empowerment.

At the same time, food production contributes to climate change, causing about 30?% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. This multifaceted problem needs a multifaceted solution. The global community, and countries in their contexts, must modify food systems in ways that overcome current food insecurity and ensure food security long term. All issues must be addressed head on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Food security' is defined as access to sufficient quantities of food in appropriate quality. It obviously depends on an adequate and affordable supply of all ingredients required for a nutritious diet. Today, about 735 million people around the world do not get sufficient food and are undernourished as a result. About 3 billion, moreover, do not consume healthy diets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unless comprehensive action is taken, the climate crisis will make matters worse. A holistic agri-food system perspective must consider the entire range of actors involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products. It must also take account of agriculture (including livestock), forestry, fisheries and food industries, as well as the broader economy, social disparities and the natural environment.</p><p>A sustainable food system must achieve good nutrition for all in a way that preserves the foundations of future generations' food security. This challenge has economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions. It is crucial to preventing further loss of biodiversity and to stabilising the climate.</p><p>Mitigation, adaptation, transformation</p><p>Many national food systems, as well as the global food system, are losing resilience. 'Resilience' is the capability to cope with shocks without significant loss of livelihood, health and nutrition. Food-system resilience can be understood as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure to climate risks. It is therefore essential to limit the climate-related hazards that affect food supply, reduce food systems' vulnerability and lower people's exposure to risks. Three policy approaches serve this triple purpose:</p><p>Mitigation of climate change. Radically reducing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is indispensable for sustainable food security. Global heating is leading to extreme weather events, which affect production as well as farm workers' health. Moreover, recent science suggests that extreme heat curtails photosynthesis, with serious impacts on crops and forests. And this is not just a terrestrial agenda, because climate change affects oceans, which also have a bearing on food systems. Nature-based solutions such as agroforestry, coupled with sustainable land and soil management, serve mitigation. However, mitigation in itself is no longer enough to safeguard food security.</p><p>Adaptation to climate change. People can protect themselves by increasing their chances to cope. Important issues include affordable access to clean energy, water and healthcare. All of them have a bearing on good nutrition. Long-term adaptation, however, will be impossible unless mitigation puts an end to further heating.</p><p>Transformation. Socio-ecological systems, including the lifestyles of wealthy nations, must change to become sustainable. In particular, people in high-income countries must reduce their consumption and assume responsibility for their impact on the environment.</p><p>The climate crisis negatively affects food security in several ways. For example, access to safe drinking water is becoming more precarious. Climate events like floods often disrupt it. Diarrhoeal diseases, however, affect humans' intake of micronutrients. These illnesses have a strong correlation with rising temperatures. At the same time, heat waves make it more difficult to handle food safely.</p><p>The climate crisis also affects market dynamics and causes price volatility. Price hikes are happening more frequently. Several issues can exacerbate the impacts of weather-related shortfalls in food production. They include poor market transparency, financial speculation in commodity markets as well as export restrictions. The current grain-market disruptions resulting from Russia's attack on Ukraine show how important unrestricted exports are.</p><p>Crucial policy areas</p><p>Policymakers' action must not only boost food systems' resilience against known risks around the world, but also increase resilience to so-far unknown ones. Cross-cutting action is necessary. In particular, progress is needed in seven policy areas:</p><p>Sustainable land management (SLM): Relevant aspects include sustainable water management, ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, climate adaptation and mitigation as well as the protection of biodiversity. SLM incentives (such as payments for ecosystem services) are necessary. Crop cultivation and livestock production must be practiced in economically viable and environmentally sustainable ways. Social protection. Poverty often undermines families' food security. Nutrition interventions like school meal programmes are helpful. So are cash-transfer schemes or job creation. Countries with low and middle incomes deserve support for improving social protection. Access to healthcare and education are essential. Where related polices are not in place, they should be adopted. Food security hinges on the reduction of inequality. Diversification. Diversifying agriculture and supply chains strengthens food-system resilience. However, diversification has costs as it reduces opportunities for economies of scale and specialisation. Transaction costs tend to rise accordingly. Another challenge is that resilience is not just about withstanding current shocks, but also about maintaining the capacity for future development. If diversification hampers the latter, it is not fully conducive to resilience building.</p><p>International trade. Ensuring free and open global food trade will require a reinvigoration of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Panic-induced border closures lead to international price spikes. Transparent information on production, stocks and government interventions around the world is critical and must be made publicly available (e.g., through the Agricultural Market Information System - AMIS). Trade facilitation in terms of investments in infrastructure - including particularly the digitisation of customs systems - matters too.</p><p>Insurance is a promising tool to strengthen food-system resilience. It spreads both the risks and the costs of negative shocks among a large pool of people, enhancing resilience at the level of individuals. However, it does not prevent or reduce climate risks. Insurance may thus prove counterproductive if it motivates people to continue unsustainable activities. Though this kind of financial service is quite effective in terms of managing individual shocks, it is less useful when many people experience shock impacts at once, as is typically the case in extreme weather events. Migration. In response to the climate crisis, people are leaving their homes. In some cases, migration is basically a form of livelihood diversification. Remittances from migrant workers contribute to their families' resilience after all. However, entire areas are likely to become uninhabitable, for example, as the rising sea level inundates islands. Migration processes and policies need to be coordinated, and both sending and receiving countries must act in ways that make migration strengthen the resilience of individuals and systems. Climate refugees from countries that are becoming uninhabitable must get an internationally recognised climate refugee passport.</p><p>Science-based innovation. Science is facilitating key innovations in food systems, including efforts to reduce risks and to enhance productivity. Bioscience and digital technology are important. Scientific research also helps to find new ways to maintain and, if necessary, renew productive soils, water resources and even entire landscapes. Science is also needed to protect biodiversity, including agricultural genetic diversity. Research can help to reduce inequality too. More funding is needed for research on food systems.</p><p>We live in the Anthropocene, the age in which humanity is shaping the Earth's geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere. Action to enhance food security must be embedded in a broad strategic agenda of transformation. The global community must shift to a sustainable bioeconomy. It also needs a coherent governance structure to safeguard both food security and the global environment. The SDGs provide the concept, but not the policy framework for such joint action.</p><p>Long-term food security is intricately linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biodiversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Sustainable Development Goals. So far, appropriate funding has not been made available for any of the above-mentioned global agreements. That must change for the sake of humanity's common future.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Moreover, recent science suggests that extreme heat curtails photosynthesis, with serious impacts on crops and forests.

Such unique forms of land use have evolved over centuries, harmonising with nature. The wisdom passed down through generations has resulted in sustainable ecosystems, enabling local communities to feed themselves while also preserving natural resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recognises such unique ecosystems by designating them Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). China boasts 19 out of the 74 GIAHS worldwide as of June 2023. Qingtian county in Zhejiang Province is known for its traditional rice-fish culture, while other GIAHS in China include a mountainous region, also in Zhejiang, where mushroom cultivation coexists with sustainable agroforestry, and the city of Fuzhou with its jasmine and tea culture system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GIAHS are complex systems with interconnected components working together. They exhibit remarkable agrobiodiversity, which is defined by the FAO as the variety of animals, plants and microorganisms that are used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture, including crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries.</p><p>A key aspect of GIAHS is the presence of different types of diversity, namely:</p><p>agri-species diversity,</p><p>agroecosystem and landscape diversity and</p><p>agricultural diversity.</p><p>Biodiversity strengthens ecosystems</p><p>There are several ways to enhance agri-species diversity. One method is mixed cropping, where different crops are grown together in the same field. Another approach is intercropping, where a crop is planted immediately after another crop is harvested in the same field (Zhang et al., 2016). Introducing other species is an option too. For example, as mentioned above, rice fields can be enriched with fish and, in some cases, ducks as well.</p><p>Positive interactions can arise when different species utilise available resources in their unique ways. For example, rice plants provide both nourishment and shade to fish. In return, the fish consume pests, enhance the soil and fertilise the plants through their waste.</p><p>Increased biodiversity can therefore enhance ecosystem functions, productivity and stability. A study conducted in Zhejiang found that rice yields in rice-fish culture were significantly higher than in rice monoculture without fish. This improvement was achieved without the use of pesticides. Additionally, the presence of fish minimised weed and pest populations (Xie et al., 2011). Other studies have arrived at similar results.</p><p>Agroecosystem and landscape diversity</p><p>In various GIAHS locations, distinctive agricultural landscapes have developed as a result of the dynamic interplay between humans and nature. They can consist of forests, grasslands or farmlands and can also be influenced by rivers and lakes. Moreover, the homes of the local residents who have contributed to the formation of these areas over extended periods, are an integral part of these landscapes.</p><p>One example of resourceful land management can be found in northern China's mountainous region of Shexian. Throughout the centuries, residents constructed large-scale dryland terraces on steep hillsides. These structures allow them to optimise the use of limited water and soil resources. On these terraces, they grow a variety of crops such as Chinese prickly ash, walnuts, millet and corn. The resulting cultivated landscape is a mixture of stone terraces, forests, shrubs, waterways and communities in the valley. The individual components are closely interconnected and coexist harmoniously.</p><p>Agri-cultural diversity</p><p>Biodiversity is also closely connected to cultural diversity. In areas designated as GIAHS, local residents have adapted to their natural environment over long periods of time. The rich experiences of various ethnic groups are evident in their unique cultures, which form a significant aspect of GIAHS. In southern China, for example, the Dong people keep not only fish in their rice fields, but also ducks. This diversity in agriculture is tightly interwoven with their traditional culture, encompassing aspects such as diet, clothing, architecture and medicine. Additionally, immaterial aspects like religion, traditions and locally applied rules play a role in preserving agricultural diversity (Min et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2016).</p><p>Protecting valuable agricultural landscapes</p><p>There are three main steps to protecting unique agroecosystems efficiently. First, it is important to understand why residents value and maintain the ecosystem. That requires conducting in-depth research on the subject and showing respect for the local communities.</p><p>Second, broad participation in protective measures is essential. China has introduced a five-step approach that involves governments, corporations, researchers, social organisations and farmers (Min et al., 2022). The latter play a particularly important role in protecting the biodiversity of GIAHS.</p><p>Third, it is crucial to promote multi-disciplinary research (Zhang et al., 2016). This involves providing assistance to researchers, farmers and other stakeholders so they can explore the various benefits that ecosystems offer to humanity. The focus should be on the relationship between economic development and the preservation of agrobiodiversity. That includes supporting agricultural practices which help maintain this diversity.</p><p>Protection and productivity</p><p>To preserve biodiversity, it is beneficial for GIAHS regions to be economically productive. The distinct ecological environments of GIAHS offer good conditions for producing high quality (organic) products. Considering the growing demand for healthier food in China, these products have strong market potential.</p><p>Brands have been successfully created in various places, for instance in the aforementioned Qingtian county, where rice cultivation is combined with fish farming. The GIAHS project significantly enhanced the recognition of both rice and fish. As a result, rice produced by that method commands notably higher prices than conventional rice. The price of fish has also risen sharply since the project's start (Zhang et al., 2016). Other GIAHS locations in China have achieved remarkable success in marketing their products as well (Zhang et al., 2016).</p><p>GIAHS combine traditional cultivation techniques with modern approaches to sustainability and resource efficiency. They offer a blueprint for living and doing business sustainably and in harmony with nature. We should follow their example when it comes to tackling major global challenges like the climate crisis, disaster preparedness, food security and biodiversity loss.</p><p>References</p><p>GIAHS at the FAO:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fao.org/giahs\">https://www.fao.org/giahs</url></p><p>Min, Q., Zhang, D., 2008: Ecological connotation of some Dong Minority's taboos.

In order to support the rural population while simultaneously counteracting species loss, KfW has launched a regional programme on behalf of the German Federal Government with the aim of promoting agrobiodiversity in and through indigenous smallholder communities.</p><p>Example in Tacuba, El Salvador: The community is located on the edge of El Imposible National Park, the country's largest and species-rich national park. Around 400 tree species, almost 300 different bird species, numerous mammals and hundreds of species of butterflies are found there. The population is largely indigenous and thrives on agriculture.</p><p>Smallholder families receive support from the regional 'Agrobiodiversity in Central America' programme so that they can maintain their traditional production methods. 'It's about improving the nutritional situation while simultaneously preserving the diversity of their natural environment,' said Susanne Berghaus, Portfolio Manager. This preserves the gene pool, which is crucial for adapting to changing climatic conditions. This approach also increases balance within the ecosystem - which in turn contributes to climate change mitigation, as plants, forests and soil generate carbon sinks.</p><p>A total of 25,000 people in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama benefit from the programme, which has three main objectives: to improve productivity on traditional farms, to further process and market their products and to disseminate knowledge about plants and traditional farming practices.</p><p>The Costa Rica-based non-governmental organisation ACICAFOC (Asociaci\u00f3n Coordinadora Ind\u00edgena y Campesina de Agroforester\u00eda Comunitaria Centroamericana) is implementing the programme for KfW. There is a lively exchange with the indigenous smallholders; the support ideas usually come from the local groups themselves.</p><p>A lot has happened in the community of Tacuba since the promotional activities began. Gardens for medicinal plants have been created as well as croplands for cassava, coffee and cocoa, and fruit trees with varieties such as papaya, loquat, avocado, guan\u00e1bana or pigeon peas. Local vegetables such as Creole cucumber or spinach also grow there. The fact that everything blooms and sprouts is also due to a good dozen reservoirs for rain water, which were built with the help of the programme. The special thing about it is that farming activities take place within an agroforestry system; in other words, they are combined with trees or shrubs - this is important for climate change mitigation.</p><p>Almost 70 small-scale projects and communities are now part of the programme. The measures look a little different everywhere, but they have the same goal: to secure the livelihoods of the predominantly poor population by using traditional and sustainable farming practices. 'This is good for people and for the environment - which means that people will ultimately benefit from it twice,' said Susanne Berghaus, describing the success of the programme.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Local vegetables such as Creole cucumber or spinach also grow there.

The full updated announcement is set out below. The above change has been reflected in the Energy Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24) which is available on the Shell website and has been marked with a footnote in the ETS24 itself. An updated version of the ETS24 has also been filed with the NSM. ---   * Shell will continue its drive to halve emissions from its operations (Scope     1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2023,     Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net     carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with     2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.   * To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a     new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products     by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [A].   * Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of     2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in     the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. \"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer. \"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world- leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets:   * By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve     emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above     and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization     Charter agreed at COP28.   * We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were     one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane     emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity -     significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to     the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further     supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring.   * In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the     energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the     third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors   * For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and     performance please read the full report, online here:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>)   * Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at     Shell's 2024 AGM.   * Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales     volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and     reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.   * We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our     oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).     That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer     emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517     million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes     CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by     2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes,     impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.   * Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by     both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions).     While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we     cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments     and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in     demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions,     more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition     of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of     renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy,     one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our     determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to     our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up     low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of     Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the     largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.   * Find out more about Shell's 2023 Capital Markets Day online:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>) Enquiries UK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550 Shell plc - Energy Transition Strategy Chair's message This energy transition update marks an important moment for Shell. It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].  A. Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\\xEDzen  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low- carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one- third compared with the world's best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company     of Nigeria Limited (SPDC  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]  A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the     40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes     associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading     purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.

H. Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by     2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.  I. We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use     of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category     11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category     11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and     569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles.

Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this 10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low- carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. In non-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10% of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio- feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector.  A. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap     reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO(2) emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio- alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles,  including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging           points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO(2) includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO(2) emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.  A. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low- carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:   * Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon     intensity.   * Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil     production stable.   * Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to     offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s. -------------------------------------------------   Estimated share of energy sales 2016-2030 [A] +------------------+------+------+--------------+ |                  | 2016 | 2023 | 2030         | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Oil products [B] | 57%  | 48%  | 39%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | LNG              | 14%  | 22%  | 26%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Pipeline gas     | 25%  | 21%  | 21%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Electricity      | 3%   | 7%   | 11%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Biofuels         | 1%   | 2%   | 3%           | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ [A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non- operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.  A. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities     (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where     hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.  A.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to:   * Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional     energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and     hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.   * Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil     products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in     areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.   * Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of     the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own     production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutions     for our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future   * Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and     lubricant offerings   * Building for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels   * Preparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storage   * Supported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low- carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low- carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today.   Scaling our network of public EV charging points   Thousands              2020   2021    2022    2023     2025   2030   Other      0.5    0.002   0.022   0.021    ~70    ~200   Asia       0.5    0.068   0.27    1.002   China      0      1.964   17.55   32.576   Europe     0      5.021   8.937   16.579   Americas   0      0.044   0.07    3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen- based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Ra\\xEDzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.   Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly               2025   2030   2035   2040   2045                            2050   Gas          2.1    2.2    2.4    2.6    2.9                             3.4   Hydrogen       0    0.1    0.3    0.5    0.7                               1   Batteries    0.2    0.4    0.5    0.8    1.1                             1.7   Other        0.4    0.3    0.3    0.4    0.4                             0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation. Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023. Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low- carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO(2) from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co(2) capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen- based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non- operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm(3)) Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in our Upstream business In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO(2)e in 2022.  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\\xEDzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Ra\\xEDzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia FerrariShell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half- times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to- hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO(2) since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year [A]. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The CO(2) will be shipped from two of \\xD8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO(2) equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The captured CO(2) will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO(2) emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. [A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first- ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO(2) captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:   * Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.     For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software     system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they     emit.   * Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our     CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's     largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.   * Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable     hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO(2) emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start- ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)  Sector                               Policy Positions           Advocacy Theme

activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low- carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross- border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments     and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of     Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership. Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)  A. On a net basis.  B. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.  C. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into     low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning     plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.

The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be     recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact     of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  B. Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell- operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve     near zero methane emissions by 2030  B. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as     the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total     volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.  C. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected)     defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of     oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.  D. Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control     including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy     Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset     remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as     aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower- carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\\xB0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\\xB0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5\\xB0C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\\xB0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.  A. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of     limiting warming to 1.5\\xB0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning     warming to 1.5\\xB0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much     the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5\\xB0C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under- represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:   * Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net     basis (2016 baseline);   * Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and   * Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero     methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:   * LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;   * Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in     support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission     by 2030, on a net basis; and   * Supporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-     out.      A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category         11) were 517 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO(2)e         in 2021. For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a \"significant best efforts basis\". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures.

Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short- term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\\xB0C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three?high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023.   Disclosure framework             2022   2023 -----------------------------------------------   Yes, meets all criteria             5      2 -----------------------------------------------   Partial, meets some criteria        3      7 -----------------------------------------------   No, does not meet any criteria      1      1 ----------------------------------------------- We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.

Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2) compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2 )equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e( CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

By the end of 2023,     Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net     carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with     2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.   * To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a     new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products     by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). [A]   * Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of     2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in     the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. \"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer. \"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world- leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets:   * By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve     emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above     and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization     Charter agreed at COP28.   * We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were     one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane     emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity -     significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to     the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further     supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring.   * In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the     energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the     third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors   * For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and     performance please read the full report, online here:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>)   * Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at     Shell's 2024 AGM.   * Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales     volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and     reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.   * We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our     oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).     That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer     emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517     million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes     CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by     2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes,     impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.   * Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by     both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions).     While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we     cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments     and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in     demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions,     more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition     of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of     renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy,     one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our     determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to     our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up     low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of     Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the     largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.   * Find out more about Shell's 2023 Capital Markets Day online :     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> Enquiries UK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550 Shell plc - Energy Transition Strategy Chair's message This energy transition update marks an important moment for Shell. It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].  A. Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\\xEDzen  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low- carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one- third compared with the world's best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company     of Nigeria Limited (SPDC  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]  A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the     40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes     associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading     purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.

H. Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by     2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.  I. We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use     of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category     11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category     11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and     569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles.   Population, GDP, demand and consumption of energy 2000-2040                                             2000-2040   Population                                x1.5   GDP                                       x3.4   Aviation (passenger km)                   x5.3   Passenger road (vehicle km)               x3.1   Marine (tonne km)                         x2.2   Heavy industry (tonne steel equivalent)   x2.6 Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023). Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this 10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Source: Shell analysis of IEA Extended Energy Balances (2023). Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low- carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. In non-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10% of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio- feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector.  A. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap     reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO(2) emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio- alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel                             Passenger road transport    Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25   million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil   production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles,  including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging           points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO(2) includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO(2) emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.  A. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low- carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:   * Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon     intensity.   * Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil     production stable.   * Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to     offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s. -------------------------------------------------   Estimated share of energy sales 2016-2030 [A] +------------------+------+------+--------------+ |                  | 2016 | 2023 | 2030         | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Oil products [B] | 57%  | 48%  | 39%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | LNG              | 14%  | 22%  | 26%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Pipeline gas     | 25%  | 21%  | 21%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Electricity      | 3%   | 7%   | 11%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Biofuels         | 1%   | 2%   | 3%           | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ [A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non- operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.  A. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities     (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where     hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.  A.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to:   * Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional     energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and     hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.   * Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil     products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in     areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.   * Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of     the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own     production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutions     for our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future   * Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and     lubricant offerings   * Building for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels   * Preparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storage   * Supported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low- carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low- carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today.   Scaling our network of public EV charging points   Thousands              2020   2021    2022    2023     2025   2030   Other      0.5    0.002   0.022   0.021    ~70    ~200   Asia       0.5    0.068   0.27    1.002   China      0      1.964   17.55   32.576   Europe     0      5.021   8.937   16.579   Americas   0      0.044   0.07    3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen- based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Ra\\xEDzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.   Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly               2025   2030   2035   2040   2045                            2050   Gas          2.1    2.2    2.4    2.6    2.9                             3.4   Hydrogen       0    0.1    0.3    0.5    0.7                               1   Batteries    0.2    0.4    0.5    0.8    1.1                             1.7   Other        0.4    0.3    0.3    0.4    0.4                             0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation. Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023. Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low- carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO(2) from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co(2) capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen- based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non- operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm(3)) Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in our Upstream business In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO(2)e in 2022.  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\\xEDzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Ra\\xEDzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia FerrariShell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half- times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to- hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO(2) since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The CO(2) will be shipped from two of \\xD8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO(2) equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The captured CO(2) will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO(2) emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first- ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO(2) captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:   * Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.     For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software     system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they     emit.   * Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our     CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's     largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.   * Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable     hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO(2) emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start- ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)  Sector                               Policy Positions           Advocacy Theme

activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low- carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross- border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments     and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of     Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership. Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)  A. On a net basis.  B. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.  C. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into     low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning     plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.

The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be     recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact     of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  B. Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell- operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve     near zero methane emissions by 2030  B. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as     the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total     volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.  C. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected)     defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of     oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.  D. Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control     including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy     Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.  B. Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and     higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than     those of oil products.  C. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and     increasing sales of renewable power.  D. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen,     which are low- and zero-carbon products.  E. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source.  F. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset     remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as     aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower- carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\\xB0C above pre- industrial levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\\xB0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\\xB0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5\\xB0C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\\xB0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.  A. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of     limiting warming to 1.5\\xB0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning     warming to 1.5\\xB0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much     the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5\\xB0C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under- represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:   * Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net     basis (2016 baseline);   * Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and   * Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero     methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:   * LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;   * Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in     support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission     by 2030, on a net basis; and   * Supporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-     out.      A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category         11) were 517 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO(2)e         in 2021. For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a \"significant best efforts basis\". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B]                     2020     2021     2022     2023 -----------------------------------------------------   MSCI               A        AA       AA       AA -----------------------------------------------------   Sustainalytics   36.8 H   35.1 H   34.7 H   33.7 H -----------------------------------------------------   ISS                C        C+       C+       C+ ----------------------------------------------------- ISS The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.  A.

Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short- term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\\xB0C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three?high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023.   Disclosure framework             2022   2023 -----------------------------------------------   Yes, meets all criteria             5      2 -----------------------------------------------   Partial, meets some criteria        3      7 -----------------------------------------------   No, does not meet any criteria      1      1 ----------------------------------------------- We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.

Forward-looking statements This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec- filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2) compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2 )equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e( CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

Environmental concerns cast a shadow over the crop in other parts of the world. What will African farmers do differently?</p><p>Baker Ssengendo's vision for the future of Uganda starts with an avocado seedling. \"The avocado tree has a lifespan of about 50 years. The life expectancy of an average Ugandan is about 60 years. A tree can benefit them their entire life,\" he told DW.Ssengendo works on the 1,000 hectares of Musubi Farm in Nansana, central Uganda \u2014 the largest Hass avocado farm in the country. \"By working in avocado farming, I am fulfilling my life dream. We want to lift our communities out of poverty.\"Due to high global demand, avocado has become a lucrative export product. Its consumption per capita increased by 406% between 1990 and 2017 in the US alone.The so-called green gold is rapidly gaining popularity on the African continent. Both Nigeria and Uganda aim to drastically increase their avocado production and become top exporters in the next ten years. Kenya is already amongst the global top ten. Export revenues in the East African country surged by a third between 2019 and 2020. Farmers are hailing the crop as an antidote to poverty in rural areas.But the sought-after fruit has been making negative headlines around the world. Water shortages and the destruction of biodiversity have been linked to its production. The environmental issues have cast a dark shadow over the commercial farming of avocados in Latin America's top exporting countries, such as Mexico and Chile.On the other hand, African avocado farming is promising a brighter future, according to both farmers and scientists. Due to an emphasis on smallholders and beneficial rain patterns, the crop's production is expected to be less environmentally harmful than on the American continent.Avocados the new oil?\"Avocado is actually a godsend because farmers can use it as an alternative to coffee farming,\" Sammy Carsan, agroforestry scientist at the World Agroforestry Center in Nairobi, told DW.In recent years, fierce competition between large retailers has driven down coffee prices. In 2019, coffee farmers' earnings dropped to their lowest in 13 years. Now, hopes are high for avocado to fill the income gap.According to The Guardian Nigeria, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called the fruit \"the new oil of Nigeria\" during a meeting with members of the Avocado Society of Nigeria (ASN) late last year. The politician-turned-avocado-enthusiast is the largest stakeholder in the society and owns 20 hectares of Hass avocado farming land himself \u2014 the avocado variety most commonly used for exports.\"He gave us the mandate of making the country Africa's largest avocado exporter by 2030,\" Adeniyi Sola Bunmi, Executive Director of ASN, told DW. Currently, there are only 120 Hass avocado farmers in Nigeria. ASN is training smallholders wishing to switch to the crop and provides them with Hass seedlings.In Uganda, the Ministry of Agriculture recently partnered with Musubi Farm, hoping to start commercial export next year. Musubi is already employing 1,000 people from the local community. \"We are also financially supporting a local school and are providing land for a local police force in order to deal with crime in the community. Avocados can transform our community,\" director of communications, Ssengendo, said. The promise of smallholder farmingLarge-scale commercial avocado farming is at the core of environmental issues, such as soil degradation, in Latin America. However, in East Africa and Nigeria, smallholders are at the center of a more sustainable avocado farming approach.\"Our plan is to have 75% of avocados produced by smallholder farmers and 25 percent by our farm,\" Ssengendo said of his vision for Uganda. In neighboring Kenya, smallholders are already spearheading avocado production, with most avocado farmers only owning about two hectares of land, according to Carsan.Small farms mean less strain on the environment, Ruben Sommaruga, Professor of Limnology of the University of Innsbruck, told DW. \"Large industrial production always implies a large use of pesticides. That is usually not the case with smallholder farmers, who can control their small number of trees more easily.\"In smallholder settings, the crop is often complemented with other farming enterprises, such as maize and bean crops, planted for subsistence. According to Samson Ogbole, a sustainable farmer in Nigeria, mixing avocado trees with agroforestry systems can curtail negative environmental effects. \"Planting crops like legumes around the tree crops helps replenish the soil.\"Avocados for rainy daysAccording to the Water Footprint Network, it takes 2,000 liters of water (528 gallons), or 10 full bathtubs, to grow just one kilo of avocados. Planting the fruit has been linked to water shortages in Chile, for example, where farming has affected water availability for human consumption.But the water consumption of the crop shouldn't be removed from its local context, according to Sommaruga. \"It's always a matter of how much and what kind of water you have in the countries where you grow the trees.\"In Uganda and Nigeria, avocado farms are mainly located in areas with beneficial rain patterns, according to Sommaruga.\"The central and southern part of Nigeria receives relatively high precipitation. The south of Uganda does as well. In Kenya, much of the avocado farming is done north of Nairobi, where mountains retain most of the rain.\"Frequent rainfall means farmers do not have to rely on irrigation systems, which artificially apply water to the soil. \"In smallholder settings, avocado is produced on a rain-fed basis with few irrigation systems,\" Carsan said about avocado farmers in Kenya.For now, avocado production has not been linked to water shortages across African farmlands. But, as Sommaruga points out, the rain patterns that avocado farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are benefitting from today are expected to decrease in the future due to climate change.Bunmi from the Avocado Society of Nigeria has also been farming avocados on his land, hoping to export to Ukraine and the United Kingdom in five years. \"Regarding water, I don't see any problem in the next 20 years. But maybe as time goes on,\" Bunmi said. </p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["Due to an emphasis on smallholders and beneficial rain patterns, the crop's production is expected to be less environmentally harmful than on the American continent.

The majority of the SLE leadership and graduates agrees that a new kind of cooperation is needed in order to address all of these crises.</p><p>The SLE employees agree that development cooperation (DC) has to change. The staff have gathered their ideas in a transformation agenda and decided that a new mindset towards DC is needed that includes the following:</p><p>DC must be aware of its responsibility: 'In our opinion, the most important aspect of a transformative DC mindset would be freedom from paternalism.' That means that the funding that is provided would not be understood as 'aid', but rather as 'reparations' for the overuse of human and natural resources with which the global North built up its wealth.</p><p>Practice 'real cooperation' on equal footing: this means that cooperation should not be based on conditionalities. Instead, partners should agree on joint outcomes - which already often happens in practice.</p><p>Acquisition and transmission of transformation knowledge: in order to achieve transformative development, we must depart from our usual technologies and ways of thinking. We have to draft approaches and measures that will bring about the successful transformation to ecological and sustainable development. These measures should function as win-win strategies, meaning that one crisis is not weighed against another, but instead multiple goals can be achieved at the same time. In the process, the global North and global South should constantly be learning from each other.</p><p>The SLE has revised its post-graduate study programme 'International cooperation for sustainable development' and identified three transformation areas it wants to pursue: (1.) Ecosystems and nutrition, (2.) Socio-ecological business and (3.) Governance and participation. In the first area, ecosystems and nutrition, SLE researchers believe that the increasing competition for resources will have to be overcome.</p><p>With regard to land use, moreover, diverse goals such as the preservation of biodiversity, climate protection and food security will have to be integrated. Multifunctional systems should be implemented in agriculture; examples include agroforestry and agrophotovoltaic systems. In order to replace chemicals, these systems could be ecologically intensified, meaning that the ecosystem services of nature are systematically increased (for instance through self-regulation processes, beneficial organisms or a protein plant strategy). 'Closing nutrient cycles' is another strategy, which would prevent the production of excess nitrate while still keeping enough nutrients in the soil. Ecological agriculture must also be improved. The SLE plans to research the corresponding agroecological concepts.</p><p>With regard to the second transformation goal, socio-ecological business, the SLE is striving towards an equitable distribution of resources particularly between richer and poorer countries, but also within societies, along with the systematic inclusion of disadvantaged groups. Economic activity that only is oriented toward growth is also under investigation. The SLE wants to develop new concepts in this area and is asking whether green growth is possible and how green innovations can be achieved.</p><p>With regard to the transformation of governance and participation, SLE researchers are concentrating above all on rural areas. Such regions often only have weak political systems, structures and institutions and are therefore in need of 'good rural governance'.</p><p>The latter should facilitate participation and equal opportunities for people in the countryside and promote cooperation and networking among rural people and with urban areas. The goal is also to achieve a new balance between the country and the city, which would allow rural areas to develop and contribute significantly to the cities' food supply.</p><p>These considerations were expanded on in multiple workshops on a variety of subtopics, to which SLE alumni and other DC professionals contributed ideas. The SLE lecturer for development policy and anti-racism, Boniface Mabanza Bambu, pointed out that DC is still based on colonial narratives. He argued that conceiving of African or Latin American people and societies as 'other', and characterising them as 'underdeveloped' and 'undemocratic', can lead to negative stereotypes.</p><p>He also criticised the fact that DC is dominated by 'western concepts' and 'development expertise', claiming that they often deprecate other knowledge as 'marginal' or 'utopian'. He advocated for a critical (self-)deconstruction of DC, which would involve finding opportunities for marginalised groups to speak for themselves instead of having someone else do it for them. He believes the poor should be the main architects of their fate.</p><p>The SLE wants to take up all of these ideas and incorporate them into its education programmes and research. Doing so will require a lot of effort. SLE director Susanne Neubert summed it up best: 'We all have to develop.'</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["In the first area, ecosystems and nutrition, SLE researchers believe that the increasing competition for resources will have to be overcome.

They are indispensable for global food security. Data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed that farms with fewer than five hectares produced more than 70 % of humanity's food in 2014. As the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved without smallholders, the future of human civilisation hinges on them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Traditional family farming</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">provides highly diversified food products, which contribute to healthy diets,</p><p>offers livelihoods in rural areas where unemployment is a major problem,</p><p>utilises and conserves agrobiodiversity and</p><p>is well adapted to local ecosystems and thus helps to protect invaluable ecosystem services.</p><p>It also matters that traditional farming is based on ancestral knowledge. Though not appreciated by all scientists, it is the basis for agricultural innovations and technologies. For example, breeders of high-yielding varieties typically use genetic information from age-old landraces.</p><p>The farmers concerned are mostly very poor. They often belong to indigenous and other marginalised communities. It is ironic that some of the world's poorest and most neglected communities are in charge of vitally important agriculture systems. These rural communities deserve to be rewarded for the work they are doing, and their culture must not be suppressed or displaced. It must be allowed to evolve in ways that improve their quality of life.</p><p>Distorted idea of modernisation</p><p>Agricultural policies, so far, have been mostly guided by a distorted idea of modernisation. The focus on industrial-scale farming to maximise yields has led to</p><p>unsustainable practices,</p><p>over-exploitation of resources,</p><p>genetic erosion,</p><p>loss of fertile soils,</p><p>imports of exotic domesticated species,</p><p>loss of local knowledge systems and rural values,</p><p>socio-economic instability and</p><p>displacement of marginalised people.</p><p>This kind of high-tech agriculture is not the answer to the multiple problems that haunt humankind. A different approach is needed (see Susanne Neubert in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). Smallholders, family farms and indigenous groups should not be looked down upon. Their production systems should be carefully intensified. It makes sense to use new methods that</p><p>lower environmental impacts,</p><p>can be applied more precisely and</p><p>reduce waste in processing, transport and marketing.</p><p>In many parts of the world, traditional agriculture systems have collapsed or disappeared. That is especially so in supposedly 'advanced' nations. Nonetheless, millions of hectares are still under traditional farm management, with raised fields, terraces, polycultures (with different crops growing in the same field), agroforestry systems et cetera. The stubborn persistence of these practices is evidence of smallholders' creativity and resilience. They have stuck to local strategies and kept developing them in ways that serve their needs and are tailored to their local resources and environment.</p><p>History of marginalisation</p><p>Unfortunately, these local communities have a long history of being neglected. What was prioritised instead was to increase farm production with price subsidies, intensive practices, specialisation and new technologies. As argued above, the price was very high in both socio-economic and environmental terms. Rural poverty has indeed worsened, and migration to urban slums is occurring in many places.</p><p>By contrast, diversified, eco-friendly farming with multi-cropping and various forms of animal husbandry was only rarely promoted. There is a general lack of support for smallholders and especially indigenous farming communities. Precious little research is done to improve their lot. As a result, the foundations of their agricultural 'culture' are being eroded. The biodiversity they have been guarding is disappearing as well.</p><p>Surviving in harsh environments</p><p>The basis for developing sustainable agricultural systems should therefore be the very systems that traditional family farmers have inherited and incrementally modified over centuries. These systems are complex and well adapted to the local conditions. Indeed, smallholders have managed to cope with very harsh environments. Most of their production systems do not depend on external inputs and technologies, but have nonetheless safeguarded communities' basic food security and covered their subsistence needs in the course of history.</p><p>Humanity needs models of agriculture that allow us to eradicate poverty (SDG1) and end hunger (SDG2). Other SDGs, such as climate action (SDG13) or the protection and restoration of ecosystems on land (SDG15), matter too, of course. We need agriculture that is productive, environment-friendly, bio\u00addiverse and socially just. The community-based systems which have fed humankind throughout history meet these criteria. And they still feed masses of people in disadvantaged world regions.</p><p>In appreciation of their relevance, the author, as the Task Manager of the Agenda 21 on behalf of the FAO, launched a programme called GIAHS 20 years ago. The letters stand for Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (see box).</p><p>Focus on Smallholders' needs</p><p>Sustainability must be first ensured at the local level. The logical consequence is that agriculture systems should fit the existing socioeconomic and natural environment. Time-tested community-based systems must not be uprooted or displaced. They must be carefully adopted and enhanced. This is a delicate challenge because there is no blueprint that would fit every situation. Every local system is special. To boost its productivity, one must understand the local ecosystem, relevant science and the local traditional knowledge. The new science of agroecology has its roots in these principals.</p><p>Prospects for the young generation</p><p>Since the early 1980s, hundreds of agroecology projects have been undertaken. They were driven by farmers organisations, visionary scientists and non-governmental organisations. To a minor extent, state agencies were involved too. Experience shows that it is possible to blend traditional knowledge with new scientific insights. This approach serves to increase productivity and improve food security without harming the natural environment. There is an important socio-cultural angle too. The future sustainability of agriculture depends on young people staying in rural areas, implementing farming innovations and creating sustainable livelihoods. If they do not see a future for themselves in the villages, they will leave.</p><p>Agricultural research should focus on smallholders' needs</p><p>Local food sovereignty, moreover, matters very much. It is based on local \u00adautonomy in regard to production, processing, marketing and consumption. Important preconditions are that farmers have appropriate access to land, seeds, water, technology and energy. Farmer-to-farmer networks tend to be very useful in this context.</p><p>Local food sovereignty also means that farming communities must not depend on imported inputs from large multinational corporations. The background is that private-sector giants have a pattern of forcing clients to relying on innovations that enhance corporate profits along with the yields, but do not necessarily improve farming communities' welfare. Around the world, scientific agricultural researchers should therefore focus much more on the needs of smallholders and family farmers (see Hildegard Lingnau on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Historical evidence shows that smallholder farms can play their vital part in</p><p>poverty alleviation,</p><p>economic growth,</p><p>job creation and</p><p>community empowerment.</p><p>To do so, they need to be supported by public policy and government-funded investments. Rural infrastructure is essential. Policymakers must not forget that smallholder provide food to local markets in a potentially resilient way, and their farms serve as social-safety nets.</p><p>The importance of dietary diversity must be recognised too. The combination of various crops and animals in traditional agroecosystems allows farmers to make good use of ecological niches; thus increasing the variety of locally available nutritious food (see Rabson Kondowe on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). </p><p>Indeed, opting for one variety of a crop instead of another can make the difference between micronutrient deficiency or micronutrient adequacy. The traditional landraces, which local communities have bred of millennia, have further vitally important qualities. Their diversity offers varieties that suit many different environmental circumstances, which is precisely why they are needed to create high-yielding varieties of rice, wheat and maize (see Melaku Worede on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Global food security cannot be sustainably achieved without the local plant-genetic resources and the traditional knowledge of marginalised farming communities in many world regions. Their own food security, moreover, will benefit from incremental change geared to higher productivity.</p><p>The plain truth is that some of the world's poorest people are the best custodians of genetic resources and other natural resources, environmental services as well as cultural inheritance. Improving their lot is the appropriate approach to ending hunger.</p><p>Parviz Koohafkan is the founder and president of the World Agricultural Heritage Foundation.

Named Burj Zanzibar - \"burj\" meaning tower in Arabic - the spectacular high-rise is designed to reach 96 metres in height. Dubbed \"vertical green village\", it would represent an iconic landmark not only for the island but for the whole of Africa and a global environmental milestone, being the first timber structure worldwide of such proportions. The design of the mixed-use apartment and commercial building, in a playful beehive style with breathtaking ocean views, was unveiled to the public in Muscat, Oman on 1 October. Dutch-born architect Leander Moons, responsible for the concept, said: \"Burj Zanzibar is not just an outstanding building but a new ecosystem for the future of living\".  The residential tower with 266 residences is to be located in Fumba Town, East Africa's pioneering eco-town developed by German-led engineering firm CPS. Categorised as a strategic investment and fully supported by the Zanzibar government, the growing city near the capital, where foreigners are allowed to buy, stretches along a 1.5-kilometre seashore on the southwest coast. \"Burj Zanzibar will be the highlight and natural continuation of our efforts to provide sustainable housing in Africa, thereby empowering local employment and businesses\", elaborated CPS CEO Sebastian Dietzold in Muscat.  With turquoise seas, white sandy beaches and a UNESCO-protected historic Stone Town, Zanzibar recorded 15% annual growth in tourism in recent years and 6.8% economic growth. Earlier this year, the semi-autonomous archipelago, 35 kilometres off the coast of Tanzania, stretched its wings also into another direction, launching an initiative to attract African tech companies with a total worth of six billion dollars.  Benefits of timber  Timber is the oldest building material in the world. As timber technology, it currently enjoys a renaissance because of its environmental benefits and longevity. New timber products such as cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam are considered the building material of the future. One cubic metre of wood binds half a ton of carbon dioxide, whereas conventional concrete construction is responsible for 25% of CO2 emissions.  Once realised, Burj Zanzibar would be the highest timber building in the world and Africa's first high-rise ever in this innovative technology. A few weeks ago the 86.6-metre Ascent Tower in Milwaukee, US, was certified as the world's tallest timber hybrid building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). Africa's highest conventional skyscraper is a 385-metre office tower named \"Iconic Tower\" in Egypt, still under construction.  Tanzania's top skyscraper is the 157-metre Ports Authority building in Dar es Salaam. The world's tallest conventional building is Burj Khalifa in Dubai with 828 metres.  Consortium of specialists from New York to Switzerland  Burj Zanzibar is planned as a hybrid timber tower. A steel-reinforced concrete core is designed to meet all required fire and life safety standards. The project is to be executed by a consortium of leading specialists from Switzerland, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Tanzania and the US. Green roof gardens and planted balconies further reduce the carbon footprint of the building. \"Burj Zanzibar will be a widely visible new landmark for Zanzibar and beyond, not only because of its appearance but because of its construction method\", said architect Leander Moons during the launch event.  Set to promote locally available wood as a building material, Tanzania and its vast land resources for agroforestry would also benefit from the ambitious green mega tower. A large forest development in central Tanzania near Iringa already covers twice the size of New York; \"an enlarged forest industry could create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the East African country\", said CPS Director Dietzold.  Playful, elegant style fitting any culture  The playful architectural style - reminiscent of a beehive with honeycombs - combines modern urban trends with local culture. \"Panorama windows, closed-in green loggias and a modular layout will enhance the green nature of the tower and allow for flexible apartment floor plans, tailor-made for any cultural preferences\", explained lead architect Moons. Residents can have their outdoor garden even on the top floor.  Representing a young, vibrant and most of all sustainable lifestyle, the building allocates a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments and deluxe penthouses. The elegant tower stands on a terraced podium with shared and private gardens , shops and a common pool. Sizes of units range from studios starting at $79,900 to a vast penthouse with a private pool on the 26th floor at $950,880. \"As a global architectural highlight the Burj Zanzibar will be setting a new benchmark of building in the 21st century\", CPS director Sebastian Dietzold concluded.

A few weeks ago the 86.6-metre Ascent Tower in Milwaukee, US, was certified as the world's tallest timber hybrid building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). \u00a0Africa?s highest conventional skyscraper is a 385-metre office tower named ?Iconic Tower? in Egypt, still under construction. Tanzania?s top skyscraper is the 157-metre Ports Authority building in Dar es Salaam. The world?s tallest conventional building is Burj Khalifa in Dubai with 828 metres. Consortium of specialists from New York to Switzerland Burj Zanzibar is planned as a hybrid timber tower.\u00a0 A steel-reinforced concrete core is designed to meet all required fire and life safety standards. The project is to be executed by a consortium of leading specialists from Switzerland, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Tanzania and the US. Green roof gardens and planted balconies further reduce the carbon footprint of the building. ?Burj Zanzibar will be a widely visible new landmark for Zanzibar and beyond, not only because of its appearance but because of its construction method?, said architect Leander Moons during the launch event. Set to promote locally available wood as a building material, Tanzania and its vast land resources for agroforestry would also benefit from the ambitious green mega tower. A large forest development in central Tanzania near Iringa already covers twice the size of New York; ?an enlarged forest industry could create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the East African country?, said CPS Director Dietzold. Playful, elegant style fitting any culture The playful architectural style ? reminiscent of a beehive with honeycombs ? combines modern urban trends with local culture. ?Panorama windows, closed-in green loggias and a modular layout will enhance the green nature of the tower and allow for flexible apartment floor plans, tailor-made for any cultural preferences?, explained lead architect Moons. Residents can have their outdoor garden even on the top floor. Representing a young, vibrant and most of all sustainable lifestyle, the building allocates a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments and deluxe penthouses. The elegant tower stands on a terraced podium with shared and private gardens , shops and a common pool. Sizes of units range from studios starting at $79,900 to a vast penthouse with a private pool on the 26th\u00a0 floor at $950,880. ?As a global architectural highlight the Burj Zanzibar will be setting a new benchmark of building in the 21st century?, CPS director Sebastian Dietzold concluded.

They told DW that taking control is better than protesting government policy.Krishna Narode, 26, from Gangapur village in India's western Maharashtra state, is visibly excited as he surveys his four-acre farm where he cultivates an array of crops and fruits, including papaya, sugar cane, wheat and ginger. In a few months, it will be time for harvesting and Narode knows that his efforts will pay dividends as he has relied on natural farming practices.\"I hope to earn at least 600,000 Indian rupees ( 6,765, $8,190) this year from my harvest. </p><p>In 2016, I earned such a small sum that I wanted to give up. But thanks to new farming methods we have learnt, it is helping our community,\" Narode told DW.A few kilometers away, 51-year-old Mangala Maruti Waghmare, a woman farmer, is hoping to reap a windfall this year from her drumsticks, custard apple and mango produce.\"My fruits are delicious and will sell for twice the general market price. Multi-cropping as a technique is benefitting a lot of farmers here who are willing to change,\" Waghmare told DW.Latur, one of the larger districts in the Marathawada, has been a perennial drought-prone area, notorious for its water scarcity and, at one point, farmer suicides.Five years back, authorities had to deploy special trains to supply water to the region and police had to stand guard outside water tankers, reservoirs and distribution points.Dramatic transformationBut an initiative led by agriculturalist Mahadev Gomare, with the help of a committed band of villagers, helped change the sad state of affairs. A few years ago, they rejuvenated the 143-kilometer-long (89-mile) Manjara river and its tributaries, which are a key source of water for around 500,000 people in 900 villages. Over 900,000 cubic meters of silt was removed from the river, giving it a new life. The silt, in turn, was used in the fields to help level adjoining farms where sharecropping was taken up.A river's ability to recharge groundwater is significantly reduced as silt accumulates at its bottom.\"Once the rivers were revived, it increased the availability of water, and other initiatives to improve the biodiversity and ecology of the area were started,\" Gomare told DW.With technical help from the Art of Living foundation, which has expertise in river rejuvenation, desilting drains, gabion structures and arresting rainwater in rivers and rivulets were taken up. Since then, there has been no looking back for a large section of the farmers living here.The farming community has since gradually moved to natural farming, afforestation, agroforestry, social forestry and climate-resilient farming and seeding practices to green the area and help increase their farm produce.Entire village ecosystems were positively impacted because of the greater water availability, resulting in significant socioeconomic benefits. The changes led to a dramatic transformation in the lives of farmers. \"It has taken time, but our labor has paid off and now we see a smile on many farmers' faces,\" Kaka Sehab Sindi, a farmer, told DW.Other Indian farmers protest\"We know farmers outside Delhi are agitating for a law guaranteeing a minimum support price for their produce, but we decided to change our own fates,\" Ambalesh Kashinath, a cereal crop farmer, told DW.On the outskirts of Delhi, thousands of farmers from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana have been protesting resolutely for weeks against the three farm laws pushed through by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led government.They fear that these laws will destroy their livelihoods by offering big multinational corporations greater power over farming, and by undermining the main forms of state support to the cultivators, including minimum support prices (MSP) and government market committees.Much of the farming practices in the Marathwada region now rely on utilizing the natural processes of the soil and seed system, thus saving on input costs without compromising on the yield. This has become valuable for small farmers who are already financially overstretched.Smart agricultureAccording to government figures, small and marginal farmers with less than two hectares of land account for as much as 86% of the 146 million total agricultural holdings in India.Bringing new technologies and practices to such a large number of smallholders scattered over a vast countryside and integrating them with the modern markets still remain a huge challenge.\"Farmers across the country are not happy with what has happened to their incomes and this is increasingly getting reflected in their protests,\" Pandu Gangadar, a farmer, told DW. \"We understand why Punjab farmers are angry over doing away with state-run wholesale buyers and markets that guaranteed a minimum support price,\" he added.But instead of relying on the government for help, farmers in Marathwada have brought in changes to crop management, leading to better crop yields, improved food security and increased resilience to adverse effects of climate change. </p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["With technical help from the Art of Living foundation, which has expertise in river rejuvenation, desilting drains, gabion structures and arresting rainwater in rivers and rivulets were taken up.

We use it for different purposes, of which three matter in particular in the debate regarding sustainability. They are:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">food security based on agriculture, the conservation of biodiversity and natural ecosystems in protected areas and climate mitigation through the afforestation of deforested places.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All three purposes are vitally important, but they compete for land, a rather limited resource. We are therefore facing a trilemma: choosing one of the three options means we risk neglecting the other two.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem becomes particularly obvious when we consider agricultural biodiversity. The conventional approaches of high-yield farming typically deplete fields' biological diversity. One reason is the application of pesticides. To a large extent, the dramatic erosion of global biodiversity is thus a consequence of the land-use trilemma.</p><p>The good news is that the goals of high yields and safeguarded biodiversity do not rule each other out entirely. Indeed, they can become mutually reinforcing if and when land is used in an eco-friendly way. The trick is to make best use of - and even maximise - the ecosystem services which are provided, for example, by pollinators and other species. This is feasible, provided farmers pay more attention to biodiversity.</p><p>There are at least three relevant dimensions to biodiversity:</p><p>the biodiversity of natural ecosystems and landscapes ('natural biodiversity'), the agricultural biodiversity ('agrobiodiversity') of fields with typical flora and fauna and the biodiversity of plant and animal races that farmers breed ('genetic resources').</p><p>As we are witnessing a mass extinction in regard to each and every one of these dimensions, experts are sounding the alarm. To tackle the dilemma of land-use, it is helpful to focus on the first two dimensions because they compete for land with one another.</p><p>Destroying natural biodiversity Agriculture is indispensable because it provides humanity with food. It has always led to land-use changes. As in earlier times, these changes still go along with carbon emissions and a reduction of biodiversity.</p><p>Large-scale deforestation with the goal of clearing arable land typically occurs in countries with low yields per acre and fast population growth. Both trends are evident in the vast majority of sub-Saharan countries. In most cases, cleared land is used to produce plants to feed the people. National food security is supposed to be achieved that way. However, this approach generally degrades land quality. Soils become less fertile because smallholder farmers are usually too poor to invest in restoring nutrients. Insufficient fertilisation results in low productivity - and then causes further deforestation as people need to clear additional fields.</p><p>On the other hand, large-scale deforestation also occurs in countries that export agricultural commodities. Brazil is a prominent example. It is well known that rainforests are burned down so the cultivation of soy and other kinds of animal feed can be expanded. These commodities are grown for exports to Europe and other advanced economies where farmers need them.</p><p>In this way, global trade is allowing an increasing number of people to rely on diets based on meat and other animal products. The trend started in advanced nations and has spread to urban areas everywhere. One result is that about 2 billion people are now overweight.</p><p>In Germany, the world's leading pork exporter, more than 60?% of agricultural land is currently used for growing animal feed and live-stock farming. If Germans based their diets on cereals and soy instead, large areas could serve the conservation of natural biodiversity.</p><p>Destroying agrobiodiversity</p><p>Current agricultural methods are not only destroying natural biodiversity however. The biodiversity of fields is being depleted as well. A multitude of herbs and grasses is affected, and so are insects including bees and other pollinators. Tiny animals and microorganisms in the soil are being harmed as well.</p><p>In prosperous nations, industrial-scale agriculture has caused massive damage. It depends on intensive application of chemicals. It does not do much crop rotation, but relies on huge amounts of fertiliser, liquid manure and pesticides like Glyphosate to ensure that only the high-yield cultivar will thrive.</p><p>Chemical residues and excessive use of fertiliser, moreover, do not only affect the field and its soil. They contaminate surrounding areas. Impacts are evident kilometres away. For example, groundwater is polluted with nitrate, with biodiversity-\u00addiminishing impacts on rivers, lakes and even the sea.</p><p>Industrial-scale agriculture is marked by considerable inefficiencies and leakages. Animal husbandry, extravagant fertilisation and excessive use of pesticides thus threaten both natural biodiversity and agrobiodiversity.</p><p>It would be wrong, however, to believe that low-input agriculture automatically leads to greater agrobiodiversity. Unless farmers restore nutrients to the soil by applying biomass, manure or mineral fertilisers, they degrade the fields. The biodiversity of the soil suffers, and eventually only particularly resilient, but largely useless weeds remain. Diminished soils, moreover, are especially exposed to erosion, with organic matter being blown away or washed away. When that happens, farming communities typically respond by clearing additional arable land, and the vicious circle keeps spinning.</p><p>Stopping the erosion of species</p><p>If we want to rise to the challenges, we do well to remember that abundant biodiversity is not just a goal in itself. It is actually a blessing to human beings thanks to a broad variety of ecosystem services. Pollination and metabolism are prominent examples. Others are the balance of predators and prey, top-soil development and water bodies' capacity for self-purification. Every one of these ecosystem services is indispensable for farming (see Sundus Saleemi on on our D+C/E+Z platform). Replacing them technologically would be impossible - or at least prohibitively expensive.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have mostly neglected the ecosystem services that result from the diversity of species. The reason is probably that we benefit from those services without payment or effort. Humans are used to taking ecosystem services for granted without any input of our own. Typically, we do not even notice them. However, awareness is slowly growing for how ecosystem services are being diminished.</p><p>The first step to protecting -and eventually expanding - those services, is take their value into account (see Katja Dombrowski onour D+C/E+Z platform). We must rise to this challenge.</p><p>Mass extinction is currently affecting both natural biodiversity and agrobiodiversity. To improve matters, we need radical change at the global level. We must not only safeguard natural ecosystems, but also diversify what is happening in agriculture. Multi-cropping is the indispensable alternative to monocultures. While we keep maximising yields at any cost, we must still strive for high yields. Otherwise, the clearing of additional arable land will continue. That land, however, must be reserved for natural ecosystems.</p><p>The global transition to sustainable land-use will thus hinge on multipurpose strategies in agriculture as well as other sectors. Agroforestry approaches, for example, link agriculture and forestry. It is possible to expand conservation areas while still permitting specific forms of farming. Even in restored peatlands, paludiculture is feasible, so farmers can indeed grow some crops. Multipurpose strategies offer the key to a sustainable future.</p><p>Ending inefficiencies around the world</p><p>At the same time, we must put an end to insufficiencies. An option in low-yield areas such as sub-Saharan countries is to systematically combine mineral fertilisation and organic manure to ensure soil nutrients are restored appropriately. Such an approach will not only lead to higher yields, but will also facilitate more biodiversity both on fields and in wildlife. Further clearance of land will be avoided, and field vegetation will become more diverse and abundant. Prosperous economies, on the other hand, must end inefficiencies by reducing the application of chemicals (see graph).</p><p>Last but not least, we must question current patterns of land-use in countries where industrial-scale agriculture is common. It is high time that famers focused on immediate human needs rather than live-stock farming, such as the production of pigs in Germany, for example. Such a policy shift will solve several problems. Less land will be needed to produce animal feed. The degradation of land through the application of liquid manure will be reduced. People's diets would become healthier, with meat prices rising. As a pleasant side-effect, more space will become available for conserving biodiversity and mitigating the climate crisis.</p><p>From agricultural policy to ecosystem policy</p><p>To rebalance global land-use in ways that facilitate sustainability, we need an appropriate policy environment. One option is to reform the existing policies such as the \u00adEuropean Union's CAP (common agricultural policy) or African countries input subsidy programmes (ISPs) in ways that establish something like a 'Shared Ecosystem Policy' (SEP). To tap the full potential, policymakers must take a comprehensive approach, not only reconsidering agriculture, but reconciling it with all other forms of land-use. The best possible results will be achieved if policymakers emphasise the benefits of eco-system services.</p><p>To tackle the land-use trilemma, we thus must focus on synergies in a holistic perspective. Doing so will require a shared policy framework.</p><p>At regional levels, it is possible to take what is called an 'integrated landscape approach' by involving various stakeholders. This term stands for negotiating land-use compromises within specific, locally and culturally defined regions in ways that reconcile economic, social and environmental requirements.</p><p>We must also consider long-distance interactions, of course. After all, rainforests are burned down in the global south to enable livestock farming in the global north. Distributive justice is important too, so we will need a new sense of solidarity spanning urban and rural communities internationally. Nothing less is needed than a new mindset everywhere. We have no time to lose. Let's go!</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["That land, however, must be reserved for natural ecosystems.

It's one of the bloc's most contentious issues, with member states, lobby groups and environmentalist all trying to sway the debate. Here's an overview.The European Union's common agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, with some \u20ac54 billion ($64 billion) in farming subsidies going to the bloc's 27 member states each year. Such a significant line item is guaranteed to be a source of much disagreement.As the EU sorts out its common budget for the 2021-2027 period, known as the multiannual financial framework, the CAP is set to undergo a major reform. </p><p>Though the amount of farming subsidies is expected to remain similar \u2014 about \u20ac390 billion until 2027 \u2014 it remains to be seen how the funds will be distributed, and whether funds will be linked to mandatory environmental policies. Read more: Opinion: EU fails to introduce real agricultural reformWhat is the CAP? The EU's common agricultural policy was launched in 1962 to ensure that postwar Europe would have enough food. It had five main goals:  improve agricultural productivity in Europe ensure a stable supply of affordable food stabilize European markets ensure that farmers could make a \"reasonable\" living ensure fair consumer prices As is the case for the rest of the budget, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers \u2014 in this case, the agricultural ministers of all 27 member states \u2014 must decide on the future of the CAP together.Read more: 'Eat less meat to help the climate' doesn't apply to everyone - here's whyHow does the EU currently distribute farming subsidies? The first pillar of the CAP comprises direct payments, which are calculated by hectare. Simply put: the larger the farm, the larger the subsidy.\u202fAccording to the German Environment Agency (UBA), direct payments account for, on average, about 40% of a farm's yearly income.But these direct payments have been criticized for contributing to the decline of smallholdings; farmers with smaller properties benefit considerably less from the EU's subsidies than industrial factory farms. According to the German Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Germany receives \u20ac6.2 billion in agricultural subsidies each year. Of this, \u20ac5 billion is direct payments. The remaining \u20ac1.2 billion \u2014 the CAP's second pillar \u2014 is put aside for rural development plans and measures relating to the climate and environment.The problem is that this second pillar is co-financed by member states. A country, region or municipality has to match any EU subsidy from the second pillar with the same amount from its own resources \u2014 which is why member states often don't apply for these funds.Read more:In Europe, climate change brings new crops, new ideas What's been the criticism of these subsidies?Large-scale industrial agriculture has often been blamed for contributing to biodiversity loss and growing CO2 emissions, and for polluting soil and water through the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Environment groups, climate activists and green political parties have criticized the CAP's direct payment-per-hectare system, accusing it of overwhelmingly promoting such practices.These payments generally aren't linked to schemes that benefit the environment. As it stands today, to receive subsidies farmers simply have to confirm the \"good agricultural and environmental conditions\" of their land, as well as fulfill the \"statutory management requirements,\" according to the European Commission.However, a new regulation was introduced in 2013 to ensure that a third of direct payments would only be released if certain \"greening\" measures had been put in place \u2014 that is, if farms meet certain environmental requirements. But Friends of the Earth Germany and other environmental groups have said this requirement doesn't go far enough. The German Environment Agency admitted in September that \"greening measures had not led to many operational changes and had hardly any positive effects from an environmental point of view.\"Read more:Could high-tech Netherlands-style farming feed the world? What reforms are necessary? The EU's agricultural policy must become more ecological and sustainable, and farmers should be rewarded for introducing measures that protect the environment \u2014 that's idea, anyway. However, there's been a long-running debate within the EU as to what percentage of direct payments should be linked to ecological measures in the years ahead.The European Commission has suggested that member states themselves should control the environmental measures, monitoring and sanctions \u2014 currently, these are stipulated by the EU. It also wants member states to send their policy plans to be approved by the European Commission. However, this proposal \u2014 backed on Wednesday by the bloc's 27 agriculture ministers \u2014 has been rejected by environmentalists, who think that member states would set the environmental bar too low, and agricultural lobby groups, who think the plan would unfairly distort competition between member states. The commission's proposed \"eco-schemes,\" which will be linked to first pillar payments and are expected to be much stricter than any previous measures, have also been contentious. Under the eco-schemes, 20% of the payments to farmers would be earmarked for green initiatives such as organic farming and agroforestry. A farm would only receive the full direct payment once it proves that it has fulfilled all the new environmental regulations, and wouldn't be able use the money for other purposes. The European Parliament, however, has backed a plan that would see this upped to 30% of payments.Read more: Vegan meat: The future of planet-saving plant-based eating What's been the reaction to the new plan?Environmentalists want the EU to go even further. Angelika Lischka, an agriculture expert with NABU, Germany's largest nature conservation NGO, told DW that organizations such as hers \"are calling for at least half of the direct payments in the first pillar to be linked with eco-schemes.\" But Joachim Rukwied, the head of the German Farmers' Association, has warned against maximizing the requirements \"linked exclusively to the environment.\" He said the EU needed to provide support for the agriculture sector to guarantee that all of the CAP's goals are met, including ensuring that farmers are able to earn a reasonable living. Environmental groups and the German Environment Agency (UBA) agree that the coming funding period should be used to completely overhaul the EU's agricultural policy, considering that the environmental damage caused by the sector is already a major problem. Lea K\u00f6der from the UBA told DW that Germany had already breached EU law by exceeding the limits set out in the bloc's Nitrates Directive, which aims to reduce water pollution from agricultural sources. \"We have to start reforming the system now, or it will only be possible to reach environmental goals with very expensive and drastic measures,\" she said.Read more: Farmers in Germany feel the heat of climate change </p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["However, this proposal \u2014 backed on Wednesday by the bloc's 27 agriculture ministers \u2014 has been rejected by environmentalists, who think that member states would set the environmental bar too low, and agricultural lobby groups, who think the plan would unfairly distort competition between member states.

Or whether Brexit could only worsen the state of affairs.In the hallowed halls of Westminster, the British government has been dreaming up a golden vision of sustainability for British agriculture post-Brexit.Despite positive hopes for this vision by the Soil Association, which certifies organic food in the United Kingdom and lobbies for sustainability, the group's policy officer Sam Packer is skeptical: \"The British government is seeing agriculture as an opportunity to tell a good story about Brexit.\"And this happy tale, like everything else to do with Brexit, is still up in the air.Read more: Will Brexit be bad for biodiversity in Britain?On the sustainability front, the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales (NFU) has teamed up with Greener UK (a coalition of environmental organizations, including The Soil Association) to make sure that Brexit works for farming and the environment.With agriculture a powerful force in the UK \u2014 farmers manage more than 70 percent of the land area in England and Wales, according to the NFU \u2014 such alliances could shift the equation, particularly when trade is on the table.Overthrowing the reign of CAPFar from minister's office in Westminster, on a windy hillside on the outskirts of Bristol, the enthusiasm for a brighter future has taken root with remain-voter Humphrey Lloyd.Lloyd is the grower at Edible Futures, a smallholding that sells greens and herbs to the local community. </p><p>He's also the treasurer at The Landworkers' Alliance, a union and campaign group representing the interests of small-scale and sustainable farmers.As he plants spring onions, Lloyd calls Brexit a \"unique political moment.\"The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has dominated agricultural payouts since before Lloyd was born in 1985. Those payments neglect smallholdings like his own. He wants to get in on the action.Packer, on the other hand, thinks that the UK's 25-year environment plan, launched earlier this year, is evidence that the status quo will win.He described the plan as including \"lots of rhetoric, lots of good words and very little binding action.\"Still, he sees as positive the fact that now change is inevitable, organizations like his are being invited to the table.Agroecology: The new buzzword At that table, the concepts of \"agroecology\" and \"agroforestry\" are being pushed into mainstream agriculture.Agroforestry involves using trees to prevent soil erosion, thus building up the health of the soil with organic matter that retains more water \u2014 and storing carbon from the atmosphere.Healthy soil is a mantra being picked up even in industrial farming. The UK government aims to make soils healthy by 2030.A bill including first-ever targets for soil health was introduced to parliament last March, and is expected to be published later in 2018.Sustainability laggard BritainFor Ped Asgarian, the manager of organic outfit The Community Farm in Somerset, Brexit certainly will not be the bright gate to a green future.While sitting at a busy pub in Chew Magna, in the south of England, he notes with irony that as Europe has sought to become more environmentally oriented for years, \"the one nation that has been really holding them back is us.\"He sees the EU as forcing sustainability onto the UK \"because our soil is vanishing fast, our biodiversity is vanishing fast, and our soil health is degrading so much.\"Read more: Soil: More than just dirtPacker agrees that Britain could just as easily have made changes from within the EU \u2014 such as localizing food systems and moving away from industrial farming, including from the import-export methods upon which it currently relies.France, for example, recently announced a commitment for 50 percent of food supplied to the public sector to be produced locally.\"The message that we can achieve more outside [the EU] can, in some ways, be unpicked through that story,\" Packer points out.The realities of eating local Eating locally grown produce is not an easy prospect, given the cool UK climate.Asgarian, who runs a box scheme selling fruit and vegetables to 450 local households a week, notes that not everything in the box comes from the farm's 22 acres (8 hectares). They grow about 30 percent of what they sell, and rely upon a network of other local growers.\"We also work with a couple of larger farms in the north and east of England, because getting enough produce year-round is quite difficult,\" he says.They even have to import some items to keep their customers satisfied.Read more: Would you eat local for a week? I tried, and discovered what eating green really meansNor can the UK rely solely on domestic sales. Currently, it exports 40 percent of its lamb, 80 percent of its dairy and 75 percent of its wheat and barley to the EU.This is why groups like the NFU have been pushing for tariff-free and frictionless trade to continue.Despite all the challenges, people like Lloyd continue dreaming.\"The history of political change is the history of hopeful people doing what they can,\" he says as he makes drills for his next line of onions. \"We need to hope, we need to work hard and we need to believe.\"Lloyd continues to be convinced that \"we can win quite a simple battle against corporate industrial agriculture in favor of something sustainable and fair.\" </p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["He described the plan as including \"lots of rhetoric, lots of good words and very little binding action.

Leaders from the Amazon region, Congo and Indonesia, among others, are unifying their voices in demanding greater respect and support for their communities, which they believe to be key actors in the fight to protect our planet.The Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA) is one of the main indigenous organizations present at CoP13. Its members believe implementing an indigenous economy model is the only way to ensure a sustainable future. DW talked to COICA's delegate at CoP13 to find out more.DW: What do you expect from CoP13?</p><p>Henderson Rengifo: Being aware that we have taken care of our forests since ancestral times, it is very important for us to discuss its biological diversity. Governmental measures through the years have endangered our forests and biodiversity, and at the same time, are putting all of humankind at risk.We are here in Canc\u00fan to show that indigenous communities want to protect their natural resources and their biodiversity, which is essential for life on Earth. We want to impress upon governments that any decision-making on public policies must recognize and take into account indigenous peoples' proposals, in order to promote sustainable development.Why is the role of indigenous people in protecting biodiversity so important?Indigenous communities have always respected the law of nature, the life of all beings and the great biological diversity that exists in their territories.Every being and every part of the forest plays a very important role in regulating life in it, and only by caring for all of nature can we insure a safe future for the next generations. COICA has helped organized the third Global Canoe action to highlight the importance of indigenous people and local communities in protecting biodiversity. The action is promoted with the phrase, \"Indigenous peoples ... have solutions to combat climate change that work.\"What are these \"solutions that work\" to combat climate change?In Peru alone, 15 million hectares of forest are legally recognized as being indigenous territories, although many more are without recognition. In these territories, we work to create an alternative way of caring for forests, thus helping cool the global warming crisis. Protecting forests is the best solution to fighting climate change.How does this work?We not only protect forests, but also manage them properly. We support an indigenous economy based on responsible and sustainable management of resources over time, for instance through agroforestry and harvest of wood.National economic policies are normally only based on extractive activities such as oil, gas, mining or palm-oil projects that threaten our forests. Governments are not providing real alternatives for indigenous people to manage their forests by adding value to the forests' own resources.The indigenous economy is based on traditional indigenous knowledge and values, promoting solidarity over consumerism. It supports non-extractive activities such as agroforestry, bio-industries, aquaculture, community tourism and handicrafts.Could the indigenous economy be implemented at a global scale?No, because it is not an economy of scale - but it can help make big changes. We are on the right path, and indigenous people have proposals that will contribute to minimizing and mitigating climate problems. These proposals can also help states plan sustainable development.If everyone would adopt our way of life, we could fight against climate change - but for that, we have to manage forests sustainably.Henderson Rengifo is the president of AIDESEP, Peru's largest federation of indigenous Amazon communities.

The German government supports the protected areas financially.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The allegations are not new: in 2016, the non-governmental organisation Survival International submitted a formal complaint to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) against the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) over alleged human rights violations by park rangers ('eco-guards').</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A research team of the Centre for Rural Development's postgraduate programme at Humboldt University Berlin spent three months in Cameroon last year to explore governance challenges of Lob\u00e9k\u00e9 National Park. The conflict between eco-guards and local communities were also an issue on site.</p><p>Community members reproached eco-guards with allegations of abuse. Remarkably, most interlocutors stated that they had not experienced direct violence by eco-guards themselves but based their claims on the accounts of others. However, reported incidents of direct violence have created an atmosphere of fear and apprehension. The eco-guards, too, reported feeling unsafe during their patrols. According to a young ranger their job is essentially a matter of life and death: 'If I confiscate a weapon today, it is not the weapon that will kill me tomorrow.'</p><p>The following factors aggravate the conflict:</p><p> The complaint mechanism set up in 2014 by WWF and the local NGO CEFAID to report human rights abuses by eco-guards is ineffective: Local people do not know of the mechanism's existence.</p><p> Safari companies have taken over law enforcement in the park's buffer zone and cooperate with the Cameroonian military \u2013 without the involvement of trained eco-guards. According to accounts of local communities, the military regularly resorts to violence and prevents locals from accessing their agroforestry zones.</p><p> The Cameroonian state neglects its eco-guards: The difficult working conditions cause a lot of frustration for the rangers. It is plausible that the eco-guards' frustration negatively influences their behaviour.</p><p>The international attention on rights abuses in protected areas is welcome. But: the single focus on the conflict between eco-guards and local population appears misguided. It does not represent the biggest issues on the ground.</p><p>Protected areas are surrounded by so-called 'buffer zones'. In Lob\u00e9k\u00e9's buffer zone, concessions of private companies overlap with local communities' agricultural zones. The resulting legal uncertainty primarily benefits the more powerful safari, timber and mining companies, which severely restrict the access and usage rights of the local population. The restrictions that these concessions impose are hardly considered in the current media debate.</p><p>Furthermore, the conflict between eco-guards and local population is a symptom of a larger conflict: conservation is understood as antagonistic to socio-economic development. That is hardly surprising. The local population is extremely poor and depends on local resource use and hunting to survive. Both, however, are severely restricted. In addition, the state of Cameroon is largely absent in the park's buffer zone, with little public investment in basic infrastructure like schools, hospitals and water supply. Most interviewees hold the park management accountable for covering their basic needs. The park management, however, is unable to cope with these high expectations, exacerbating the conflict between park authorities and local communities.</p><p>In light of the challenges, many call for an immediate stop to donor funding.

Advisor Vijay Kumar Thallam elaborated the approach in an e-mail interview with Sabine Balk and Hans Dembowski.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why is organic farming so important for India and other developing countries?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our planet is facing dramatic environmental change. We are now living in the sixth mass extinction, and it is a result of human activity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that we must urgently change land-management patterns internationally (see Katja Dombrowski in Monitor section of D+C/E+Z e-paper 2019/09). Otherwise, average temperatures will rise more than 1.5 degrees - with dire consequences. Smallholder farmers and their families as well as landless agriculture workers are the least responsible for the climate crisis, but they face the gravest consequences. Rainfall is becoming ever more erratic. Dry spells and drought are worsening. Ground water is being depleted. Unseasonal rains and heavy storms are causes of concern too. Crop failure is becoming ever more likely. All countries therefore need solutions that ensure land is not degraded, soils are not eroded and farmers do not become distressed. One option is Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), our form of organic farming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What exactly is ZBNF?</p><p>ZBNF promotes poly-cropping, the simultaneous cultivation of several useful plants. 'Zero budget' means that the costs for the main crop are recovered from the other crops. 'Zero budget' also means that this kind of 'natural farming' does not require expensive external inputs. All inputs needed are generated on the farm itself. Our regenerative agriculture with holistic land-management practices relies on the powers of nature. ZBNF was pioneered by Subhash Palekar, a charismatic rural farmers' leader who has been advocating this for more than 20 years. It also builds on the work of many other eminent persons. The four principles - or 'wheels' as we say - are:</p><p>Beejamrutham: microbial seed coating through cow urine and cow dung-based formulations.</p><p>Jeevamrutham: enhancing soil microbiome through application of an inoculum made from uncontaminated soil, cow dung, cow urine and other local ingredients.</p><p>Achhadana (mulching): keeping the ground covered by cover crops and crop residues all year.</p><p>Waaphasa: build-up of soil humus with enhanced soil porosity and soil aeration.</p><p>Pest management is important too, of course, and ZBNF uses natural resources such as cow dung, cow urine, botanical extracts et cetera. Moreover, inter-cropping and poly-cropping, including trees, also help to manage pests. We do not use synthetic chemicals at all.</p><p>But wouldn't high-tech high-yield approaches be more profitable?</p><p>Well, we must first define what that term means. Nature is actually a very sophisticated and highly productive system. The complex networks of microbial populations below the ground are drivers of plant growth. For instance, about 25,000 kilometres of fungal hyphae are estimated to exist in a mere cubic meter of healthy soil. The hyphae have an important role in the exchange of nutrients. If chemical fertilisers and pesticides are applied, these networks are destroyed. A real high-tech approach must therefore build on a proper understanding of nature. The farmers are experimenting all the time, their knowledge is evidence-based. Hence, I see respecting their knowledge as 'high tech'. The guiding question is not just how much we can grow in one season but how much longer can we have green growth in a year.</p><p>Is your method feasible on all farms?</p><p>In Andhra Pradesh, we work with all types of farms - subsistence farms, small holdings and large farms. However, most of the 572,000 farmers enrolled in our ZBNF programme are subsistence farmers or smallholders with less than 0.8 hectares. Only 11?% have more than 1.6 hectares.</p><p>Can ZBNF feed India or indeed the world?</p><p>Yes, it can. Our experience shows that ZBNF crop yields do not decline over time. Mulching with a 365-day green cover actually intensifies farming in a sustainable way. The point is to keep even rain-fed lands covered with live crops all year long. By contrast, the current industrial agriculture system has undermined food security, not least because nutrition values have dramatically declined.</p><p>Have scientists tested the validity of your approach?</p><p>Well, in my eyes, the farmers themselves are the greatest researchers. They see season for season what works and what does not. However, we have also cooperated with academic research institutes:</p><p>The Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS) in Hyderabad is conducting socio-economic impact assessments.</p><p>The Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) is evaluating the impact of ZBNF on soil fertility, water-holding capacity, biodiversity et cetera. They are also evaluating performance and impacts.</p><p>Scientists from the University of Reading in the UK are studying the impacts of ZBNF on soils and crop growth.</p><p>The Bangalore-based think tank</p><p>C-STEP (Centre for the Study of Science, Technology and Policy) is assessing how ZBNF reduces water and energy consumption.</p><p>The Delhi-based think tank CEEW (Council on Energy, Environment and Water) is checking what ZBNF does in regard to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as what this approach can contribute to reducing fertiliser-subsidy expenditure.</p><p>How do you reach out to new farmers?</p><p>To fully transition to ZBNF, a village needs support for up to seven years, and individual farmers require up to five years. To spread the information, we rely on community resource persons (CRPs). These men and women have made the transition, performed particularly well and have been trained to teach others. They typically coach other farmers in neighbouring villages, where, after two to three years, new pools of CRPs can be identified. This peer-to-peer approach is very effective. What also matters is that all field officers of the State Agriculture Department are trained in ZBNF and are held responsible for supporting the CRPs.</p><p>Why is the empowerment of rural women an important dimension of ZBNF?</p><p>Women do a large share of the farm work. They till the land, rear cattle and other ruminants. They contribute labour for all farm activities, including sowing, weeding, harvesting, watering et cetera. At the same time, they are agents of change. Teaching a woman is akin to teaching a family. Any farming discourse is incomplete unless men and women of the household are involved. Women's self-help groups, moreover, are very important for reaching out to new farms. In rural Andhra, some 7.5 million women are organised in about 730,000 self-help groups (SHGs). They can now mobilise many more people. This movement started two decades ago, basically as savings and credit groups. They are well networked and campaign for social change, health issues, livelihoods et cetera. The SHGs and their federations have become a transformative force. To a very large extent, ZBNF fits their goals, and accordingly, they have become important promotors of our approach. Many of our CRPs belong to this network. They understand the negative implications of chemical food for the health of their families and the adverse effect agrochemicals have on the soil.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["They see season for season what works and what does not.

Smallholder farmers along the Upper Tana River basin are now investing in bamboo trees to curb floods.Many of the Kenyan communities affected by floods and landslides this year were already struggling to recover from the 2017 drought - a result a failed rainy season in 2016 and unusually high temperatures.\"The rainfall patterns have completely shifted. We are receiving more torrential rains of high intensity, accompanied by flooding,\" Catherine Muthuri, a research scientist at the World Agroforestry Center in Nairobi, told DW.Degraded soils vulnerable to erosion reduce soil fertility in farmlands and decrease yields, thus intensifying hunger and poverty. Additionally, floods wash away massive amounts of sediment into the rivers.Smallholder farmers along the Upper Tana River basin in central Kenya have turned to bamboo trees in a bid to reduce sediments flowing into rivers, repair the riparian areas alongside the rivers and stabilize land that is prone to landslides.\"We are promoting bamboo trees in flood and landslide-prone areas to help stabilize the soils. </p><p>We aim to help restore and repair the riparian [areas] already destroyed by floods, and reduce sedimentation flowing into the rivers,\" said Anthony Kariuki, general manager of the Nairobi Water Fund.Protecting soil and waterThe Upper Tana River basin covers approximately 17,000 square kilometers (4,200,785 acres) and is of critical importance to the Kenyan economy. Home to 5.3 million people, its water provides half of the country's hydropower output. It supplies 95 percent of Nairobi city's water, according to the Nairobi Water Fund. Kariuki clarified that a bamboo-rooting system helps retains water in the ground, binds the soils and helps filter out sediments, thereby reducing the amount of sediments that flow into the rivers downstream.\"Bamboo covers the soil through its canopy, reducing evaporation, hence rehabilitating highly degraded areas faster. Depending on the species it forms a canopy (shelter) within the first four years compared to other trees that can take about 15 to 30 years,\" Peter Kung'u, who is in charge of bamboo propagation at the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), told DW.Read more: Trees with tricks in their trunksThe International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) highlights bamboo as a core development resource that can help create a wealth of practical solutions while reducing the negative effects that changing climate patterns have on millions of rural communities.INBAR says bamboo is critical in building climate resilient communities and can help the poor control flooding while protecting the environment, biodiversity and the ecosystem.A 'woody grass'Of the more than 1,400 different species of bamboo trees found globally, about 14 species are found in Africa, according to Kung'u. While three are found in mainland Africa, 11 species are located on the island of Madagascar. Bamboo has existed for hundreds of years in Asia, Latin America and parts of Africa.Known as \"the wonder grass,\" bamboo is a fast growing woody grass naturally found in diverse climates. Plants usually grow three to five feet (0.9 to 1.5 meters) high annually. Their stems range from one mm to 30 cm (11.8 inches) which is why they are sometimes called \"bamboo trees.\" After harvesting, new shoots appear from the roots every year. In four to five years, these shoots grow to harvestable size.\"Bamboo plays a valuable environmental role. Its complex root system acts as an efficient water filter, removing nutrients and dangerous poisons such as heavy metals before they get into the food chain,\" Kung'u said.\"Additionally, its ability to grow faster than many hardwoods makes bamboo ideal for absorbing greenhouse gases [such as carbon dioxide], compacting desertification and global warming,\" he added. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important heat-trapping gas, released through human activities such as deforestation, and the burning of fossil fuels.In 2015, the Paris Agreement formally recognized the key role played by landscapes and resilient forests in reducing the global average temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Farmers need to see the benefitsWhile research scientist Muthuri agrees that bamboo is one of the plant species that can help tackle climate change, she underlines the need to combine it with other crops.\"Bamboo is attractive to rehabilitate areas that are deforested. We have a wide range of species, adaptable to every place, but it's not a one fit situation,\" Muthuri warns. \"They take time to establish but once established they take very little time to grow.\"Muthuri sees bamboo's potential along river banks and farm borders as a buffer and water filter \"but it's not an attractive species for the farmlands unless [there is an] economic incentive for the farmers.\"Smallholder farmers along the Upper Tana Basin have planted about 65,000 bamboo seedlings since last year across the watershed, according to Kariuki.The Nairobi Water Fund is training them in bamboo-farming practices and linking them to markets \"as an incentive to improve their economic livelihoods through selling bamboo products such as firewood, charcoal, animal feeds, building and fencing materials.\"This comes after Kenya issued a logging ban for its forests earlier this year.

The key to success is the participatory approach that empowers marginalised villagers to take their fate into their own hands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Natural landscapes are deteriorating worldwide. Approximately 30?% of the world's natural forests are expected to be lost by the end of this century. Furthermore, 25?% of all land on earth is currently threatened by desertification. The implications are severe soil erosion, reduced agricultural productivity, food insecurity and the dwindling of biodiversity.</p><p>Morocco is no exception. Over 90?% of Morocco's historical forest cover has already been destroyed. The reasons are overexploitation, overgrazing and the worsening climate. The disastrous extent of Morocco's environmental degradation puts at risk the country's flora and fauna. Over 223 plant and animal species in Morocco are endangered, according to the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the umbrella organisation of government agencies and non-governmental organisations.</p><p>Severe erosion, water run-off, floods and soil depletion have harsh impacts on human well-being too. That is particularly true in the Atlas region, where communities' livelihoods depend on natural resources. The people concerned are socially marginalised and live in systemic poverty.</p><p>In this stressful scenario, environmental conservation is an important development issue. The political objective must be to mitigate all destructive trends. Accordingly, a wide range of projects has been started to provide communities with the twin goals of giving them control over their natural resources and generating socioeconomic benefits. However, it can be challenging to tackle environmental and societal issues at once. Many projects have failed to achieve either their conservation or their developmental goals \u2013 and some have not achieved either.</p><p>It is therefore essential to identify effective practices and share the lessons learned. The High Atlas Foundation (HAF), a non-profit organisation that is registered in Morocco and the USA, runs a pro-poor agroforestry programme in the North African country. On behalf of the HAF, I have assessed it, using a new methodology that allowed me to analyse the links between conservation management and community interventions as well as what they mean in terms of poverty reduction and biodiversity improvements.</p><p>My work included the desk-based review of relevant documents, 34 interviews plus discussions with six focus groups that involved seven staff members and 26 beneficiaries. The data was compiled in a booklet, upon which a group of independent professionals relied to score the performance of the programme, determine which practices were successful, identify gaps and give recommendations for further improvement. The evaluation revealed that the programme was highly effective and should serve as an international model.</p><p>Since 2003, HAF has planted 3.6 million seeds and trees. As strong increase occurred in 2018. The reason was that four new nurseries were established in partnership with Morocco's High Commission of Water and Forests and Ecosia, a social business based in Berlin.</p><p>One successful intervention was to distribute fruit trees. As a result, subsistence farms that cultivated barley and corn started to sell surplus organic fruit, considerably improving peoples livelihoods. There are environmental benefits too as the trees reduce both soil erosion and flooding. The cultivation of fruit trees thus helps to preserve the natural environment.</p><p>Soil quality and plant regeneration are very important, given that erosion and desertification are imminent threats, which are exacerbated by farming of staple food and cattle herding. One farmer observed: 'Previously, we only grew barley and corn, and the soil deteriorated fast, so erosion took away our land. Now the trees prevent this from happening. We also have more bees because bees love the blossoms.'</p><p>The difference cherry trees make</p><p>In the Tifnoute Valley of the Taroudant province, for example, the foundation distributed 10 to 100 cherry trees per farmer. Skills training was offered accordingly. The annual revenue per tree amounts to the equivalent of $?21 to $?105, depending on water availability, harshness of winters and other factors. On average, the revenues from cherry sales are ten times as much as farmers were able to earn from barley and corn.</p><p>All in all, HAF was able to improve the incomes of approximately 10,000 households. One farmer stated: 'Before we cultivated cherries, we had to work hard to grow corn and barley. If I counted everything together and sold all the barley and corn without keeping anything for myself, I only gained $?53 a year. A few years after the foundation gave me trees I was able to sell the fruits for $?528 to $?1,055 depending on how much my trees produced. With the income generated, I improved my family's life.'</p><p>Higher incomes enabled communities to reinvest some of the money in communal infrastructure, including schools, health facilities or youth enterprises. Key to this success was the foundation's holistic strategy to meaningfully engage the local communities. Villagers are involved in every single step. They are entrusted with the authority to make decisions and increasingly become agents of change.</p><p>Involving the people ensures early community buy-in, prevents programmes from being driven by external interests and ensures a thorough understanding of the local context. Furthermore, HAF addresses poverty from all angles by running workshops to empower women, train skills, promote literacy et cetera. HAF acknowledges that poverty does not simply mean shortfalls of income or food. Other symptoms include the lack of access to education and opportunities in general. Empowerment is therefore the means to reduce inequality.</p><p>One woman said: 'This tree and plant nursery changed our lives. Before, we were expected to stay at home. Thanks to the help of the foundation we are able to work in the nursery, learn new skills, earn our own money and help to provide for our families. This makes our life much easier, and men are starting to respect us. We are very proud of what we do even when we encounter problems. We learned how to face the problems together, search for solutions and keep going.'</p><p>The HAF has proven that meaningful community engagement through participatory methods is essential to sustainable, long-term success. Community engagement should never be an afterthought or rhetorical, but should be fundamentally integrated into every conservation and development project. The HAF is happy to share information and experience with interested parties internationally.</p><p>A farmer concluded: 'I have great expectations for the future.

A key challenge is to generate sufficient biomass for organic soil management in semi arid areas. Specific action to support the enhancement of degraded soils is needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To safeguard its own viability and feed the continent's growing population, Africa's smallholder agriculture needs much higher yields per hectare. At the same time, it must become more resilient to climate change and manage the natural resources more sustainable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To date, conventional farm inputs such as high-yielding seed, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are not sufficiently made available to African smallholders, and all to often, they cannot afford what is on offer. Input use, moreover, involves inherent economic, environmental and health risks due to price volatility, climate impacts and lack of know-how. Accordingly, more domestically produced, organic fertilisers - such as manure, compost, mulch or cover crops - must be used.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It also matters that Africa's natural resources are being depleted fast - faster than in any other continent. All natural resources like fertile soils, water, biodiversity, forests and pasture lands are affected here. Therefore, soil rehabilitation and sustainable resource management must be key priorities, apart from improving agricultural productivity.</p><p>Environmentally sustainable management</p><p>Development debate is currently focusing on several environmentally sustainable management systems for agriculture, which result in increased yields per hectare at the same time. The most discussed approaches in Africa are:</p><p>- sustainable intensification (SI),</p><p>- conservation agriculture (CA), and</p><p>- climate smart agriculture (CSA).</p><p>- In this essay, I will only consider the challenges they imply for small-scale farms.</p><p>- SI (Garnett, Charles, Godfray 2012) is only very vaguely defined as yields being increased \"without adverse environmental impact and without the cultivation of more land\", but the terms CSA and CA are defined a little more precisely by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 2013, 2014). Each of these concepts has three pillars. CSA aims at:</p><p>- increasing incomes,</p><p>- adapting to climate change and</p><p>- reducing greenhouse gases.</p><p>CA is specified as:</p><p>- minimum tillage/abstaining from using the plough,</p><p>- constant soil cover and</p><p>- crop rotation.</p><p>In principle, all approaches serve global needs, and they can be customised to specific regions. All ecologically sustainable systems aim to enhance the use of local inputs and stop or reduce the use of external inputs, such as mineral fertilisers or at least make their use more efficient for environmental as well as economic reasons. For achieving this, it is pivotal to boost the soil's natural fertility by increasing its share of humus. This can be only done by enriching the soil with organic matter.</p><p>Organic soils are very useful in terms of adapting to climate change, moreover. They have a great buffer capacity concerning droughts and floods and withstand erosion. A side effect, moreover, helps to mitigate climate change because organic matter contains a lot of carbon. Soils are thus sequestration sinks for greenhouse gases.</p><p>The sustainable management approaches differ in their varying emphasis on individual elements. CA focuses on soil protection, especially by not using the plough. CSA focuses on adapting to climate change profitably, for instance by mulching; SI uses compost in order to reduce the need for mineral fertilisers. In practise, however, all the three approaches are often the same and serve to enrich the soil's organic matter content.</p><p>Certification, yes or no?</p><p>There is no monitoring or certification system for the above-mentioned sustainable management approaches, so the smallholders concerned cannot demand higher prices for their products. Since one should not create a niche market for rich people in countries, where hunger and poverty are widespread, this scenario makes sense.</p><p>Without certification, however, there is no price incentive for small farmers to adopt sustainable farming methods. They will only adopt them if they are personally convinced, have other economic reasons or because they are involved in a project or support programme. This means there is a risk of sustainable methods being gradually abandoned, for example, as subsidies expire. Such dilution has indeed been observed in CA and CSA programmes and is subject of critical public debate.</p><p>In contrast, organic farming (OF) is the only method for which there are clear guidelines. Originally, the paramount goal was to produce healthy food free from chemical residues. But environmental awareness also mattered, and it still does. Organic farming is primarily about closing nutrient cycles, so the use of mineral fertilisers and pesticides is ruled out. OF associations monitor compliance. In turn, certification allows for higher prices than are paid for conventionally produced food stuff. However, in Europe the yields of organic farms are around 20% lower on average than those of conventional ones. Higher prices make up for this yield difference.</p><p>In Africa, the prevalence of certified organic farming is still very low, only amounting to about 0.1% (Hesse et al. 2009). It is almost exclusively limited to export production, because it can be monitored and certified, so European consumers will be willing to pay higher prices.</p><p>Whether organic farming is an option even without certification for Africa's domestic markets is being discussed. On the upside, the yield differences between conventional and organic farming are smaller or even non-existent in Africa. Sometimes - and especially if the conventional reference system is weak, OF even leads to higher yields at lower costs (De Ponti 2012), so OF could be more profitable for small-scale farmers even if their goods do not fetch higher prices than those of conventional farms. Certification would become irrelevant.</p><p>Obstacles for organic farming</p><p>If this is so, then why is OF not much more popular in Africa? There actually are a number of obstacles. All sustainable cultivation systems essentially rest upon the build-up of organic matter in soils. Organic farming traditionally includes the utilisation of animal manure. In regions where cattle are hardly held, green manure, mulching, trees planting for agroforestry systems or composting can serve the purpose.</p><p>Building up organic matter is not simple however. It requires precipitation, because biomass is only built up when it rains. This is a huge challenge in many African regions with only one short rainy season. In temperate zones rainfall is spread over more time, so crops especially grown for enriching the soil fertility and ploughing under can be grown right after the main crop. This is not feasible in many African regions where short rains only allow for one crop per season. For these regions, another option is to plant trees and practise agroforestry. But to do this properly, one needs appropriate seeds, planting stocks, know-how and labour capacity, all of which tend to be in short supply. Moreover, the investment costs are quite high.</p><p>In Africa, animal manure typically accrues in too small quantities. Most farms only hold a few small ruminants, such as goats and sheeps, which are mostly kept without stables, so the manure would have to be collected all the time. Moroeover, farmers often lack means of transport, so they would have to distribute the manure manually on the fields, which takes a lot of time. In quantitative terms, it would be much better to apply bovine manure. However, only pastoralists, who do not belong to the same ethinic groups as the farmers, hold cattle in relevant numbers, and their relationship to farmers is mostly competitive. Reestablishing win-win situations in which crop farmers and pastoralists benefit from each others' manure and plant residues would make sense, but it is very hard to do in the present political situation, in which tensions between different ethnic groups are growing.</p><p>Know-how and innovations</p><p>To sum up, all sustainable farming methods are hard to implement in sub-Saharan Africa - whether with or without certification. Often, additional labour will be needed, and innovations are necessary. Support is needed at several levels:</p><p>- suitable agricultural policies must foster sustainable land-management approaches and offer agricultural extension services that are competent in ecologically suistainable land management practises,</p><p>- research is still needed to identify the most suitable approaches for smallholders in different agro-ecological regions,</p><p>- loans and credits must be made available for means to transport manure and compost,</p><p>- farmers need devices for minimum tillage (as a substitute for the plough) and for mechanised weed control or even, in breach of orthodoxy, herbicides so they can reduce manual labour intensity,</p><p>- subsidies are needed for the acquisition of suitable seed (plant varieties and tree species), and</p><p>- targeted subsidies (e-vouchers) must promote soil enhancement.</p><p>In particular in places where soils are already degraded, sustainable methods will not be adopted widely unless they are supported by an appropriate agricultural policy. Ultimately, how strictly the systems are adhered to is only of secondary concern.

In this connection, Lenzing donated a total of USD  27,000 to the Canopy project for its ongoing tree planting program.  With this amount, Lenzing completes Earth Day Networks ambitious  target of raising USD 150,000 for Earth Day 2017  (earthday.org/trees). The United Nations estimate that for every  dollar spent on reforestation, USD 2.50 is generated in local  downstream income and benefits.</p><p>\"Were very grateful for Lenzing Groups generous donation\", said  Earth Day Network president Kathleen Rogers. \"With the help of  partners such as Lenzing, were not just planting trees, were also  helping build sustainable communities in areas of the world most in  need of reforestation.\"</p><p>The new sustainability strategy ,,Naturally Positive\" of the Lenzing  Group is the result of the new Group strategy sCore TEN adopted in  the autumn of 2015. \"The concept of sustainability is an integral  feature of our Group strategy. This is because Lenzing is in the  unique position to be able to operate a truly circular business  model. We produce functional, aesthetic and emotional products by  utilizing the raw material wood from CO2 and sunlight\", says Stefan  Doboczky, Chief Executive Officer of the Lenzing Group. \"At the end  of their useful lives, our fibers are biodegradable and thus once  again serve as the basis for new plant growth.\"</p><p>This model of the circular economy pervades the entire Lenzing  sustainability strategy. It is based on the three \"P\" cornerstones,  People - Planet - Profit. Crucial operational components being  implemented include the sustainable procurement of wood and a  responsible handling of water. The raw material wood is completely  converted into valuable industrial raw materials and bioenergy at the biorefineries of the Lenzing Group. Largely closed chemical cycles  ensure the environmentally compatible production of LenzingTM fibers. Accordingly, more than 99 percent of the solvent used to manufacture  TENCEL\u00ae fibers is recovered.</p><p>Other key aspects of the sustainability strategy applied by Lenzing  are the decarbonization of production for the sake of improved  climate protection as well as the promotion of sustainable  innovations designed to replace resource- intensive, environmentally  harmful products. Maintaining the required innovative strength is  also a crucial element of the Group strategy sCore TEN.</p><p>This approach is complemented by a close cooperation with the value  chain in order to jointly develop and implement systemic solutions.  \"That is why we closely work together with multi-stakeholder  initiatives and actively support a range of NGOs devoted to  propagating sustainability principles\", states Robert van de Kerkhof, Chief Commercial Officer of the Lenzing Group. \"With this in mind, we are pursuing a policy oriented towards the long term which features  transparency and mutual trust with all our stakeholders.\"</p><p>Effective immediately, the \"net benefit principle\" comprises the new  parameter Lenzing has introduced as an internal benchmark. It enables an objective assessment of products. The principle measures whether  the product contributes added value to the environment and society as well as to Lenzings partners. In this regard, the additional benefit considered over the products entire life cycle must be considerably  higher than other alternatives available on the marketplace. Examples of \"net benefit\" products manufactured by Lenzing are TENCEL\u00ae fibers, Modal COLOR\u00ae fibers or the new Refibra(TM) fibers made from recycled  cotton scraps.</p><p>The new sustainability strategy is described in detail in the newly  published Sustainability Report 2016, which is available now for  downloading on the Lenzing Website  (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lenzing.com/sustainability-reports\">http://www.lenzing.com/sustainability-reports</url>).</p><p>Canopy Project Through the Canopy Project, Earth Day Network works on the ground with organizations worldwide that strengthen communities  through tree planting.

Are the small producers, for example, advancing effectively towards greater sustainability?</p><p>First, we must start by looking at the context. In terms of productivity gains, it is worth recalling that for the same amount of vegetable oil produced, oil palm needs eight to 10 times less surface area than other perennial oilseed crops.</p><p>The direct consequence is that because it requires less space, the cultivation of oil palm allows small producers to preserve more natural areas, and therefore, more biodiversity.</p><p>Then, if one focuses on the plantation itself compared to other crops, it is clear that oil palm hosts more biodiversity. As a tree plant, it creates a habitat for dozens of plant and animal species. Epiphytic plants develop there harmoniously and many insects (ants, etc) find an environment there, which is favourable to their development. This is far more biodiverse than crops such as soy or canola.</p><p>There have been numerous studies examining biodiversity on oil palm plantations.</p><p>In Africa, for example, it has been well documented that oil palm provides edible resources for: chimpanzee species, Thomas\u2019s rope squirrels, white-throated bee-eaters (Merops albicollis), southern yellow-billed hornbills and oil palm vultures.</p><p>In Latin America, black vultures (Coragyps stratus) and white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) are among the species living around and within oil palm plantations.</p><p>In Southeast Asia, the plant also provides a range of uses and habitats.</p><p>According to one study in Sumatra, 38 non-domesticated mammals were found using oil palm plantations.</p><p>The report also noted that almost two-thirds of these have an important conservation value or are protected under national law, and 25 per cent are listed as vulnerable or higher on International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red lists.</p><p>A study on the Malaysian peninsula suggested a thriving population of the banded pig (Sus scrofa vittatus).

RSPO\u2019s Principles and Criteria for example, pay significant attention to the preservation of biodiversity and natural resources (land, energy, air, water).</p><p>Soil cover by leguminous plants and the planting ban on slopes that are too steep, limiting erosion and soil destruction, are examples. The use of biofuels (shells and fibre from the processing itself) to produce electricity and steam, limits the use of fossil fuels to a minimum.</p><p>Oil palm plantations need few pesticides and chemical fertilisers to be healthy and profitable. In addition, farmers have developed integrated pest management techniques (pheromones to trap insects, creating attractive hedges and bushes that can serve as habitat for pest predators, maintaining an owl nest every 25ha to promote the circulation of birds of prey that feed on rats, etc).</p><p>Thus, oil production helps protect surface water and groundwater resources.</p><p>High efficiency levels allow the industry to focus on productivity in small areas, a culture that is naturally home to many species, with strict protective measures implemented by the sector.</p><p>I\u2019ll be visiting Malaysia to conduct further field research on the biodiversity in oil palm plantations, and the wider environmental conservation efforts undertaken in the country.

At the same time, it could actually sequester more greenhouse gases than it emits. Demanding that agriculture become climate-neutral is therefore realistic and - considering global heating - even necessary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the IAASTD (International Assessment of Agriculture Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development), the food sector, including all its upstream and downstream industries, generates up to 37?% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. A significant share of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, 44?% and 82?% respectively, results from agriculture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is very difficult to make reliable calculations in this sector. For the purpose of this essay, however, precise figures are not essential. What matters is the general outlook.</p><p>On the one hand, enormous quantities of carbon can potentially be sequestered by photosynthesis and by organic matter in the soil. This phenomenon is called 'negative emissions'. On the other, such emissions can be released again at any time as 'positive emissions' through harvesting, ploughing, deforestation, fertilisers and digestion.</p><p>Some farming practices maximise negative emissions in the long run. That is desirable and it also distinguishes industrial from climate-friendly cultivation.</p><p>Humus-rich soil and forests can endure for centuries. They are permanent CO2 sinks. Among others, this mechanism should be used to gain the time needed to reduce to zero the emissions of the entire world economy (see also Katja Dombrowski's essay on the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land in D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2019/09, Monitor).</p><p>The conversion of forests and natural areas into arable land currently causes most of agriculture's greenhouse-gas emissions. In second place are methane emissions from cattle farming and wet rice cultivation. In crop cultivation, the most important emissions result from the production and use of mineral nitrogen fertiliser.</p><p>Organic fertiliser matters too. When used to boost plant growth, excrements generate negative emissions, since they ensure the plants' nutrient supply and enrich the soil with organic matter. If the fertiliser is used, however, it emits greenhouse gases through volatilisation, erosion and decomposition.</p><p>The following basic guidelines are important for limiting emissions caused by land-use changes:</p><p>As many forests and other ecosystems as possible must continue to serve as carbon sinks and fulfil other vital functions. Accordingly, existing fields must not only be farmed in a more sustainable way. Their productivity must be maximised as well.</p><p>Arable land is used to grow either food for people or animal fodder and raw materials for bioenergy. Ever more land is being used for that latter purposes. Since the global population is increasing, we must not allow human meat consumption to grow without limit. Otherwise, the climate will take more harm.</p><p>The demand for greater agricultural productivity does not mean that more and more inputs are needed. Indeed, inputs can and must be reduced. The following goals and principles should guide the sustainable reorientation of agriculture:</p><p>It is possible and necessary to provide everyone with an adequate supply of healthy food.</p><p>Negative emissions must be increased (humus, leguminous crops, agroforestry).</p><p>Nutrient cycles must be closed and synergies used.</p><p>Climate justice demands better growth opportunities for African agriculture - and that means the international community needs to allow fertiliser budgets for them and reduce mineral fertilisers in the other parts of the world.</p><p>Appropriate technical, institutional and social innovations to sustainably improve efficiency in agriculture.</p><p>Crop cultivation and land use</p><p>Let's start with nitrogen. It is, after water, the most important driver of plant growth, which is why ever more mineral fertiliser is being used. The problem is that both its production and application generate considerable emissions. The use of nitrogen fertiliser could be cut in half if:</p><p>its application were targeted,</p><p>good manure management were practised and</p><p>leguminous crops, which capture nitrogen from the atmosphere, figured more prominently in crop rotation.</p><p>Leguminous crops are so-called 'protein plants', including peas, beans, soybeans, peanuts and clover, as well as many other varieties of shrub, tree and algae. They are an important part of the solution. These plants carry bacteria inside their root nodules (rhizobia), which allow them to fix atmospheric nitrogen. They cover their own nitrogen requirements, with positive consequences for successive cultures or mixed cultures. If this natural mechanism were employed more extensively, significant quantities of nitrogen could be generated. That means negative emissions. There are synergies in regard to soil quality and nutrition moreover. Protein plants are part of a healthy diet, and the inclusion of these cultivars in crop rotation reduces the incidence of plant diseases and pests. Proper soil management can improve natural soil fertility and stimulate humus formation. It is important to grow legumes and use vegetable biomass as mulch.</p><p>Depressingly, the use of mineral fertiliser is increasing around the world. Africa is the big exception. Per hectare, only a tiny fraction of the global average is applied in this continent. The main reasons are high prices and low accessibility. Most African countries import mineral fertiliser and hardly produce any themselves. For this reason, and because of high transportation costs, fertiliser is much more expensive in Africa than elsewhere. Generally speaking, African smallholders cannot afford mineral fertiliser - at least not beyond the tiny, state-subsidised amounts.</p><p>At this point in time, however, it is still difficult to imagine the increase in productivity that Africa urgently needs happening without further application of mineral fertiliser. African agriculture needs access to affordable mineral fertiliser if it is to boost its productivity. Application elsewhere must be reduced accordingly if the generation of additional greenhouse-gas emissions is to be avoided.</p><p>In other words, the use of mineral fertiliser must be rationed on a global level. The redistribution in Africa's favour is essential - not least because its population is growing fast. Agricultural productivity must keep up. To strike the balance, the global north and many emerging markets must reduce their dependence on mineral fertiliser. Nitrogen pricing would serve that purposes by making fertiliser more expensive. Such a policy could help drive a shift to more leguminous crop cultivation, mulching and the application of organic fertiliser with animal excrements (including manure). Another relevant resource would be pretreated wastewater from municipal utilities. It contains nitrogen and phosphates. The point is that humanity needs approaches that cut across many sectors in order to close nutrient cycles and to use synergies.</p><p>More fruits and nuts</p><p>According to Pablo Tittonell, a professor of agro-ecology, people today are producing 40?% more grains than are actually needed to feed humanity in a safe and healthy way. It is certainly important to store grain reserves in case of emergencies, but 40?% of the total annual need is obviously too much. Therefore, the share of cereal cultivation could be scaled back in favour of other, more diverse crops.</p><p>Tittonell also says that humanity could get along with half of its current cattle population without suffering nutritional harm. Indeed, diets would actually become healthier. Make no mistake: this proposal does not apply to African smallholders who often depend on their few animals in order to operate. What is at stake is the industrial-scale feedlots in the EU, Latin America and elsewhere. They generate an excess of emissions and facilitate the overconsumption that harms the health of masses of consumers.</p><p>In order to feed people a healthier diet, Tittonell argues that more fruits and nuts would be more beneficial than expanding industrial beef production. A change in land use in this direction would also mean that the trees and shrubs that nuts and fruit grow on would capture carbon emissions. Essentially, this solution is very simple. A large share of the current grazing land for cattle must be planted with trees and shrubs. That would drastically reduce methane emissions and sequester CO2.</p><p>Such a transformation will take time. Above all, it will require prudent policymaking and effective awareness raising. Policy tools and incentives must be designed in such a way that this transformation will pave its own way. By contrast, prohibition and appeals to personal renunciation tend to backfire.</p><p>Wet rice cultivation is a very important area of food production. Because of its methane emissions, it is also relevant to the climate. One possibility of reducing emissions is more efficient cultivation that incorporates azolla (an aquatic fern and leguminous crop) and fish production in flooded rice fields. In addition, emissions can be reduced through rice or root intensification, with higher yields being achieved with fewer seeds. The methane output per kilogramme of rice can thereby be reduced. At the moment, scientists are working hard on researching varieties with lower methane outputs.</p><p>The soil as a carbon sink</p><p>Soil management is a core aspect of making agriculture climate-neutral. In addition to decreasing reliance on mineral fertiliser, slurry must no longer be applied without straw. Instead, it should be applied as manure. That would reduce emissions as well as run-off. The goal is to create fertile, humus-rich arable land that is rich in organic matter and the associated soil life. Such soil is also a carbon sink. An important policy instrument to achieve this goal is site-specific livestock farming. The acceptable number of animals must be linked to the size of the landholding, so the land can be fertilised without problem. Such policy interventions will make meat more expensive.</p><p>Organically saturated soil should also not be ploughed, because ploughing can release trapped carbon. Furthermore, soil should always be protected from wind and weather so that it does not dry out and is not eroded. Conservation agriculture (CA) fulfils all of these conditions. CA is already widespread in the US and Latin America, although it is carried out there in combination with the herbicide glyphosate. Weeds are the major challenge of the CA approach, since in no-till farming they can no longer be ploughed under. Nonetheless, the use of glyphosate is not necessary as practices in Africa show. The disadvantage of CA is that it is more labour- and knowledge-intensive than using the plough. This problem could be solved, however, with the help of technical innovations and education.</p><p>Closing nutrient cycles</p><p>Emission-free agriculture requires the use of treated municipal wastewater and other cross-sector approaches that impact non-agrarian practices. Using it to promote plant growth closes nutrient cycles.</p><p>Comprehensive approaches will often have societal dimensions. For example, in the Sahel region, herders could cooperate with crop farmers. Crop farmers could use animal manure and herders could graze their animals on crop residues. Such win-win constellations were once established by traditions, but those traditions have been abandoned. They should be reintroduced.</p><p>All of these climate-protection measures create positive synergies (for other locally adapted opportunities see article on climate-smart agriculture by Michaela Schaller in D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2017/11, Tribune).</p><p>Together with an effective policy framework and a willingness in society to embark on something new, this kind of transformation is feasible worldwide. Achieving it would mean climate neutrality or even additional negative emissions in the agricultural sector. At the same time, it would facilitate the production of adequate amounts of healthy food.</p><p>What is missing is the political will</p><p>Political will and public awareness are the most important drivers of climate-neutral agriculture. The preconditions for bringing about a shift in the private sector are effective incentives, well-designed taxes and the redistribution of subsidies, for instance from land subsidies for agriculture to payments for environmental services. The private sector has to be part of the transformation. It must innovate, and those innovations must be geared toward sustainability.</p><p>The global north, which is largely responsible for bringing about climate change so far, must pay for the lion's share of agrarian reform. The more it creates opportunities for people living in rural areas of the global south, the more beneficial it will be. Life in the countryside would once again offer prospects for the future - and that effectively addresses the causes of migration.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Indeed, inputs can and must be reduced. The following goals and principles should guide the sustainable reorientation of agriculture:It is possible and necessary to provide everyone with an adequate supply of healthy food. Nutrient cycles must be closed and synergies used.

In this connection, Lenzing donated a total of USD 27,000 to the Canopy project for its ongoing tree planting program. With this amount, Lenzing completes Earth Day Network's ambitious target of raising USD 150,000 for Earth Day 2017 (earthday.org/trees). The United Nations estimate that for every dollar spent on reforestation, USD 2.50 is generated in local downstream income and benefits.  'We're very grateful for Lenzing Group's generous donation', said Earth Day Network president Kathleen Rogers. 'With the help of partners such as Lenzing, we're not just planting trees, we're also helping build sustainable communities in areas of the world most in need of reforestation.'  The new sustainability strategy ,,Naturally Positive' of the Lenzing Group is the result of the new Group strategy sCore TEN adopted in the autumn of 2015. 'The concept of sustainability is an integral feature of our Group strategy. This is because Lenzing is in the unique position to be able to operate a truly circular business model. We produce functional, aesthetic and emotional products by utilizing the raw material wood from CO2 and sunlight', says Stefan Doboczky, Chief Executive Officer of the Lenzing Group. 'At the end of their useful lives, our fibers are biodegradable and thus once again serve as the basis for new plant growth.'   This model of the circular economy pervades the entire Lenzing sustainability strategy. It is based on the three 'P' cornerstones, People - Planet - Profit. Crucial operational components being implemented include the sustainable procurement of wood and a responsible handling of water. The raw material wood is completely converted into valuable industrial raw materials and bioenergy at the biorefineries of the Lenzing Group. Largely closed chemical cycles ensure the environmentally compatible production of LenzingTM fibers. Accordingly, more than 99 percent of the solvent used to manufacture TENCEL\\xAE fibers is recovered.  Other key aspects of the sustainability strategy applied by Lenzing are the decarbonization of production for the sake of improved climate protection as well as the promotion of sustainable innovations designed to replace resource- intensive, environmentally harmful products. Maintaining the required innovative strength is also a crucial element of the Group strategy sCore TEN.  This approach is complemented by a close cooperation with the value chain in order to jointly develop and implement systemic solutions. 'That is why we closely work together with multi-stakeholder initiatives and actively support a range of NGOs devoted to propagating sustainability principles', states Robert van de Kerkhof, Chief Commercial Officer of the Lenzing Group. 'With this in mind, we are pursuing a policy oriented towards the long term which features transparency and mutual trust with all our stakeholders.'   Effective immediately, the 'net benefit principle' comprises the new parameter Lenzing has introduced as an internal benchmark. It enables an objective assessment of products. The principle measures whether the product contributes added value to the environment and society as well as to Lenzing's partners. In this regard, the additional benefit considered over the product's entire life cycle must be considerably higher than other alternatives available on the marketplace. Examples of 'net benefit' products manufactured by Lenzing are TENCEL\\xAE fibers, Modal COLOR\\xAE fibers or the new Refibra(TM) fibers made from recycled cotton scraps.   The new sustainability strategy is described in detail in the newly published Sustainability Report 2016, which is available now for downloading on the Lenzing Website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lenzing.com/sustainability-reports\">http://www.lenzing.com/sustainability-reports</url>).  Canopy Project Through the Canopy Project, Earth Day Network works on the ground with organizations worldwide that strengthen communities through tree planting. Using sapling and seed distribution, urban forestry, agroforestry, and tree care training, we have empowered rural and urban people alike to conserve, repair, and restore tree cover to their lands. This project has led to millions of trees being planted on six different continents. Considering the United Nations estimates that for every dollar spent on reforestation, USD 2.50 is generated in local downstream income and benefits.  Since 2016, The Canopy Project has taken on even broader significance. Now the important work of planting trees and improving lives around the world also supports Earth Day Network's Trees for the Earth campaign. Trees for the Earth was the first of five new, ambitious, and goal-oriented campaigns to be launched in the run up to Earth Day's 50th anniversary in 2020. Its goal: to plant 7.8 bn trees worldwide by 2020 - one for every person projected to be on earth.

The  company  paid  523,000EUR in taxes,<br/>incurred  97.9 MEUR in purchases  and subcontracting, and  paid 19.5 MEUR in payroll<br/>for 195 direct jobs(2 ), 97.9% of which were in the local area.<br/>At  the same time, EMI  supported local health and  education initiatives to the<br/>tune  of 33,000EUR. This  support has  enabled 60 people  with reduced mobility to<br/>access  necessary  medical  care,  and  three  students  to  benefit from school<br/>scholarships.<br/>In France, Eramet's economic contribution amounted to more than 273 MEUR in 2024.<br/>The  Group paid 5.2 MEUR  in taxes, 138.6 MEUR  in purchases and subcontracting, and<br/>128.4 MEUR in payroll for a total workforce of 781.<br/>As part of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Eramet also launched the<br/>Eramet  Olympic  Challenge,  a  solidarity  challenge that mobilized nearly 400<br/>employees.  This  initiative  raised  10,000EUR for  the  \"Sport  dans  la  ville\"<br/>association, which supports young people in difficulty.<br/>In New Caledonia, Eramet was able to maintain an economic contribution of 369.6<br/>MEUR,  in  a  complex  political  and  social context. These contributions include<br/>221.2 MEUR in local purchases, 135.6 MEUR in payroll for 2,676 direct (jobs2 )(91.9%<br/>local)  and 12.6 MEUR in taxes paid.

Wir sind der Meinung, dass der Weg in die Zukunft darin besteht, mit mehr Partnern zusammenzuarbeiten, um eine groessere Wirkung zu erzielen. Gemeinsam mit unseren BIPOSC-Partnern hoffen wir, die Faehigkeiten und Kenntnisse von Kleinbauern durch regenerative Landwirtschaft und verwandte Techniken zu verbessern. Regenerative Landwirtschaft und Agroforstwirtschaft haben das Potenzial, Kleinbauern dabei zu helfen, Teil einer nachhaltigen Palmoel-Lieferkette zu werden. Es koennte ihnen helfen, alternative Einkommensquellen zu erschliessen, insbesondere waehrend der Wiederbepflanzungsperiode, in der ihre Palmoelpflanzen in der Regel drei Jahre lang unproduktiv sind\", sagte Rob Nicholls, General Manager, Projects &amp; Programs, Musim Mas Group.</p><p>Angesichts des Klimawandels und der bedrohten Artenvielfalt kann die regenerative Landwirtschaft fuer kleine landwirtschaftliche Betriebe eine Rolle spielen, da sie die Gesundheit des Bodens erhaelt, Erosion und Wasserabfluss verhindert und potenziell Treibhausgasemissionen und Stickstoffverluste verringern kann.</p><p>\"Als globale Entwicklungspartnerorganisation will die SNV Indonesia bei der Erreichung der Ziele fuer nachhaltige Entwicklung (SDGs) unterstuetzen. Um dies zu erreichen, muessen wir wirksame und wirkungsvolle Programme zur Umgestaltung der Landwirtschafts- und Lebensmittelsysteme, der Energie- und Wasserversorgung umsetzen. Im Rahmen des BIPOSC-Programms foerdern wir ein umfassendes regeneratives Landwirtschafts- und Agroforstmodell, um die Bodenfruchtbarkeit und die biologische Vielfalt zu erhalten und den Landwirten maximalen Nutzen fuer ihren Lebensunterhalt und die Wirtschaft zu bieten\", sagte Rizki Pandu Permana, Landesdirektor von SNV Indonesia.</p><p>Zu den wichtigsten Techniken der regenerativen Landwirtschaft, die gelehrt werden, gehoeren der Einsatz von Bioprodukten, das Mulchen zum Schutz des Mutterbodens, der Anbau von Bodendeckern, die integrierte Schaedlingsbekaempfung, die den Bedarf an chemischen Pestiziden verringert, und die Ausbringung von Kompost, der den Bedarf an chemischen Duengemitteln reduziert. Bisher wurden 1.032 unabhaengige Kleinbauern geschult, die diese Techniken in ihren Betrieben anwenden, was einer Gesamtflaeche von 1.063,68 Hektar entspricht. Im Rahmen des Projekts wurden 25 Dorfmoderatoren ausgebildet, die den Kleinbauern praktische Hilfe leisten, und sieben Demoparzellen als Pilotgebiete und Lernorte fuer regenerative Landwirtschaft eingerichtet.</p><p>\"Als ich vor einigen Jahren Palmoel-Kleinbauern in der Region besuchte, war ihre groesste Sorge der Zugang zu mehr Duengemitteln. Waehrend Duengemittel eine Schluesselrolle bei der Steigerung von Ertraegen spielen, klaffte eine deutliche Luecke im Verstaendnis, wie man den Boden vor langfristiger Degradation schuetzen kann. Die Kleinbauern brauchten mehr Wissen ueber die Erhaltung der Bodengesundheit, die Erhaltung der Bodenstruktur und andere wichtige Faktoren. Genau das war das Ziel des BIPOSC-Projekts, und wir freuen uns, dass die beteiligten Landwirte jetzt nicht nur hoehere Ertraege, sondern auch gesuendere Boeden auf ihren Parzellen verzeichnen\", sagte Bernard Giraud, Praesident und Mitbegruender von Livelihoods.</p><p>Das Projekt befasst sich auch mit dem Aufbau von Kapazitaeten. Zusaetzlich zur Hauskompostierung ermoeglichte das Projekt dem oertlichen Bauernverband APSKS LB, eine Kompostieranlage mit einer Kapazitaet von 100-150 Tonnen/Monat zu entwickeln und zu betreiben. Die Einheit produziert Kompost in grossem Massstab mit Inputs von nahe gelegenen Muehlen und landwirtschaftlichen Parzellen und bietet den Mitgliedsbauern Kompost zur Haelfte der ueblichen Marktpreise an. Im Jahr 2023, dem ersten Betriebsjahr, produzierte die Anlage 588 Tonnen Kompost und erwirtschaftete einen Gewinn von 421 Millionen IDR. Die Projektpartner sind der Meinung, dass dieses Modell auch andernorts nachgeahmt werden kann.</p><p>\"Eines der wirkungsvollsten Ergebnisse dieses Projekts fuer Kleinbauern ist die Kompostieranlage und das damit verbundene Geschaeftsmodell. Sie ermoeglicht es Kleinbauern, sich zu erschwinglichen Preisen mit Kompost zu versorgen, und die Gewinne werden unter den Mitgliedsbauern aufgeteilt. Dies ist eine praktische Loesung, um die Einfuehrung der Kompostierung zu foerdern, und alle ASPKS-LB-Kleinbauern verwenden jetzt Kompost auf ihren Anbauflaechen\", sagte Syahrianto, Vorsitzender der Labuanbatu Independent Oil Palm Smallholders Association.</p><p>Bis zum Jahr 2023 bewirtschaften unabhaengige Kleinbauern rund 41 % der Oelpalmenanbauflaechen in Indonesien, was 6,94 Millionen Hektar entspricht. Es wird erwartet, dass diese Zahl bis 2030 auf 60 % ansteigt, weshalb Projekte wie BIPOSC fuer die Gestaltung der Zukunft der nachhaltigen Palmoelproduktion entscheidend sind.</p><p>Devane Sharma</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:media@musimmas.com\">media@musimmas.com</email></p><p>Foto - <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533466/DSCF9193.jpg\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533466/DSCF9193.jpg</url></p><p>Foto - <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533468/DSC07760.jpg\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533468/DSC07760.jpg</url></p><p>Foto - <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533467/DSCF0748.jpg\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533467/DSCF0748.jpg</url></p><p>View original content: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ermoglichung-ein\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ermoglichung-ein</url> er-regenerativen-landwirtschaft-fur-unabhangige-kleinbauern-in-indonesien-das-bi posc-projekt-in-zusammenarbeit-mit-musim-mas-l3f-snv-indonesia-und-icraf-3022811 61.html</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">Weiteres Material: <url normalizedValue=\"http://presseportal.de/pm/172907/5890763\">http://presseportal.de/pm/172907/5890763</url><br/> OTS:               Musim Mas Holdings<br/></pre></p>", "publisher": "OTS Deutschland", "instances": ["Das Projekt begann im Jahr 2021 und verfolgt einen langfristigen Ansatz, um eine abholzungsfreie Lieferkette aufrechtzuerhalten, degradiertes Land zu regenerieren, die lokale Artenvielfalt wiederherzustellen und die Lebensgrundlage unabhaengiger Kleinbauern in Labuhanbatu, Nordsumatra, zu verbessern.

Gemeinsam mit unseren BIPOSC-Partnern hoffen wir, die F\u00e4higkeiten und Kenntnisse von Kleinbauern durch regenerative Landwirtschaft und verwandte Techniken zu verbessern. Regenerative Landwirtschaft und Agroforstwirtschaft haben das Potenzial, Kleinbauern dabei zu helfen, Teil einer nachhaltigen Palm\u00f6l-Lieferkette zu werden. Es k\u00f6nnte ihnen helfen, alternative Einkommensquellen zu erschlie\u00dfen, insbesondere w\u00e4hrend der Wiederbepflanzungsperiode, in der ihre Palm\u00f6lpflanzen in der Regel drei Jahre lang unproduktiv sind\", sagte Rob Nicholls, General Manager, Projects &amp; Programs, Musim Mas Group. <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533468/DSC07760.jpg\"/> Angesichts des Klimawandels und der bedrohten Artenvielfalt kann die regenerative Landwirtschaft f\u00fcr kleine landwirtschaftliche Betriebe eine Rolle spielen, da sie die Gesundheit des Bodens erh\u00e4lt, Erosion und\u00a0Wasserabfluss verhindert und potenziell Treibhausgasemissionen und Stickstoffverluste verringern kann.\u201eAls globale Entwicklungspartnerorganisation will die SNV Indonesia bei der Erreichung der Ziele f\u00fcr nachhaltige Entwicklung (SDGs) unterst\u00fctzen. Um dies zu erreichen, m\u00fcssen wir wirksame und wirkungsvolle Programme zur Umgestaltung der Landwirtschafts- und Lebensmittelsysteme, der Energie- und Wasserversorgung umsetzen. Im Rahmen des BIPOSC-Programms f\u00f6rdern wir ein umfassendes regeneratives Landwirtschafts- und Agroforstmodell, um die Bodenfruchtbarkeit und die biologische Vielfalt zu erhalten und den Landwirten maximalen Nutzen f\u00fcr ihren Lebensunterhalt und die Wirtschaft zu bieten\", sagte Rizki Pandu Permana, Landesdirektor von SNV Indonesia.Zu den wichtigsten Techniken der regenerativen Landwirtschaft, die gelehrt werden, geh\u00f6ren der Einsatz von Bioprodukten, das Mulchen zum Schutz des Mutterbodens, der Anbau von Bodendeckern, die integrierte Sch\u00e4dlingsbek\u00e4mpfung, die den Bedarf an chemischen Pestiziden verringert, und die Ausbringung von Kompost, der den Bedarf an chemischen D\u00fcngemitteln reduziert. Bisher wurden 1.032 unabh\u00e4ngige Kleinbauern geschult, die diese Techniken in ihren Betrieben anwenden, was einer Gesamtfl\u00e4che von 1.063,68 Hektar entspricht. Im Rahmen des Projekts wurden 25 Dorfmoderatoren ausgebildet, die den Kleinbauern praktische Hilfe leisten, und sieben Demoparzellen als Pilotgebiete und Lernorte f\u00fcr regenerative Landwirtschaft eingerichtet.\u201eAls ich vor einigen Jahren Palm\u00f6l-Kleinbauern in der Region besuchte, war ihre gr\u00f6\u00dfte Sorge der Zugang zu mehr D\u00fcngemitteln. W\u00e4hrend D\u00fcngemittel eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle bei der Steigerung von Ertr\u00e4gen spielen, klaffte eine deutliche L\u00fccke im Verst\u00e4ndnis, wie man den Boden vor langfristiger Degradation sch\u00fctzen kann. Die Kleinbauern brauchten mehr Wissen \u00fcber die Erhaltung der Bodengesundheit, die Erhaltung der Bodenstruktur und andere wichtige Faktoren. Genau das war das Ziel des BIPOSC-Projekts, und wir freuen uns, dass die beteiligten Landwirte jetzt nicht nur h\u00f6here Ertr\u00e4ge, sondern auch ges\u00fcndere B\u00f6den auf ihren Parzellen verzeichnen\", sagte Bernard Giraud, Pr\u00e4sident und Mitbegr\u00fcnder von Livelihoods.Das Projekt befasst sich auch mit dem Aufbau von Kapazit\u00e4ten. Zus\u00e4tzlich zur Hauskompostierung erm\u00f6glichte das Projekt dem \u00f6rtlichen Bauernverband APSKS LB, eine Kompostieranlage mit einer Kapazit\u00e4t von 100-150 Tonnen/Monat zu entwickeln und zu betreiben. Die Einheit produziert Kompost in gro\u00dfem Ma\u00dfstab mit Inputs von nahe gelegenen M\u00fchlen und landwirtschaftlichen Parzellen und bietet den Mitgliedsbauern Kompost zur H\u00e4lfte der \u00fcblichen Marktpreise an. Im Jahr 2023, dem ersten Betriebsjahr, produzierte die Anlage 588 Tonnen Kompost und erwirtschaftete einen Gewinn von 421 Millionen IDR. Die Projektpartner sind der Meinung, dass dieses Modell auch andernorts nachgeahmt werden kann. <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533467/DSCF0748.jpg\"/> \u201eEines der wirkungsvollsten Ergebnisse dieses Projekts f\u00fcr Kleinbauern ist die Kompostieranlage und das damit verbundene Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell.

Dies ist eine praktische L\u00f6sung, um die Einf\u00fchrung der Kompostierung zu f\u00f6rdern, und alle ASPKS-LB-Kleinbauern verwenden jetzt Kompost auf ihren Anbaufl\u00e4chen\", sagte Syahrianto, Vorsitzender der Labuanbatu Independent Oil Palm Smallholders Association.Bis zum Jahr 2023 bewirtschaften unabh\u00e4ngige Kleinbauern rund 41 % der \u00d6lpalmenanbaufl\u00e4chen in Indonesien, was 6,94 Millionen Hektar entspricht. Es wird erwartet, dass diese Zahl bis 2030 auf 60 % ansteigt, weshalb Projekte wie BIPOSC f\u00fcr die Gestaltung der Zukunft der nachhaltigen Palm\u00f6lproduktion entscheidend sind.Devane Sharma<br/>media@musimmas.com\u00a0Foto -https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533466/DSCF9193.jpg<br/>Foto -https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533468/DSC07760.jpg<br/>Foto -https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2533467/DSCF0748.jpg <url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=GE33599&amp;sd=2024-10-20\"/> View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ermoglichung-einer-regenerativen-landwirtschaft-fur-unabhangige-kleinbauern-in-indonesien-das-biposc-projekt-in-zusammenarbeit-mit-musim-mas-l3f-snv-indonesia-und-icraf-302281161.html <url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=GE33599&amp;Transmission_Id=202410200415PR_NEWS_EURO_ND__GE33599&amp;DateId=20241020\"/></p>", "publisher": "PR Newswire Europe(German)", "instances": ["PR NewswireJAKARTA, Indonesien, 20.

Der Agroforestry and Restoration Accelerator ist ein solches CO2-Abbauprojekt und Teil von Amazons Verpflichtung zur Erf\u00fcllung von The Climate Pledge, eine Initiative, die das Unternehmen gemeinsam mit Global Optimism ins Leben gerufen hat. Die Unterzeichner des Klimaversprechens verpflichten sich, bis 2040 - 10 Jahre vor dem \u00dcbereinkommen von Paris - eine CO2-neutrale Produktion zu erreichen. </p><p> Im Rahmen der Verpflichtung zur Erf\u00fcllung des Klimaversprechens setzt Amazon in erster Linie seine Innovationen fort und investiert in die Dekarbonisierung seiner Gesch\u00e4ftsbereiche. Das Unternehmen hat 100.000 elektrische Lieferfahrzeuge erworben und ist der gr\u00f6\u00dfte gewerbliche Abnehmer von erneuerbaren Energien in der Welt. Amazon investiert dar\u00fcber hinaus in naturbezogene L\u00f6sungen au\u00dferhalb seiner Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette durch den Right Now Climate Fund, der den Accelerator und andere Projekte zur Wiederbelebung gesch\u00e4digter B\u00f6den auf eine Art und Weise unterst\u00fctzt, die die Lebensgrundlage der lokalen Gemeinschaften verbessert und CO2 aus der Atmosph\u00e4re entfernt. Dar\u00fcber hinaus arbeiten Amazon und andere Partner im Rahmen der k\u00fcrzlich angek\u00fcndigten LEAF Coalition - einer \u00f6ffentlich-privaten Initiative, die mindestens 1 Milliarde USD f\u00fcr den Schutz der weltweiten Tropenw\u00e4lder mobilisieren soll - daran, die Abholzung der Tropenw\u00e4lder einzud\u00e4mmen und so den CO2-Aussto\u00df in die Atmosph\u00e4re zu verringern. </p><p> ,,Die Wiederherstellung der W\u00e4lder der Welt ist eine der sinnvollsten Ma\u00dfnahmen, die wir jetzt ergreifen k\u00f6nnen, um den Klimawandel zu bek\u00e4mpfen, und sie erfordert innovative L\u00f6sungen, um erfolgreich zu sein\", sagte Kara Hurst, Vice President des Bereichs Worldwide Sustainability bei Amazon. ,,Wir sind stolz darauf, den Agroforestry and Restoration Accelerator in Zusammenarbeit mit The Nature Conservancy ins Leben zu rufen, um L\u00f6sungen zu f\u00f6rdern, die eine hohe \u00f6kologische Integrit\u00e4t und einen starken Nutzen f\u00fcr die Gemeinschaft in den Vordergrund stellen. Amazon freut sich sehr darauf, unsere Leidenschaft f\u00fcr Innovation in Verbindung mit finanzieller Unterst\u00fctzung zur Verbesserung der Lebensgrundlagen lokaler Gemeinschaften in Brasilien einzubringen und gleichzeitig dazu beizutragen, den Planeten f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftige Generationen zu sch\u00fctzen.\" </p><p> ,,Die Wissenschaft ist eindeutig der Meinung, dass nat\u00fcrliche Systeme bei der Aufnahme von CO2 aus der Atmosph\u00e4re Priorit\u00e4t haben, und der j\u00fcngste IPCC-Bericht best\u00e4tigt dies\", sagte Christiana Figueres, Mitbegr\u00fcnderin von Global Optimism und ehemalige UN-Klimachefin, die f\u00fcr das \u00dcbereinkommen von Paris ma\u00dfgeblich verantwortlich ist. ,,Der Schutz bestehender \u00d6kosysteme und die Wiederherstellung gesch\u00e4digter Fl\u00e4chen sind als Strategien zur Verringerung des CO2-Aussto\u00dfes von entscheidender Bedeutung, insbesondere in den n\u00e4chsten ein bis zwei Jahrzehnten. Projekte, die dieses Ziel erreichen, um sowohl die Natur als auch die Lebensgrundlagen der lokalen Gemeinschaften zu erhalten, sind von unsch\u00e4tzbarem Wert f\u00fcr den Wandel, der notwendig ist, um weit \u00fcber die Klimakrise hinaus zu gedeihen. Ein gro\u00dfes Lob an Amazon und The Nature Conservancy.\" </p><p> Die Anfangsinvestition von Amazon in den Accelerator wird 3.000 Landwirte f\u00f6rdern und innerhalb von drei Jahren etwa 20.000 Hektar wiederherstellen - eine Landmasse, die in etwa der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Stadt Seattle entspricht - und bis 2050 bis zu 10 Millionen Tonnen Kohlendioxid aus der Atmosph\u00e4re entfernen. </p><p> The Nature Conservancy wird mit dem World Agroforestry Centre und mehreren lokalen zivilen Organisationen zusammenarbeiten, um den Accelerator umzusetzen. Dabei werden Kleinbauern bei der Umwandlung gesch\u00e4digter Viehweiden in einheimischen Wald und Agroforstwirtschaft unterst\u00fctzt. Die Agroforstsysteme werden den Landwirten \u00fcber den Verkauf von Kakao und anderen Nutzpflanzen eine nachhaltige Einkommensquelle bieten. Im Rahmen des Accelerators werden dar\u00fcber hinaus innovative Wege zur Unterst\u00fctzung der Landwirte und zur F\u00f6rderung der M\u00e4rkte f\u00fcr nachhaltige forstwirtschaftliche Erzeugnisse getestet, auch mit Hilfe digitaler Technologien, und es werden neue Methoden und satellitengest\u00fctzte Technologien zur Quantifizierung und \u00dcberwachung des CO2-Abbaus entwickelt. </p><p> ,,Par\u00e1 ist Heimat von 9 Prozent des weltweiten Tropenwaldes. Doch diese Region sieht sich mit einer beispiellosen Abholzung konfrontiert und hat im letzten Jahr jeden Tag 3.300 Hektar Wald verloren\", sagte Jennifer Morris, CEO von The Nature Conservancy. ,,In den letzten 13 Jahren waren kleine Farmen in Par\u00e1 - einem Gebiet, in dem Brandrodung die einzige Option zu sein scheint - f\u00fcr durchschnittlich 40 % der Entwaldung im Bundesstaat verantwortlich. Seit 20 Jahren arbeitet The Nature Conservancy mit Kleinbauern, Gemeindevertretern, Regierungsbeamten und indigenen V\u00f6lkern zusammen, um L\u00f6sungen zu finden und umzusetzen, die f\u00fcr beide Seiten von Vorteil sind, wie z. B. die Agroforstwirtschaft, die den Menschen und der Natur zu Wohlstand verhilft. Diese neue Partnerschaft mitAmazon erm\u00f6glicht es uns, die Ressourcen und die technische Unterst\u00fctzung bereitzustellen, die n\u00f6tig sind, um dieses Programm voranzubringen und zu zeigen, dass regenerative Agroforstwirtschaft und CO2-M\u00e4rkte tragf\u00e4hige Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle f\u00fcr die Gemeinden im Amazonasgebiet sind.\" </p><p> ,,Wir m\u00fcssen unsere Kr\u00e4fte vereinen, um das Jahrhundertziel zu erreichen: unsere Wirtschaft weiterzuentwickeln und das Einkommen der Menschen zu sichern und gleichzeitig den Wald zu erhalten und wiederherzustellen\", sagte Helder Barbalho, Gouverneur von Par\u00e1. ,,Der Bundesstaat Par\u00e1 ist bereit, sich dieser Herausforderung zu stellen, und unsere Strategie ist in unserem <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amazonia Agora</emphasis>-Plan klar festgelegt. Darin verpflichten wir uns, bis 2036 durch die Reduzierung der Abholzung und die F\u00f6rderung der Wiederaufforstung kohlendioxidfrei zu werden.

Die gleiche Zahl peilen gro\u00dfe Umweltverb\u00e4nde wie der WWF mit der Kampagne \"Trillion Trees\" an.

B\u00e4ume haben schlie\u00dflich viele Vorteile: \"Sie binden Kohlendioxid, speichern Wasser, bieten Lebensraum und Nahrung, spenden Schatten und verhindern Bodenerosion\", sagt die Umweltwissenschaftlerin Karen Holl von der University of California in Santa Cruz. Doch die \"Besessenheit\", B\u00e4ume zu pflanzen, k\u00f6nne auch negative Auswirkungen haben, etwa wenn die falschen B\u00e4ume am falschen Ort gepflanzt werden.</p><p>So wie im Baringo County, einem Verwaltungsbezirk im Westen von Kenia. In den 80er Jahren wurde hier die \"Prosopis Juliflora\" aus S\u00fcdamerika importiert. Der Baum, der schnell w\u00e4chst und auf trockenem Boden gut zurecht kommt, sollte den Prozess der W\u00fcstenbildung stoppen. Anfangs funktionierte das auch. Doch dann entwickelte sich der Import zu einer \"wirklich traurigen Geschichte\", sagt Mieke Bourne vom World Agroforestry Centre in Nairobi.</p><p>Denn nach einigen Jahren breitete der stark invasive Baum sich immer weiter aus. Weidefl\u00e4chen wurden \u00fcberwuchert, einheimische Pflanzen verdr\u00e4ngt, die am Baum wachsenden Schoten verursachten bei den Ziegen Zahnausfall. Inzwischen gibt es Bem\u00fchungen, die Ausbreitung des Baumes wieder einzud\u00e4mmen.</p><p>Auch andere afrikanische L\u00e4nder setzen auf \"exotische\" Pflanzen, etwa den schnell wachsenden Eukalyptus-Baum. Die Wissenschaftlerin Bourne empfiehlt, bei Aufforstungen st\u00e4rker auf heimische Arten zu setzen. Sie hat au\u00dferdem die Erfahrung gemacht, dass die lokale Bev\u00f6lkerung eingebunden sein sollte, damit ein Projekt erfolgreich wird. \u00c4hnlich sieht es ihre Forscherkollegin Holl. Die Menschen m\u00fcssten den Anbau eines Baumes als \"Wert\" ansehen, sagt sie. F\u00fcr einen Landwirt kann der darin bestehen, dass er Brennholz erh\u00e4lt, Fr\u00fcchte wie Mangos ernten kann, Schatten f\u00fcr sein Vieh hat oder bei manchen Projekten auch eine finanzielle Verg\u00fctung bekommt.</p><p>Bei gescheiterten Aufforstungsvorhaben fehlte oft die langfristige Perspektive. Es gebe Kampagnen, die einen Baum f\u00fcr einen Euro oder einen Dollar versprechen. Das klinge \"verlockend\", sagt Holl. Doch auch wenn das vielleicht der Preis f\u00fcr das Einpflanzen eines Setzlings sei, decke das nicht die Kosten daf\u00fcr, dass der Baum \u00fcberlebt und mit der Zeit w\u00e4chst. \"Wichtig ist nicht das Pflanzen, sondern das Gro\u00dfziehen\", sagt sie.</p><p>B\u00e4umepflanzen sei au\u00dferdem dann problematisch, wenn es als \"einfaches Wundermittel\" angepriesen werde. \"Um das Klima zu sch\u00fctzen, ist es nur ein kleines Puzzleteil\", sagt sie.

Named Burj Zanzibar - \"burj\" meaning tower in Arabic - the<br/>spectacular high-rise is designed to reach 96 metres in height. Dubbed<br/>\"vertical green village\", it would represent an iconic landmark not only for<br/>the island but for the whole of Africa and a global environmental milestone,<br/>being the first timber structure worldwide of such proportions. The design<br/>of the mixed-use apartment and commercial building, in a playful beehive<br/>style with breathtaking ocean views, was unveiled to the public in Muscat,<br/>Oman on 1 October. Dutch-born architect Leander Moons, responsible for the<br/>concept, said: \"Burj Zanzibar is not just an outstanding building but a new<br/>ecosystem for the future of living\".</p><p>The residential tower with 266 residences is to be located in Fumba Town,<br/>East Africa's pioneering eco-town developed by German-led engineering firm<br/>CPS. Categorised as a strategic investment and fully supported by the<br/>Zanzibar government, the growing city near the capital, where foreigners are<br/>allowed to buy, stretches along a 1.5-kilometre seashore on the southwest<br/>coast. \"Burj Zanzibar will be the highlight and natural continuation of our<br/>efforts to provide sustainable housing in Africa, thereby empowering local<br/>employment and businesses\", elaborated CPS CEO Sebastian Dietzold in Muscat.</p><p>With turquoise seas, white sandy beaches and a UNESCO-protected historic<br/>Stone Town, Zanzibar recorded 15% annual growth in tourism in recent years<br/>and 6.8% economic growth. Earlier this year, the semi-autonomous<br/>archipelago, 35 kilometres off the coast of Tanzania, stretched its wings<br/>also into another direction, launching an initiative to attract African tech<br/>companies with a total worth of six billion dollars.</p><p>Benefits of timber</p><p>Timber is the oldest building material in the world. As timber technology,<br/>it currently enjoys a renaissance because of its environmental benefits and<br/>longevity. New timber products such as cross-laminated timber (CLT) and<br/>glulam are considered the building material of the future. One cubic metre<br/>of wood binds half a ton of carbon dioxide, whereas conventional concrete<br/>construction is responsible for 25% of CO2 emissions.</p><p>Once realised, Burj Zanzibar would be the highest timber building in the<br/>world and Africa's first high-rise ever in this innovative technology. A few<br/>weeks ago the 86.6-metre Ascent Tower in Milwaukee, US, was certified as the<br/>world's tallest timber hybrid building by the Council on Tall Buildings and<br/>Urban Habitat (CTBUH). Africa's highest conventional skyscraper is a<br/>385-metre office tower named \"Iconic Tower\" in Egypt, still under<br/>construction.</p><p>Tanzania's top skyscraper is the 157-metre Ports Authority building in Dar<br/>es Salaam. The world's tallest conventional building is Burj Khalifa in<br/>Dubai with 828 metres.</p><p>Consortium of specialists from New York to Switzerland</p><p>Burj Zanzibar is planned as a hybrid timber tower. A steel-reinforced<br/>concrete core is designed to meet all required fire and life safety<br/>standards. The project is to be executed by a consortium of leading<br/>specialists from Switzerland, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Tanzania and<br/>the US. Green roof gardens and planted balconies further reduce the carbon<br/>footprint of the building. \"Burj Zanzibar will be a widely visible new<br/>landmark for Zanzibar and beyond, not only because of its appearance but<br/>because of its construction method\", said architect Leander Moons during the<br/>launch event.</p><p>Set to promote locally available wood as a building material, Tanzania and<br/>its vast land resources for agroforestry would also benefit from the<br/>ambitious green mega tower. A large forest development in central Tanzania<br/>near Iringa already covers twice the size of New York; \"an enlarged forest<br/>industry could create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the East African<br/>country\", said CPS Director Dietzold.</p><p>Playful, elegant style fitting any culture</p><p>The playful architectural style - reminiscent of a beehive with honeycombs -<br/>combines modern urban trends with local culture. \"Panorama windows,<br/>closed-in green loggias and a modular layout will enhance the green nature<br/>of the tower and allow for flexible apartment floor plans, tailor-made for<br/>any cultural preferences\", explained lead architect Moons.

The focus is on<br/>sustainability and the empowerment of local businesses. CPS currently<br/>implements two large building projects in Zanzibar, with further African<br/>projects in planning. Fumba Town is the fastest growing urban development in<br/>Tanzania with permaculture landscaping, 94% waste-recycling, health care,<br/>educational facilities and a total volume of $400 million to eventually<br/>house 20,000 people. The Soul is Zanzibar's first-ever residential leisure<br/>resort along the East Coast of the tropical tourism island with hundreds of<br/>holiday apartments.

Gemeinsam mit Treedom setzt sich Nico Rosberg fuer nachhaltige und regional effektive Baumpflanzungsprojekte ein. Diese sorgen in vom Klimawandel besonders betroffenen Regionen nicht nur fuer Begruenung und Bindung von CO2 und Wasser, sondern schaffen fuer Menschen in diesen Gegenden auch einen oekonomischen Mehrwert. Gepflanzt werden ueberwiegend Obst-, Kakao- und Kaffeebaeume, die nachhaltig gezogen und gepflegt werden und Bauern vor Ort ein Einkommen und eine Lebensgrundlage gewaehren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Die Partnerschaft umfasst zudem ein Investment Nico Rosbergs am Unternehmen Treedom. Rosberg engagiert sich zusammen mit weiteren Investoren (u.a.

Diese Social-Business-Idee kombiniert mit der absoluten Transparenz, die ich sowohl als virtuell Baumpflanzender auf meinem Treedom Baumprofil erhalte, aber auch das Unternehmen, das im grossen Stil weltweit Projekte foerdert, ueberzeugt mich. Gemeinsam wollen wir nun einen weiteren Impact schaffen, der Mensch und Umwelt hilft\", so Nico Rosberg.</p><p>Federico Garcea ergaenzt: \"Als vor einigen Monaten Nico Rosberg und sein Team mit uns Kontakt aufgenommen haben, war bei uns die Freude gross. Natuerlich kennen wir ihn als Sportidol, aber vor allem beeindruckt uns sein Bewusstsein fuer Nachhaltigkeit und seine klugen Entscheidungen bei Investments, bei denen er Unternehmertum und seine weltweite Reichweite perfekt fuer die gute Sachen vereint: Aufmerksamkeit fuer und Wachstum von Projekten rund um das, was Menschen brauchen, um in ihrer Heimat gut leben zu koennen, ein Auskommen zu haben, und fuer eine Umwelt, die nicht weiter zerstoert wird. Als wir uns in Berlin getroffen haben, um uns die Hand auf die Partnerschaft zu geben, habe ich zu Nico gesagt: 'Stell dir vor, welchen Impact wir erreichen koennten, wenn jeder Europaeer oder jedes Unternehmen auch nur einmal im Jahr ein physisches Geschenk mit einem Baum ersetzt.' Das ist unsere gemeinsame Vision, mit vielen kleinen Taten Grosses zu schaffen.\"</p><p>Redaktionelle Hinweise</p><p>Ueber Nico Rosberg:</p><p>Nico Rosberg wurde 1985 in Wiesbaden als Sohn des Formel-1-Weltmeisters Keke Rosberg geboren.

Rosberg ist in zahlreiche erfolgreiche Startups wie Lilium, Volocopter, What3Words und Tier investiert. Er ist ausserdem Investor und Anteilseigner der elektrischen Rennserie Formel E. 2021 tritt Rosberg mit einem eigenen Rennteam in der Extreme E an, eine Rennserie, die sich dem Kampf gegen den Klimawandel verschrieben hat. 2019 gruendete er das GREENTECH FESTIVAL, eine globale Plattform fuer fuehrende gruene Technologien und einen nachhaltigen Lebensstil, das weltweit grosse Aufmerksamkeit geniesst.

Das Besondere daran: Der Kakao fuer diese Eigenmarken-Tafelschokolade stammt aus einem wegweisenden Projekt mit der Kooperative \"Fanteakwa\" in Ghana, die Lieferkette ist vollstaendig rueckverfolgbar. Die Kakaobauernfamilien erhalten neben den jeweiligen Fairtrade-Praemien und -Mindestpreisen einen monetaeren Aufschlag in Form des sogenannten Fairtrade Living Income Differentials. Mit der Zahlung dieses Aufschlags wird der Fairtrade Living Income Referenzpreis fuer Ghana erreicht. Dieser von Fairtrade berechnete Preiszuschlag entspricht in der aktuellen Erntesaison rund 15 Prozent pro Tonne Kakao und ist ein wesentlicher Baustein zur Erreichung von existenzsichernden Einkommen fuer Kakaobauernfamilien.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Die \"Very Fair\"-Eigenmarkenschokolade ist Fairtrade-zertifiziert und traegt das REWE Group Nachhaltigkeitslabel PRO PLANET.

Die Zahlung eines hoeheren Kakaopreises allein reicht oft nicht aus, um fuer die Bauernfamilien ein existenzsicherndes Einkommen zu gewaehrleisten. Darum hat die REWE Group als erster Lebensmittelhaendler in Deutschland bereits 2019 in Kooperation mit dem Bundesministerium fuer wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ) und Fairtrade ein Projekt fuer existenzsichernde Einkommen im Kakaosektor gestartet. Ziel des Gemeinschaftsprojektes ist es, die wirtschaftliche Unabhaengigkeit der Bauern und Baeuerinnen in der Kooperative \"Fanteakwa\" innerhalb weniger Jahre massgeblich zu verbessern und ihnen zu ermoeglichen, aus den Einnahmen ihrer Landwirtschaft ein existenzsicherndes Einkommen zu erzielen.</p><p>Das Gemeinschaftsprojekt setzt bewusst ganzheitlich an: Neben der Zahlung des Fairtrade Living Income Differentials umfasst es auch Schulungen, die von der Initiative fuer nachhaltige Agrarlieferketten (INA) und ihren lokalen Partnern umgesetzt werden. Schwerpunkte sind nachhaltigere Anbaupraktiken, eine effizientere Bewirtschaftung der Farmen sowie die Verbesserung des Managements der Kooperativen. Ausserdem werden weitere Kulturen wie beispielsweise Cashew-Baeume gefoerdert, um alternative Einkommensquellen fuer die Bauern und Baeuerinnen zu erschliessen. In diesem Zusammenhang ist die REWE Group der Competitive Cashew Initiative (ComCashew) beigetreten, die zum Ziel hat, die Wettbewerbsfaehigkeit der Cashew-Wertschoepfungskette in ausgewaehlten afrikanischen Laendern zu erhoehen.</p><p>Als Gruendungsmitglied des \"Forum Nachhaltiger Kakao\" engagiert sich die REWE Group bereits seit vielen Jahren fuer den zertifizierten Anbau von Kakao und unterstuetzt Kakaobauern und -baeuerinnen in den Anbauregionen, unter anderem im Rahmen des Projekts PRO PLANTEURS. Mit ihrer Leitlinie fuer Kakaoerzeugnisse hat die REWE Group Anforderungen fuer Verbesserungen der Bedingungen beim Kakaoanbau und Ziele fuer die Umstellung auf nachhaltig zertifizierte Quellen definiert. Saemtliche Schokoladenartikel sowie Instantkakao, Nuss-Nougat-Brotaufstriche und Suessgebaeck der Eigenmarken bei REWE und PENNY in Deutschland sind mittlerweile bereits auf Fairtrade bzw. das Fairtrade-Kakaoprogramm umgestellt.

Reiche Industriestaaten machen ebenso mit wie \u00e4rmere L\u00e4nder. Nach Angaben der britischen Regierung stehen hinter der Erkl\u00e4rung Staaten, die gemeinsam mehr als 85 Prozent der W\u00e4lder auf der gesamten Erde beherbergen.</p><p>Wie viele W\u00e4lder sind schon abgeholzt?</p><p>Von urspr\u00fcnglich sechs Milliarden Hektar Wald auf der Erde sind laut WWF schon zwei Milliarden weg. \"Jedes Jahr gehen im Durchschnitt rund zehn Millionen Hektar verloren\", sagt Susanne Winter, Programmleiterin Wald bei der Umweltorganisation. \"Das entspricht der gesamten Waldfl\u00e4che in Deutschland.\"</p><p>Auch die Plattform \"Global Forest Watch\" vom World Resources Institute ver\u00f6ffentlicht regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Zahlen, wie sich Waldbest\u00e4nde ver\u00e4ndern. Dazu werden Satellitenbilder und nationale Statistiken ausgewertet sowie lokale Forschung herangezogen. Im Jahr 2020 ging demnach eine Tropenwaldfl\u00e4che in der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von 12,2 Millionen Hektar verloren. Das entspricht einem Plus von zw\u00f6lf Prozent gegen\u00fcber dem Vorjahr. Die mit Abstand gr\u00f6\u00dften Fl\u00e4chenverluste gab es in Brasilien, gefolgt vom Kongo, Bolivien, Indonesien, Peru und Kolumbien. Schaut man sich auch die anderen W\u00e4lder an, waren es im vergangenen Jahr sogar mehr als 25 Millionen Hektar.</p><p>Problematisch sei, dass vor allem \"alte, kohlenstoffreiche W\u00e4lder mit hoher Biodiversit\u00e4t\" verloren gingen, sagt Wald-Expertin Winter. Etwa 15 bis 20 Prozent der globalen Emissionen gingen in jedem Jahr auf Entwaldung zur\u00fcck. \"Wenn alte W\u00e4lder verschwinden, wird Kohlendioxid freigesetzt.\"</p><p>Warum geht so viel Wald verloren?</p><p>Ein gro\u00dfer Teil des globalen Waldverlusts geht darauf zur\u00fcck, dass Fl\u00e4chen stattdessen f\u00fcr die Landwirtschaft genutzt werden: etwa zum Anbau von Palm\u00f6l und Soja, das wiederum in gr\u00f6\u00dferem Ma\u00dfstab als Tierfutter eingesetzt wird. Immer wieder kommt es dabei zu illegalem Holzschlag oder zu Brandrodungen. Auf ehemaligen Regenwaldfl\u00e4chen werden aber auch Holzplantagen angelegt, auf denen unter anderem Zellstoff produziert wird. Die WWF-Expertin Winter sieht darin ein Problem: \"Nach dem Kahlschlag wachsen dort W\u00e4lder nach, die nicht mehr so wertvoll sind.\"</p><p>Was bringt die Initiative der Staatschefs?</p><p>Auch wenn Gro\u00dfbritanniens Premierminister Johnson von einem \"bahnbrechenden\" Abkommen spricht, ist die Skepsis in den Umweltverb\u00e4nden gro\u00df. Aus Sicht von WWF-Expertin Susanne Winter ist es zwar \"ein gutes Zeichen\", dass es eine solche Initiative gebe. \"Es fehlt allerdings die Verbindlichkeit\", sagt sie. Schon im Jahr 2014 sei beim Klimagipfel in New York beschlossen worden, die Entwaldung bis 2020 zu halbieren. \"Das ist nicht gelungen.\" Auch die Greenpeace-Klimaexpertin Lisa G\u00f6ldner kritisiert die Freiwilligkeit. Sie habe \"erhebliche Zweifel\", dass Brasilien sich an die Verabredungen halten werde. Sie findet die Initiative auch aus einem anderen Grund entt\u00e4uschend. \"Wir m\u00fcssen Abholzung sofort zur\u00fcckfahren\", sagt sie. Viele L\u00e4nder k\u00f6nnten die Verabredung als \"Freifahrtschein\" verstehen, bis 2030 noch so viele der verbleibenden Urw\u00e4lder wie m\u00f6glich abzuholzen.</p><p>Was k\u00f6nnte die Politik noch tun?</p><p>Auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene wird aktuell ein Gesetz gegen Entwaldung diskutiert. Es soll regeln, dass Importe in die EU und innerhalb der EU nicht mit Entwaldung oder Zerst\u00f6rung anderer \u00d6kosysteme verbunden sein darf. Voraussichtlich Mitte November will die EU-Kommission einen Entwurf vorstellen. \"Die n\u00e4chste Bundesregierung sollte sich daf\u00fcr einsetzen, dass dieses Gesetz tats\u00e4chlich zum Erhalt von W\u00e4ldern beitr\u00e4gt\", fordert WWF-Fachfrau Winter. So seien beispielsweise \"wirksame Kontrollen und Strafverfolgung\" bei illegalen Importen von Agrar- und Holzrohstoffen und deren Produkten notwendig.</p><p>Damit Regenwald erhalten bleibt, gibt es au\u00dferdem die Forderung nach klaren Regeln. So verlangten Vertreter indigener V\u00f6lker im September beim Kongress der Weltnaturschutzunion (ICUN), 80 Prozent des Amazonas-Regenwaldes bis zum Jahr 2025 unter Schutz zu stellen.</p><p>Kann Aufforstung Abhilfe leisten?</p><p>Regierungen und Organisationen auf der ganzen Welt \u00fcberbieten sich mit dem Versprechen, die Erde wieder aufzuforsten. Manche L\u00e4nder machen daraus sogar einen Wettbewerb. \u00c4thiopien nimmt f\u00fcr sich in Anspruch, einen neuen Rekord aufgestellt zu haben: Im Juli 2019 sollen in zw\u00f6lf Stunden mehr als 350 Millionen Setzlinge gepflanzt worden sein.</p><p>Die Initiative \"1t.org\" verk\u00fcndete im vergangenen Jahr beim Weltwirtschaftsforum in Davos, eine Billionen B\u00e4ume bis 2030 pflanzen zu wollen. Die gleiche Zahl peilen Umweltverb\u00e4nde wie der WWF mit der Kampagne \"Trillion Trees\" an. Deutschland wiederum unterst\u00fctzt die \"Bonn Challenge\", die in diesem Jahrzehnt entwaldete Fl\u00e4chen in der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von Indien renaturieren m\u00f6chte, insgesamt 350 Millionen Hektar Land. Auch viele Unternehmen werben mittlerweile damit, dass sie sich f\u00fcr Baumpflanzprojekte engagieren.</p><p>Unbestritten ist, dass B\u00e4ume viele Vorteile haben. \"Sie binden Kohlendioxid, speichern Wasser, bieten Lebensraum und Nahrung, spenden Schatten und verhindern Bodenerosion\", sagt die Umweltwissenschaftlerin Karen Holl von der University of California in Santa Cruz. Die Forscherin h\u00e4lt es aber f\u00fcr problematisch, wenn das B\u00e4umepflanzen als \"einfaches Wundermittel\" angepriesen werde. Viele ambitionierte Initiativen seien meistens gut gemeint. Doch immer wieder gibt es auch Projekte, die scheitern. \"B\u00e4umepflanzen ist keine einfache L\u00f6sung\", sagt Holl. \"Es muss sorgf\u00e4ltig geplant werden.\" Die \"Besessenheit\", B\u00e4ume zu pflanzen, k\u00f6nne auch negative Auswirkungen haben, etwa wenn die falschen B\u00e4ume am falschen Ort gepflanzt werden.</p><p>Wie kann Aufforstung gelingen?</p><p>Damit Aufforstungsprojekte erfolgreich sind, m\u00fcssen ein paar Regeln beachtet werden - das haben zahlreiche Untersuchungen ergeben. Dazu geh\u00f6rt eine sorgf\u00e4ltige Wahl der B\u00e4ume f\u00fcr einen konkreten Standort. So wurde in den 80er Jahren im Baringo County, einem Verwaltungsbezirk im Westen von Kenia, die \"Prosopis Juliflora\" aus S\u00fcdamerika importiert. Der Baum, der schnell w\u00e4chst und auf trockenem Boden gut zurechtkommt, sollte den Prozess der W\u00fcstenbildung stoppen.</p><p>Anfangs funktionierte das auch. Doch dann entwickelte sich der Import zu einer \"wirklich traurigen Geschichte\", sagt Mieke Bourne vom World Agroforestry Centre in Nairobi. Denn nach einigen Jahren breitete der stark invasive Baum sich immer weiter aus. Weidefl\u00e4chen wurden \u00fcberwuchert, einheimische Pflanzen verdr\u00e4ngt. Die am Baum wachsenden Schoten verursachten bei den Ziegen Zahnausfall. Inzwischen gibt es Bem\u00fchungen, die Ausbreitung des Baumes wieder einzud\u00e4mmen. Die Wissenschaftlerin Bourne empfiehlt deshalb, st\u00e4rker auf heimische Arten zu setzen.</p><p>Die Wald\u00f6kologin Robin Chazdon hat die Erfahrung gemacht, dass es oft nicht n\u00f6tig ist, neue B\u00e4ume zu pflanzen. Chazdon ist auch f\u00fcr die UN als Beraterin zur Wiederherstellung von W\u00e4ldern und Landschaften t\u00e4tig. Gerade in Trockenlandschaften habe sich die sogenannte \"Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration\" bew\u00e4hrt. Dabei setzt man auf den nat\u00fcrlichen \u00dcberlebensmechanismus der B\u00e4ume, die vorher gef\u00e4llt wurden. \"Die Wurzeln sind immer noch da und schlummern unter der Erde.\" Wenn in solchen Gebieten die Erde nicht gepfl\u00fcgt werde, dann w\u00fcrden auch die Wurzeln nicht zerst\u00f6rt. Aus diesen k\u00f6nnen Sch\u00f6sslinge entstehen, die bei entsprechender Pflege zu kr\u00e4ftigen B\u00e4umen heranwachsen.</p><p>Wichtig sei, die lokale Bev\u00f6lkerung einzubinden. Die Menschen m\u00fcssten den Anbau eines Baumes als \"Wert\" ansehen, sagt Forscherin Holl. Wenn man B\u00e4ume auf dem Land von jemandem pflanze und derjenige keinen Nutzen daraus ziehe, werde er diese B\u00e4ume wahrscheinlich nicht weiter gro\u00dfziehen.</p><p>Was bringen B\u00e4ume gegen die Klimakrise?</p><p>Im Kampf gegen die Klimakrise werden W\u00e4lder oft als Teil der L\u00f6sung beschrieben. Wenn B\u00e4ume wachsen, nehmen sie durch Photosynthese Kohlendioxid aus der Luft auf und speichern dieses im Stamm, den \u00c4sten, Wurzeln und im Humus. W\u00e4lder werden deshalb von Regierungen beim Klimaschutz als \"nat\u00fcrliche Senken\" mitgerechnet, die Kohlenstoff speichern k\u00f6nnen.</p><p>Eike L\u00fcdeling, Professor am Institut f\u00fcr Nutzpflanzenwissenschaften und Ressourcenschutz der Uni Bonn, sagt, Aufforstung d\u00fcrfe nicht als Alternative zu CO2-Einsparungen gesehen werden. \"W\u00e4lder k\u00f6nnen allenfalls ein Zehntel der Emissionen auffangen.\" Auch die Umweltwissenschaftlerin Holl warnt davor, den Effekt von Aufforstungen zu \u00fcbersch\u00e4tzen. \"Um das Klima zu sch\u00fctzen, ist das B\u00e4umepflanzen nur ein kleines Puzzleteil.\" Viel wichtiger sei, das Abholzen und die Zerst\u00f6rung von bestehenden W\u00e4ldern zu stoppen und den Aussto\u00df von Treibhausgasen drastisch zu reduzieren.</p>", "publisher": "Der Tagesspiegel", "instances": ["Der Baum, der schnell w\u00e4chst und auf trockenem Boden gut zurechtkommt, sollte den Prozess der W\u00fcstenbildung stoppen.

Maintaining the required innovative<br/>strength is also a crucial element of the Group strategy sCore TEN.</p><p>This approach is complemented by a close cooperation with the value chain in<br/>order to jointly develop and implement systemic solutions. \"That is why we<br/>closely work together with multi-stakeholder initiatives and actively support a<br/>range of NGOs devoted to propagating sustainability principles\", states Robert<br/>van de Kerkhof, Chief Commercial Officer of the Lenzing Group. \"With this in<br/>mind, we are pursuing a policy oriented towards the long term which features<br/>transparency and mutual trust with all our stakeholders.\" </p><p>Effective immediately, the \"net benefit principle\" comprises the new parameter<br/>Lenzing has introduced as an internal benchmark. It enables an objective<br/>assessment of products. The principle measures whether the product contributes<br/>added value to the environment and society as well as to Lenzing's partners. In<br/>this regard, the additional benefit considered over the product's entire life<br/>cycle must be considerably higher than other alternatives available on the<br/>marketplace.

Entsprechend wird im \u00fcber 200 Seiten dicken Bericht \"The State of Food and Agriculture\" beklagt, dass die Entwicklungshilfe f\u00fcr die Agrarwirtschaft w\u00e4hrend der neunziger Jahre abnahm und die Industriel\u00e4nder zugleich an ihrem massiven Landwirtschaftsprotektionismus festhielten.</p><p>Neben diesen bereits im Juni am \"Hungergipfel\" in Rom diskutierten Problemen versucht die FAO in ihrem neusten Jahresbericht aber auch die Aufmerksamkeit darauf zu richten, dass die Landwirtschaft, die Fischerei sowie die Forstwirtschaft nicht bloss der Versorgung mit Nahrungsmitteln und als Verdienstquelle f\u00fcr die im Prim\u00e4rsektor aktiven Personen dienen. Wie FAO-Generaldirektor Jacques Diouf im Vorwort betont, k\u00f6nnen Land- und Forstwirte sowie Fischer auch eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Landschaftspflege oder beim Schutz der Artenvielfalt und der Stabilit\u00e4t der \u00d6kosysteme spielen. Bei diesen Aufgaben handle es sich jedoch um \"\u00f6ffentliche G\u00fcter\", die der Allgemeinheit dienten und entsprechend abzugelten w\u00e4ren. Zugleich macht man bei der FAO geltend, dass es effektiv auch keine zuverl\u00e4ssige Evidenz daf\u00fcr gebe, dass sich Armutsbek\u00e4mpfung und Umweltverbesserungen praktisch von selbst gegenseitig befl\u00fcgelten.</p><p>In einem Sonderkapitel des Jahresberichts wird dargelegt, dass die Landwirtschaft nicht zuletzt auch einen grossen Beitrag zur Eind\u00e4mmung der Treibhausgasemissionen leisten k\u00f6nnte und deshalb im Rahmen des im Kyoto-Protokoll vorgesehenen \"Clean Development Mechanism\" finanzielle Anreize erhalten sollte.

Mehr als 240 Millionen Menschen leben in den tropischen Waeldern, aus den Pflanzen, Tieren und Baeumen gewinnen sie ihre Medizin, ihre Nahrung, ihr Einkommen. Den Tropenwald zu schuetzen bedeutet, auch diesen Menschen zu helfen, ihre weitere Verarmung zu verhindern.\"</p><p> David Kaimowitz, Generaldirektor des internationalen Waldforschungszentrums CIFOR, beschrieb mit diesen Worten gestern zum Auftakt einer internationalen Forstwirtschaftskonferenz in Bonn den schwierigen Spagat, den die Wissenschaftler leisten muessen: den Wald zu erhalten, und gleichzeitig die Lebensbedingungen und Einkommen der Menschen in den Tropenwaldregionen zu verbessern. Fuenf Tage lang beraten rund 200 Experten aus mehr als 40 Laendern in Bonn ueber das Thema. Eingeladen haben neben CIFOR das Bundesministerium fuer wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ), die Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Weiterbildung (Inwent), die Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) und das World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF)</p><p> Eines der Ziele ist, dem Tropenwaldschutz wieder zu einem herausragenden Platz auf der internationalen Agenda zu verhelfen. Die oeffentliche Aufmerksamkeit habe sich nicht erst in Zeiten von Afghanistan-Konflikt und Irak-Krieg anderen Themen zugewandt, klagen die Organisatoren. Dabei, so Weltbank-Vizepraesident Ian Johnson gestern, sei \"der Erhalt des Tropenwaldes eine der grossen Herausforderungen dieses Jahrhunderts\"</p><p> \"Die Waelder sind aelter als die Menschheit\", erklaerte Inwent-General-Direktor Ulrich Popp. \"Dort lag unsere Vergangenheit, unser Genpotenzial, dort entscheidet sich unsere Zukunft.\" Und dennoch gehen jaehrlich immer noch mehr als zwoelf Millionen Hektar Tropenwald verloren, das entspricht etwa einem Drittel der Flaeche Deutschlands.</p><p> Die Ursachen sind vielfaeltig: Illegaler Holzeinschlag gehoert ebenso dazu wie gezielte Rodungen, um Land zu kultivieren oder als Weideland zu nutzen. Neue Steuergesetze, verfehlte Subventionen oder Umsiedlungspolitik koennen die Entwaldung ebenso anheizen wie Strassenbau oder Korruption. Solche Zusammenhaenge bis hin zu der Frage, wie weltweite Handelspolitik oder Wechselkurse die Zerstoerung der Waelder beeinflussen, muessten kuenftig staerker beruecksichtigt werden, betonte Johnson. Zu wenig beachtet wird seiner Ansicht nach auch der indirekte Nutzen, den die Waelder hervorbringen, etwa ihre Bedeutung fuer den Schutz des Klimas oder der Wassereinzugsgebiete. \"Manchmal ist dieser Nutzen viel groesser als der Wert des Holzes, das sich verkaufen liesse.\"</p><p> Die Ergebnisse der Bonner Konferenz sollen in das 4. UN-Waldforum im kommenden Jahr einfliessen. Hoffnungen auf schnelle Fortschritte beim Tropenwaldschutz will Kaimowitz allerdings nicht machen. \"In den meisten Regionen mit tropischen Waeldern gibt es schwache Regierungen, viele Menschen und viele konfliktreiche Interessen. Wenn wir einfach einen Zaun um diese Waelder ziehen koennten und Waechter aufstellen, waere die Sache einfach. Aber dort leben 240 Millionen Menschen; es geht um Wirtschaftsaktivitaeten mit einem Volumen von Milliarden Dollar, und 40 Prozent der tropischen Waelder befinden sich in Laendern, in denen in den letzten zehn bis 15 Jahren Buergerkriege tobten.

Fuenf Tage lang beraten rund 200 Experten aus mehr als 40 Laendern in Bonn ueber das Thema. Die oeffentliche Aufmerksamkeit habe sich nicht erst in Zeiten von Afghanistan-Konflikt und Irak-Krieg anderen Themen zugewandt, klagen die Organisatoren.

Doch waehrend Wasserknappheit, Luftverschmutzung und Abholzung der Regenwaelder als globale Bedrohung im oeffentlichen Bewusstsein praesent sind, fristet die Bodenproblematik immer noch ein Schattendasein. Anfang Mai diskutierten Fachleute an der Jahrestagung des Schweizerischen Zentrums fuer internationale Landwirtschaft (ZIL) an der ETH Zuerich darueber, wie die Bodenfruchtbarkeit erhalten werden kann.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Gemaess Schaetzungen wird sich der Nahrungsmittelbedarf in den naechsten 25 Jahren weltweit verdoppeln. Das heisst, die landwirtschaftlichen Flaechen muessen in Zukunft noch intensiver genutzt werden. Vor allem die Boeden der Tropen sind dabei extremen Belastungen ausgesetzt. Verkuerzte Brachezeiten und nicht standortgerechte Anbausysteme laugen den von Natur aus naehrstoffarmen tropischen Boden rasch aus. Die Bauern koennen die mit der Ernte entzogenen Naehrstoffe meistens gar nicht oder nur unvollstaendig ersetzen, da Duengemittel in vielen Entwicklungslaendern sehr teuer und oft gar nicht verfuegbar sind. Dadurch nimmt die Bodenfruchtbarkeit rasch ab, und die Ertraege sinken. Ein Teufelskreis aus Armut und Bodenzerstoerung entsteht, den es zu durchbrechen gilt. Wie Daba Fall, technische Beraterin des senegalesischen Landwirtschaftsministers, an der diesjaehrigen Jahrestagung des Schweizerischen Zentrums fuer internationale Landwirtschaft an der ETH Zuerich erklaerte, sind Landnutzungssysteme gesucht, die eine nachhaltige Bodennutzung ermoeglichen und zu einem Gleichgewicht zwischen Oekonomie und Oekologie verhelfen.</p><p>Duenger und Feuerholz zugleich</p><p> Das ZIL wurde 1993 an der ETH Zuerich mit dem Bestreben gegruendet, Forschungspartnerschaften mit Entwicklungslaendern zu foerdern und die interdisziplinaere Forschung zur Entwicklung einer nachhaltigen Nutzung natuerlicher Ressourcen zu koordinieren. Mit Unterstuetzung der Direktion fuer Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit (Deza) bearbeitet das ZIL gegenwaertig sieben neue Forschungsprojekte. Diese Projekte wurden an der Jahrestagung erstmals vorgestellt. Forscherinnen und Forscher der Gruppe Pflanzenernaehrung vom Institut fuer Pflanzenwissenschaften untersuchen beispielsweise zusammen mit dem \"International Centre for Research in Agroforestry\" (ICRAF) in Nairobi den Einfluss von Leguminosenbrachen auf die Phosphor- und Stickstoffumsetzung in tropischen Boeden.</p><p> Das ICRAF hat in den letzten Jahren fuer die dichtbesiedelten Regionen im westlichen Kenya verschiedene Anbausysteme entwickelt, die auch den Kleinbauern Ertragssteigerungen bringen. Dazu wird von zwei Maisanbauphasen pro Jahr eine durch eine strauchartige Leguminosenbrache ersetzt. Den Bauern stehen verschiedene schnellwachsende Leguminosenarten wie zum Beispiel Crotalaria grahamiana und Tephrosia vogelii zur Verfuegung. Diese Pflanzen koennen mit Hilfe von Wurzelknoellchen-Bakterien Stickstoff aus der Luft fixieren und produzieren nebenbei auch noch Feuerholz. Die so in sechs bis acht Monaten gewachsene Biomasse ist wesentlich groesser und naehrstoffreicher als die Rueckstaende der Maispflanze. Noch ein Jahr nach Einarbeitung der Rueckstaende liess sich eine Erhoehung verschiedener bodenbiologischer Parameter nachweisen.</p><p> Im ZIL-Projekt geht es nun darum, die Prozesse, die hinter den Ertragssteigerungen stehen, zu verstehen. Nur so kann man naemlich sicher sein, dass es sich wirklich um ein nachhaltiges System handelt. Waehrend es beim Stickstoff zu einem Eintrag ins System kommt, diskutieren die Fachleute fuer Phosphor verschiedene Moeglichkeiten: Schwer loesliche Phosphorformen im Boden koennten ueber die Leguminosenrueckstaende in eine fuer Pflanzen besser verfuegbare Form gebracht werden. Zudem duerften hoehere Umsatzraten - bedingt durch die groessere biologische Aktivitaet im Boden - eine Rolle spielen.</p><p> Auch wenn die Versuche mit den strauchartigen Leguminosenbrachen vielversprechend sind, gehen die ZIL-Leute mit Roel Merckx vom Labor fuer Bodenfruchtbarkeit und Bodenbiologie an der katholischen Universitaet von Leuven in Belgien einig: Langfristig wird eine Integration von organischer und anorganischer Duengung (vor allem beim Phosphor) der einzig gangbare Weg fuer eine nachhaltige Bodennutzung sein. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, ist die Agrarforschung auch auf politische und soziooekonomische Veraenderungen in den Entwicklungslaendern angewiesen.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Leguminosen fuer Extremstandorte</p><p> Ein weiteres ZIL-Projekt, das von der Gruppe Graslandwissenschaften am Institut fuer Pflanzenwissenschaften der ETH Zuerich bearbeitet wird, erforscht die Mechanismen, die fuer die Hemmung der symbiotischen Stickstoff-Fixierung in Leguminosen auf phosphorarmen Boeden verantwortlich sind. Phosphor scheint fuer die symbiotische Stickstoff-Fixierung in Leguminosen von zentraler Bedeutung zu sein. Herrscht Phosphormangel im Boden, wird die Symbiose gehemmt, und die wichtigste natuerliche Stickstoffquelle des Bodens versiegt. Dies ist gerade in den Tropen, wo aus oekonomischen und logistischen Gruenden die Duengerversorgung weitgehend unzureichend ist, eine Katastrophe. In diesen Laendern bildet die symbiotische Stickstoff-Fixierung eine wichtige Grundlage zur Erhaltung der Bodenfruchtbarkeit.</p><p> Als Modellarten dienen den Forscherinnen und Forschern vorerst die Leguminose Lotus japonicus (japanischer Schotenklee) und deren Partner fuer die Symbiose, das Wurzelknoellchen-Bakterium Mesorhizobium loti. Der japanische Schotenklee eignet sich deshalb sehr gut, weil sein Genom bereits gut charakterisiert ist. Um lokalisieren zu koennen, wo und in welchem Entwicklungsstadium die Knoellchenbildung gehemmt wird, werden die Pflanzen bei verschiedenen Phosphorkonzentrationen kultiviert. Mit Hilfe von histochemischen Methoden versucht man herauszufinden, welche fuer die Knoellchenentwicklung entscheidenden Proteine unter Phosphormangel von der Pflanze noch produziert werden. Sobald die Mechanismen fuer die Hemmung der symbiotischen Stickstoff-Fixierung beim japanischen Schotenklee bekannt sind, sollen die Versuche auf tropische Leguminosen ausgedehnt werden. Das Ziel dieser Studie ist es, mitzuhelfen, das Angebot an tropischen Leguminosen, welche auch in phosphorarmen Boeden gut Stickstoff fixieren koennen, zu erhoehen. Solche Pflanzenarten sind fuer eine nachhaltige Landnutzung von Vorteil.</p><p> Die Autorin hat Biologie studiert und arbeitet als Wissenschaftsjournalistin in Zuerich.</p>", "publisher": "Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (Internationale Ausgabe) & NZZ am Sonntag", "instances": ["Mit Unterstuetzung der Direktion fuer Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit (Deza) bearbeitet das ZIL gegenwaertig sieben neue Forschungsprojekte.
