Ten million people <url normalizedValue=\"https://tb.impactcounter.com/\">could</url> acquire tuberculosis, leading to two million deaths. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Seville, governments cannot simply paper over the cracks of a collapsing developing finance system. </p><p>In 2015, at the time of the last U.N. Financing for Development Conference, some rich countries had reached the global target they had set for themselves of contributing 0.7% of their Gross National Income to global development. But a decade has passed, and governments are now turning away from that ambition to focus on defense spending. In 2024, not a single G-7 country approached that goal, and 2025 will be the year of the largest decline ever in aid to developing countries. </p><p>With NATO states being the largest aid donors, their recent agreement of NATO to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 will only make matters <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/25/nato-defense-spending-gpp-charts/\">worse</url>. Aid is not a panacea, but it has made an enormous difference. It has enabled investment in critical priorities like the HIV response. A new generation of international cooperation, emphasizing not just humanitarian assistance, requires a <url normalizedValue=\"https://globalpublicinvestment.org/\">Global Public Investment</url> approach for global public goods - of which global public health is among the most important. </p><p>Meanwhile, developing countries are suffocating under $3 trillion in debt, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldbank.org%2Fen%2Fprograms%2Fdebt-toolkit%2Fdsa&amp;data=05%7C02%7CKarpsaweyJ%40unaids.org%7C4930cb09bb0e4c41383608dda9acfcbb%7Cc2e1cf9be1b644eb8021428c292d3eb5%7C0%7C0%7C638853282668067685%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ju1PJNCcEM0AYedAFWclF9pkUMooIFCR5jrgUMrfwI4%3D&amp;reserved=0\">more than half</url> of low-income countries either in debt distress or at high risk of it. The result is that today, net, money is flowing from developing countries to the advanced countries - just the opposite of what should be happening. Over half of Global South debt is held by private banks and firms, but they are typically slow in participating in debt relief, and when they do, often offer far less than is needed. Their importance, even amongst the poorest countries, makes debt restructuring more complex and slower. It took Zambia four years to reach an agreement for debt relief. Even for Ukraine, amidst war, it took four months. </p><p>Over the last few years, money has actually been going from developing countries to private creditors in the advanced countries. What enables the perverse flow of money is that the international financial institutions, the IMF and the multilateral development banks, are engineering a de facto bailout for private creditors with the money they are providing to the developing world. What makes this especially disturbing is that in spite of this and repeated earlier bailouts, private creditors receive high interest rates, well in excess of what is needed to compensate them for the risk they bear. </p><p>Austerity is not an option. Already, countries are barely covering the basic needs of their citizens. Low- and middle-income countries are doing all they can to fund lifesaving programs, but they simply don't have the money needed to meet the burden. Today, 3.3 billion people live in countries that <url normalizedValue=\"https://unctad.org/publication/world-of-debt\">spend more</url> on servicing debt than on health or education. </p><p>That's why Pope Francis, in the last year of his life, launched the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pass.va/en/events/2025/tax_justice/press_release.html\">Jubilee Commission</url> - a panel of leading economists, legal scholars, and development experts tasked with understanding how the world ended up in this mess. They found that by forcing countries to cut investments in health, education, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-22/more-action-more-climate-ambition-a-call-from-the-global-south.html\">climate adaptation</url> to service unsustainable debts, our development financing system does not just fail to prevent crises, it makes them worse and more frequent. </p><p>However, every crisis creates an opportunity. Governments now have a chance to build a better, more sustainable global financial structure. What is needed is more than just resolving the current debt and development crisis, but reforming the architecture in ways to make sure another such crisis doesn't happen; to provide not just more financial assistance, but enhancing growth opportunities, by, for instance, fairer trade arrangements, ensuring that developing countries aren't exploited through illicit financial flows finding their way to advanced countries, through western corporations paying less than fair market value for the resources that they take from developing countries, through enabling poor countries to capture more of the tax revenues that are their due based on the activities that originate in their countries, by encouraging productive capital flows to developing countries rather than the exploitive flows into and out of these countries. Indeed, Africa alone is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.un.org/osaa/sites/www.un.org.osaa/files/tackling_iffs_in_tax_reform_and_illegal_commercial_practices_-_nov_2022.pdf\">losing</url> more than $88 billion every year to illicit financial flows, mostly tax abuse, as such money seeks, and finds, a safe-harbor in one advanced country or another. </p><p>At the turn of the millennium, as AIDS was killing millions in Africa, unfair and unsustainable debt burdens were <url normalizedValue=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-01-30/its-not-witchcraft-its-a-lack-of-development-aid-a-political-lurch-from-london-is-putting-the-eradication-of-diseases-in-africa-at-risk.html\">worsening the continent's sufferin</url>g. But governments, charities, and faith groups pushed for change through the Jubilee 2000 campaign. They secured more than $100 billion in debt relief, enabling governments to invest in health, education, and social protection. HIV infections fell by the millions over the following two decades, helping to put the world on track to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Innovations are available today that can change the HIV trajectory keeping millions safe through long acting injectables, yet intellectual property rights are standing on the way; our system of intellectual property requires structural reform, too - something that became all too evident during the pandemic, with so many unnecessary hospitalizations and deaths simply because IP related to COVID-19 was not shared. </p><p>In Seville this week, leaders have an incredible opportunity to make a renewed commitment to global justice and solidarity. It's even in the self-interest of everyone in the world: diseases don't need passports or visas. An unhealthy global population provides a fertile field for development of a pandemic that could spread quickly around the world. Global inequalities breed societal breakdowns and polarization that fuels the conflicts that also know no borders. </p><p>A new multilateralism is necessary. What happens in Seville can build on the momentum set by the 2023 agreement to move forward on the U.N. Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, an agreement that could help to ensure that the wealthiest individuals and corporations pay their fair share. And Seville should mark a point of departure for a new debt restructuring system that allows developing nations to have the fiscal space necessary to lead their own future. </p><p>What will be important at Seville is not just the official agreement that emerges, but the commitment, the momentum, provided by the Seville Platform for Action, motivating alliances to <url normalizedValue=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-06-27/the-public-sector-cant-do-it-alone-a-new-era-for-global-development.html\">work together in solidarity</url> for the wellbeing of the entire world. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joseph Stiglitz</emphasis> is a Nobel Laureate in economics and Professor at Columbia University. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Winnie Byanyima</emphasis> is the Executive Director of UNAIDS.

Descarbonizar no pasa \u00fanicamente por la electrificaci\u00f3n: hay m\u00e1s tecnolog\u00edas y soluciones que Espa\u00f1a y Europa no est\u00e1n considerando del todo , subray\u00f3 Antonio L\u00f3pez-Rodriguez, head de transici\u00f3n energ\u00e9tica y cambio clim\u00e1tico de Repsol. En concreto, hizo alusi\u00f3n a alternativas como el hidr\u00f3geno verde y el biometano, a\u00f1adiendo que  necesitamos marcos regulatorios estables que apoyen la inversi\u00f3n de las compa\u00f1\u00edas a largo plazo y permitan que los costes de la transici\u00f3n energ\u00e9tica se reduzcan .</p><p>El responsable de Repsol remarc\u00f3 que el control de las emisiones de Alcance 3  aquellas originadas en la cadena de suministro  es uno de los principales retos para las grandes empresas, una visi\u00f3n que comparti\u00f3 Beatriz Arribas, senior manager de sostenibilidad de Coca-Cola Europacific Partners:  En nuestro caso representa m\u00e1s del 90% de las emisiones; eso nos brinda una gran oportunidad porque tenemos la capacidad de ayudar a otros sectores acompa\u00f1ando a nuestros proveedores . Con el foco en \u00e1mbitos como la hosteler\u00eda,  las empresas l\u00edderes debemos tomar decisiones y asumir esa responsabilidad de liderazgo , dijo Arribas, que abog\u00f3 por  pasar del compromiso a la acci\u00f3n .</p><p>En este sentido,  cada empresa afronta el desaf\u00edo de la neutralidad en carbono desde una posici\u00f3n distinta; por ello es importante la flexibilidad y la colaboraci\u00f3n p\u00fablico- privada , coment\u00f3 Cristina Riestra, jefa del \u00e1rea de medioambiente y cambio clim\u00e1tico de la CEOE. Las pymes necesitan capacitaci\u00f3n y recursos para sumarse a estos objetivos, pero deben hacerlo para no perder competitividad, dado que accionistas e inversores cada vez se fijan m\u00e1s en los aspectos ligados a la sostenibilidad. De este modo, Riestra afirm\u00f3 que  la colaboraci\u00f3n entre empresas y sectores resulta esencial para la adaptaci\u00f3n al cambio clim\u00e1tico , as\u00ed como las inversiones en tecnolog\u00eda e infraestructuras sostenibles.</p><p>Pese a que Espa\u00f1a goza de una buena posici\u00f3n relativa en la senda de la descarbonizaci\u00f3n, queda mucho por hacer en el plano de la movilidad tanto de personas como de mercanc\u00edas.  Nos enfrentamos a un problema complejo donde las restricciones fundamentales no tienen que ver con la tecnolog\u00eda ni con la disponibilidad de recursos financieros, con la gobernanza, la toma de decisiones y la b\u00fasqueda de incentivos suficientes , destac\u00f3 Gonzalo Delac\u00e1mara, director del IE Centre for Water &amp; Climate Adaptation.

Uno de los puntos m\u00e1s destacados de la conversaci\u00f3n ha sido el concepto de soberan\u00eda ante las inminentes elecciones europeas. Almunia ha esgrimido que la democracia europea no es perfecta, y que un aspecto a mejorar ser\u00eda que comenzasen a existir aut\u00e9nticas familias pol\u00edticas europeas, \"en lugar de partidos nacionales que se presentan a las europeas\". Pese a todo, el exministro ha mantenido que Europa representa al \"referente mundial\" en cuanto al bienestar generado en el mundo, algo que no siempre se comparte en el concierto internacional. \"Han dejado de ver la democracia liberal europea como un referente indiscutible. Es nuestra responsabilidad volver a ganar adeptos y exportar nuestro modelo a pa\u00edses del Sur Global\".</p><p>Rajoy, por su parte, ha defendido que una de las razones para explicar la crisis de fe en las democracias liberales surgi\u00f3 a partir de la Gran Recesi\u00f3n. \"Las democracias liberales no han sabido dar respuesta a algunos problemas de la sociedad, y de ah\u00ed surgen los populismos que proclaman soluciones pero que luego no saben gobernar, ni resolver nada\". Y ante al auge de la extrema derecha y los posibles pactos de los partidos hegem\u00f3nicos para formar gobierno con los ultras, el expresidente conservador ha recordado que la UE nace de la uni\u00f3n de dos grandes fuerzas pol\u00edticas, los populares y los socialdem\u00f3cratas. \"Puede haber acompa\u00f1antes, pero si rompemos las reglas, no sabemos qu\u00e9 va a pasar\".</p><p>Una de las claves para ambos pol\u00edticos en la reserva es recuperar la soberan\u00eda para que Europa vuelva a volverse relevante en el \u00e1mbito internacional ante el auge de amenazas externas como China y Rusia. Rajoy y Almunia han coincidido al argumentar que Europa debe aspirar a algo m\u00e1s que a \"subarrendar\" la seguridad a los Estados Unidos, especialmente ante un posible regreso de Trump a la Casa Blanca que haga que los EE UU dejen de ser un socio fiable para los europeos. \"Hay que reforzar la alianza atl\u00e1ntica, pero con garant\u00edas para Europa.

Sin embargo, la situaci\u00f3n es todav\u00eda realmente mala en el \u00e1rea mediterr\u00e1nea. Buena parte padece c\u00edclicamente periodos de sequ\u00eda, que han hecho que el pa\u00eds se haya ido preparando para contar con reservas y fuentes alternativas. A pesar de esa preparaci\u00f3n, los an\u00e1lisis de los expertos que maneja el Gobierno para abordar la planificaci\u00f3n hidrol\u00f3gica apuntan a una situaci\u00f3n cada vez peor debido al cambio clim\u00e1tico.  Los pron\u00f3sticos, advierte el Ministerio para la Transici\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica en su planificaci\u00f3n, se\u00f1alan que habr\u00e1 una \u201creducci\u00f3n de la disponibilidad de agua\u201d en el futuro, adem\u00e1s de una \u201cmayor frecuencia e intensidad de fen\u00f3menos hidrometeorol\u00f3gicos extremos como las sequ\u00edas e inundaciones\u201d. Ante este pron\u00f3stico, \u00bfse pueden abrir v\u00edas alternativas para compensar ese descenso de recursos?</p><p> Para resolver esta pregunta lo mejor es comprender primero d\u00f3nde va a parar el agua en Espa\u00f1a y cu\u00e1nto se consume. En 2021, se emplearon 32.024 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos (hm\u00b3) en usos consuntivos: abastecimiento urbano, uso agrario e industrial. Y, a mucha distancia del resto, el primer consumidor es el sector agrario: ese a\u00f1o consumi\u00f3 el 80,4% de los recursos. Le siguen los usos urbanos (15,5%) y los industriales (3,4%). Al decretar recortes, siempre se sigue una jerarqu\u00eda: primero se reduce el agua para la agricultura, luego a la industria y en \u00faltimo lugar el consumo urbano. Los recortes ya han llegado a esa \u00faltima fase en Catalu\u00f1a y Andaluc\u00eda. \u00bfEs posible evitarlos? \u00bfSe pueden construir m\u00e1s embalses? \u00bfM\u00e1s trasvases? \u00bfDesalaci\u00f3n o aguas regeneradas? A lo primero a lo que el ministerio apunta abiertamente es a rebajar la demanda. Advierte en su planificaci\u00f3n de que \u201cla reducci\u00f3n en la disponibilidad de agua para los distintos usos aconseja plantearse disminuciones de la utilizaci\u00f3n del agua del orden del 15%\u201d de aqu\u00ed a 2050. O lo que es lo mismo: recortes de tres puntos porcentuales \u201cen cada ciclo sexenal de planificaci\u00f3n\u201d. Aunque no se descarta aumentar, por ejemplo, la capacidad de desalaci\u00f3n y reutilizaci\u00f3n.  \u201cEspa\u00f1a es el primer pa\u00eds de Europa en embalses y el quinto del mundo\u201d, explica Hugo Mor\u00e1n, secretario de Estado de Medio Ambiente. La capacidad total de embalsado en la Espa\u00f1a peninsular asciende a los 56.039 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos. Pero en estos momentos, la reserva alcanza los 31.844 hm\u00b3, casi el 57%. Esta cantidad servir\u00eda para cubrir casi un a\u00f1o entero de consumo en teor\u00eda. Pero eso solo es teor\u00eda, porque en la pr\u00e1ctica hay un desequilibrio evidente que hace que haya zonas que respiran tranquilas \u2014las cuencas del Duero y del Ebro superan el 70%\u2014 mientras que otras est\u00e1n en una situaci\u00f3n complicad\u00edsima, como las Cuencas Mediterr\u00e1neas Andaluzas, Guadalete, Segura e Internas de Catalu\u00f1a, que no llegan ni al 25% de la reserva. \u00bfLa soluci\u00f3n, entonces, son m\u00e1s pantanos? Mor\u00e1n no descarta que sea posible construir m\u00e1s embalses. Pero no cree que sea \u201caconsejable\u201d por \u201crazones de car\u00e1cter ambiental, social y econ\u00f3mico\u201d. Entre otras cosas, porque las normas europeas obligan a que se mantengan unos caudales m\u00ednimos en los r\u00edos para conservar la biodiversidad. Pero Mor\u00e1n insiste: \u201cEl problema que tenemos ahora no es de embalses, es de agua; el problema es que los embalses est\u00e1n vac\u00edos\u201d. En la misma l\u00ednea, Josefina Maestu, economista de la Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, advierte: \u201cAhora en muchos casos lo que vemos son embalses que est\u00e1n sobredimensionados o no se llenan, por eso la soluci\u00f3n est\u00e1 m\u00e1s en utilizar mejor los embalses que ya tenemos y no en construir nuevos\u201d. Los planes hidrol\u00f3gicos estatales actuales, que son la mayor\u00eda y abarcan hasta 2027, prev\u00e9n la construcci\u00f3n de una decena de presas. Pero la mayor\u00eda son obras de laminaci\u00f3n, es decir, para prevenir avenidas e inundaciones. De hecho, de la planificaci\u00f3n se eliminaron 85<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> embalses zombis </emphasis>que no est\u00e1 previsto que se ejecuten.  Para Gonzalo Delac\u00e1mara, director del Center for Water &amp; Climate Adaptation de la IE University de Madrid, \u201cque se siga hablando de recurrir a los embalses o a los trasvases es una concepci\u00f3n un poco arcaica de la pol\u00edtica de agua\u201d. En su opini\u00f3n, esto no quiere decir que haya que parar las casi 40 transferencias que existen, pero considera que no tienen sentido grandes inversiones en este \u00e1mbito. \u201cHay quienes creen que todo se solucionar\u00eda interconectando todas las cuencas. Es pensamiento m\u00e1gico\u201d. En el 2020/2021, unos 900 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos fueron trasvasados entre cuencas. Las cedentes son las del Tajo, Ebro y Guadiana, mientras que las principales receptoras son Segura, Cant\u00e1brico Oriental y Tinto, Odiel y Piedras. Pese a existir esas cuatro decenas de trasvases, m\u00e1s del 90% del volumen trasvasado se produce a trav\u00e9s de seis transferencias. \u00bfLa soluci\u00f3n pasa entonces  por hacer m\u00e1s trasvases? Mor\u00e1n no lo cree: \u201cEsa especie de retrato id\u00edlico de que existe un pa\u00eds en el que sobra el agua en unos territorios y entonces es posible llevarla a otros no se corresponde con la realidad. Todas las demarcaciones tienen demandas en estos momentos por encima de sus propias capacidades para atenderlas\u201d, afirma. Maestu coincide: \u201cEs llevar sequ\u00eda de un lado para otro\u201d. La economista recuerda cuando el trasvase desde la cabecera del Tajo al Segura \u2014la m\u00e1s pol\u00e9mica de las transferencias entre cuencas\u2014 se paraliz\u00f3 durante 10 meses por la sequ\u00eda de 2017 y 2018.  Los embalses o los trasvases son muy dependientes de la meteorolog\u00eda, pero las desaladoras basta ponerlas en marcha para que empiecen a  producir agua. Esto las convierte en algunos casos en un seguro de vida contra la escasez h\u00eddrica. Sin embargo deben estar junto al mar y hace falta una demanda continuada de esa agua desalada. Se han construido algunas plantas en Espa\u00f1a luego infrautilizadas. \u201cLas desaladoras de \u00c1guilas y Torrevieja, las dos m\u00e1s grandes de Europa, est\u00e1n funcionando casi al 100%, pues un porcentaje elevado de su producci\u00f3n va hacia la agricultura, que es una demanda que no cesa\u201d, se\u00f1ala Domingo Zarzo, presidente de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Desalaci\u00f3n y Reutilizaci\u00f3n (AEDyR). \u201cPero se han hecho algunas plantas que quiz\u00e1 no han respondido a las necesidades\u201d, a\u00f1ade. La cuesti\u00f3n clave es el precio del agua. Zarzo defiende que no se puede considerar caro pagar 0,7 o 0,8 euros por mil litros de agua desalada. Seg\u00fan Delac\u00e1mara, puede subir a dos o tres euros si se incluye la inversi\u00f3n para llevar el l\u00edquido hasta una parcela agr\u00edcola. Eso resta competitividad si se compara con los entre 0,09 y 0,15 euros por metro c\u00fabico que cuesta bombear agua de un pozo. \u201cAh\u00ed tenemos una contradicci\u00f3n que resolver, la desalaci\u00f3n es una fuente much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s previsible y planificable, pero ha estado subutilizada porque no hemos resuelto el problema de los precios\u201d, recalca Delac\u00e1mara. \u201cHay que redise\u00f1ar los incentivos, como se hizo para impulsar las energ\u00edas renovables frente a los combustibles f\u00f3siles\u201d. Aparte de los incentivos, el director de AEDyR relata otra forma de reducir los costes. \u201cEl 60% del precio del agua desalada viene del consumo de energ\u00eda, hay que implementar renovables. Es dif\u00edcil avanzar m\u00e1s en eficiencia o en la reducci\u00f3n del consumo energ\u00e9tico en las de\u00adsa\u00adla\u00addo\u00adras porque ya estamos casi en el l\u00edmite de lo que se puede conseguir, pero el uso de renovables s\u00ed puede abaratar la energ\u00eda que utilizan, ah\u00ed es donde hay que trabajar\u201d. En mayo del a\u00f1o pasado, el Gobierno aprob\u00f3 600 millones para instalar parques solares en plantas desaladoras. Espa\u00f1a es el primer pa\u00eds europeo en desalaci\u00f3n, con una producci\u00f3n de entre 560 y 575 hm\u00b3, de los que m\u00e1s del 40% est\u00e1n ubicados en la demarcaci\u00f3n del Segura. La previsi\u00f3n es que se duplique esta d\u00e9cada. Pero esos 1.000 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos futuros son una peque\u00f1a parte del consumo si se compara con los 30.000 de la demanda anual. Mor\u00e1n advierte: \u201cTenemos que romper con ese mantra que se est\u00e1 incorporando de que la tecnolog\u00eda lo va a resolver todo. Decir \u2018ponga una desaladora en su vida para cada uno de los ciudadanos del pa\u00eds\u2019 no es viable, no es ni f\u00edsica, ni t\u00e9cnica, ni econ\u00f3micamente posible\u201d  Otra fuente no convencional es la reutilizaci\u00f3n de aguas residuales depuradas. Esto implica depurar a una calidad superior lo que llega al alcantarillado para utilizarlo en agricultura, jardines, baldeo de calles o industria. Hoy es viable depurar el agua de v\u00e1ter para que se pueda beber, aunque la legislaci\u00f3n no lo permite.  Por el momento, el porcentaje de reutilizaci\u00f3n de las aguas residuales tratadas en el conjunto del pa\u00eds es del 10% y el real decreto de medidas urgentes contra la sequ\u00eda de mayo de 2023 establece como objetivo llegar al 20% en tres a\u00f1os, hasta alcanzar los 1.000 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos anuales en 2027. Entre todas las regiones, destaca Murcia, que reutiliza el 98% de lo que sale de sus depuradoras, o el de la Comunidad Valenciana, la regi\u00f3n europea con un mayor volumen de agua reutilizada (271,54 hm\u00b3). A pesar de estos n\u00fameros, Delac\u00e1mara considera que en reutilizaci\u00f3n se ha perdido una d\u00e9cada. \u201cAhora mismo tenemos una capacidad de reutilizaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a de 400 millones de metros c\u00fabicos al a\u00f1o [400 hm\u00b3], que es la mayor de Europa, pero tambi\u00e9n pr\u00e1cticamente el mismo dato que hace 10 a\u00f1os\u201d, incide el economista. \u201cHay que reutilizar hasta la \u00faltima gota de agua all\u00ed donde se pueda\u201d, incide el director de AEDyR, que tambi\u00e9n considera demasiado modesto el objetivo del 20%.  La reutilizaci\u00f3n resulta especialmente interesante en el sector de la industria o en n\u00facleos urbanos que viertan sus aguas residuales al mar. Pero puede ser un problema si esto se traduce en una reducci\u00f3n del caudal de las depuradoras que va a parar ahora a los r\u00edos, donde esa agua \u201cdebe ayudar a reponer la disponibilidad de recursos de las masas superficiales y las subterr\u00e1neas\u201d, a\u00f1ade Mor\u00e1n.  \u201cEl primer camino que hay que recorrer es el de la eficiencia. Hay que incorporar toda la capacidad de gesti\u00f3n \u00f3ptima del recurso y empezar a pensar en el agua como un elemento m\u00e1s dentro de la estrategia de circularidad para que no se desperdicie ni una sola gota, y evidentemente ninguno de los sectores est\u00e1 exento de tener que abordar esta transici\u00f3n hidrol\u00f3gica\u201d, resume Mor\u00e1n. \u201cSi hablamos de que hay que reducir demanda, todos los usuarios deben hacerlo, el agrario es el mayor usuario, por tanto su ahorro agregado ser\u00e1 l\u00f3gicamente mayor\u201d, a\u00f1ade. El Gobierno defiende que, tras d\u00e9cadas expansivas en las que el regad\u00edo no ha parado de crecer pese a las sequ\u00edas, en los nuevos planes hidrol\u00f3gicos se rompe con esa tendencia. \u201cPara el conjunto de las demarcaciones hidrogr\u00e1ficas intercomunitarias se ha pasado de algo m\u00e1s de 28.000 hm\u00b3 al a\u00f1o de asignaci\u00f3n a unos 26.300 hm\u00b3\u201d, se indica en la planificaci\u00f3n hidrol\u00f3gica vigente. Ese recorte, apunta el ministerio, afecta principalmente a \u201clos regad\u00edos expectantes no desarrollados\u201d. Maestu considera que Espa\u00f1a debe replantearse su sistema agrario y \u201credimensionarlo\u201d. Los ecologistas apuntan a la necesidad de reducir el regad\u00edo. Alberto Garrido, director del Observatorio del Agua de la Fundaci\u00f3n Bot\u00edn, rechaza esa postura: \u201cNo hay que parar, hay que consolidar el regad\u00edo, no dejarlo crecer m\u00e1s, pero pensar en quitar regad\u00edo no tiene mucho sentido\u201d. En lugar de eliminarlos, propone es ajustar el riego a la disponibilidad de agua de cada a\u00f1o. \u201cSe trata de ser m\u00e1s resilientes, m\u00e1s adaptativos, para que las autoridades hidr\u00e1ulicas puedan decir a los agricultores este a\u00f1o ustedes tienen 1.500 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos, 1.000, 2.000\u2026\u201d.       </p>", "publisher": "El Pais", "instances": ["Pero la mayor\u00eda son obras de laminaci\u00f3n, es decir, para prevenir avenidas e inundaciones.

En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, una oleada de fen\u00f3menos clim\u00e1ticos extremos, como sequ\u00edas devastadoras en \u00c1frica oriental e inundaciones catastr\u00f3ficas en \u00c1frica occidental, han contribuido a reducir el crecimiento econ\u00f3mico y aumentar la desigualdad de ingresos con los pa\u00edses ricos, principalmente al erosionar la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Si bien existen numerosas innovaciones para ayudar a los peque\u00f1os agricultores de la regi\u00f3n, menos del 2 % de la financiaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica global se dedica a cubrir sus necesidades.\"Necesitamos hacer grandes apuestas en innovaci\u00f3n para garantizar que los peque\u00f1os agricultores del \u00c1frica subsahariana y Asia meridional tengan las herramientas que necesitan para adaptar sus pr\u00e1cticas, alimentar a su gente y desarrollar resiliencia frente al cambio clim\u00e1tico\", afirm\u00f3 Gates. \"Las necesidades de los agricultores son una parte integral de la agenda clim\u00e1tica global\".CGIAR, la red de investigaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola financiada con fondos p\u00fablicos m\u00e1s grande del mundo, desempe\u00f1a un papel fundamental en el apoyo a la producci\u00f3n de alimentos resiliente y sostenible en un mundo sometido a estr\u00e9s clim\u00e1tico.

En 2021, se emplearon en el pa\u00eds 32.024 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos (hm\u00b3) en los llamados usos consuntivos: abastecimiento urbano, uso agrario e industrial. Y, a mucha distancia del resto, el primer consumidor es el sector agrario: ese a\u00f1o consumi\u00f3 el 73,5% de todos los recursos.

En los \u00faltimos meses, los recortes ya han llegado a esa \u00faltima fase en amplias zonas de Catalu\u00f1a y Andaluc\u00eda. Pero, pensando en una situaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s complicada en el futuro, \u00bfes posible evitar los recortes? \u00bfSe pueden construir m\u00e1s embalses? \u00bfHay que apostar por m\u00e1s trasvases? \u00bfLa soluci\u00f3n es la desalaci\u00f3n o las aguas regeneradas?</p><p>A lo primero a lo que el ministerio apunta abiertamente es a rebajar la demanda. Advierte en su planificaci\u00f3n de que \"la reducci\u00f3n en la disponibilidad de agua para los distintos usos aconseja plantearse disminuciones de la utilizaci\u00f3n del agua del orden del 15%\" de aqu\u00ed a 2050. O lo que es lo mismo: recortes de tres puntos porcentuales \"en cada ciclo sexenal de planificaci\u00f3n\". Aunque no se descarta aumentar, por ejemplo, la capacidad de desalaci\u00f3n y reutilizaci\u00f3n.</p><h>Embalses y trasvases</h><p>\"Espa\u00f1a es el primer pa\u00eds de Europa en embalses y el quinto del mundo\", explica <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/clima-y-medio-ambiente/2023-03-01/la-frase-eolica-si-pero-no-asi-quiere-decir-en-realidad-eolica-si-pero-no-aqui.html\">Hugo Mor\u00e1n</url>, secretario de Estado de Medio Ambiente. La capacidad total de embalsado asciende a los 56.039 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos en el pa\u00eds. En estos momentos, la reserva nacional alcanza los 31.844 hm\u00b3, casi el 57%. Esta cantidad servir\u00eda para cubrir un a\u00f1o entero de consumo en teor\u00eda. Pero eso solo es teor\u00eda, porque en la pr\u00e1ctica hay un desequilibrio evidente que hace que haya zonas que respiran tranquilas -las cuencas del Duero y del Ebro est\u00e1n al 70%- mientras que otras est\u00e1n en una situaci\u00f3n complicad\u00edsima, como las cuencas mediterr\u00e1neas andaluzas, Guadalete, Segura y Internas de Catalu\u00f1a, que no llegan ni al 20% de la reserva.</p><p>\u00bfLa soluci\u00f3n, entonces, son m\u00e1s pantanos? Mor\u00e1n no descarta que sea posible constru\u00edr m\u00e1s embalses. Pero no cree que sea \" aconsejable\" por \"razones de car\u00e1cter ambiental, social y econ\u00f3mico\". Entre otras cosas, porque las normas europeas obligan a que se mantengan unos caudales m\u00ednimos en los r\u00edos para conservar la biodiversidad. Pero Mor\u00e1n insiste: \"El problema que tenemos ahora no es de embalses, es de agua; el problema es que los embalses est\u00e1n vac\u00edos\". En la misma l\u00ednea, Josefina Maestu, economista de la Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, advierte: \"Ahora en muchos casos lo que vemos embalses que est\u00e1n sobredimensionados o no se llenan, por eso la soluci\u00f3n est\u00e1 m\u00e1s en utilizar mejor los embalses que ya tenemos y no en construir nuevos\".</p><p>Los planes hidrol\u00f3gicos estatales actuales, que son la mayor\u00eda y abarcan hasta 2027, prev\u00e9n la construcci\u00f3n de una decena de presas. Pero la mayor\u00eda son obras de laminaci\u00f3n, es decir, para prevenir avenidas e inundaciones.

En su opini\u00f3n, esto no quiere decir que haya que parar las cerca de 40 transferencias que existen hoy en d\u00eda en Espa\u00f1a, pero considera que no tiene sentido realizar grandes inversiones en este \u00e1mbito. \"Hay quienes creen que todo se solucionar\u00eda interconectando todas las cuencas. Es pensamiento m\u00e1gico\".</p><p>En el a\u00f1o hidrol\u00f3gico 2020/2021, alrededor de 900 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos fueron trasvasados entre cuencas. Las principales cuencas cedentes son las del Tajo, Ebro y Guadiana, mientras que las principales receptoras, son las del Segura, Cant\u00e1brico Oriental y Tinto, Odiel y Piedras. Pese a existir esas cuatro decenas de trasvases m\u00e1s del 90% del volumen trasvasado se produce a trav\u00e9s de seis transferencias.</p><p>\u00bfLa soluci\u00f3n son entonces m\u00e1s trasvases? Mor\u00e1n no lo cree: \"Esa especie de retrato id\u00edlico de que existe un pa\u00eds en el que sobra el agua en unos territorios y entonces es posible llevarla a otros no se corresponde con la realidad. Todas las demarcaciones tienen demandas en estos momentos por encima de sus propias capacidades para atenderlas\". \"Es llevar sequ\u00eda de un lado para otro\", remacha Maestu, que recuerda cuando el trasvase desde la cabecera del Tajo al Segura -la m\u00e1s pol\u00e9mica de las transferencias entre cuencas- <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/03/20/actualidad/1521546377_400490.html\">se paraliz\u00f3 durante 10 meses por la sequ\u00eda de 2017 y 2018</url>.</p><h>Desalaci\u00f3n</h><p>A diferencia de los embalses o los trasvases, muy dependientes de la meteorolog\u00eda, en el caso de <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/clima-y-medio-ambiente/2022-08-19/el-gobierno-aumentara-un-17-la-capacidad-de-desalinizacion-marina-para-garantizar-el-riego-en-el-sureste-de-espana.html\">las desaladoras</url> basta ponerlas en marcha para empezar a producir agua. Esto las convierte en algunos casos en un seguro de vida contra la escasez h\u00eddrica. Sin embargo, tampoco se pueden construir desaladoras en cualquier parte; no solo porque deben estar junto al mar, sino tambi\u00e9n porque hace falta que haya una demanda continuada de esa agua desalada. De hecho, en Espa\u00f1a se han construido algunas plantas luego infrautilizadas.</p><p>\"Las desaladoras de \u00c1guilas y Torrevieja, que son las dos m\u00e1s grandes de Europa, est\u00e1n funcionando pr\u00e1cticamente al 100% de capacidad, pues un porcentaje elevado de su producci\u00f3n va hacia la agricultura, que es una demanda que no cesa y por eso estas plantas est\u00e1n a tope\", se\u00f1ala Domingo Zarzo, presidente de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Desalaci\u00f3n y Reutilizaci\u00f3n (AEDyR). \"Pero se han hecho algunas plantas que quiz\u00e1 no han respondido a las necesidades\", a\u00f1ade.</p><p>La cuesti\u00f3n clave, sin embargo, es el precio del agua. Zarzo defiende que no se puede considerar caro pagar 0,7 o 0,8 euros por mil litros de agua desalada, un metro c\u00fabico. Seg\u00fan Delac\u00e1mara, ese coste puede subir a dos o tres euros si se incluye la inversi\u00f3n requerida para llevar el l\u00edquido hasta una parcela agr\u00edcola. Eso resta competitividad si se compara con los entre 0,09 y 0,15 euros por metro c\u00fabico que le cuesta a un agricultor bombear agua directamente de un pozo. \"Ah\u00ed tenemos una contradicci\u00f3n que resolver, la desalaci\u00f3n es una fuente much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s previsible y planificable, pero tradicionalmente ha estado subutilizada porque no hemos resuelto el problema de los precios\", recalca Delac\u00e1mara. \"Hay que redise\u00f1ar los incentivos, como se hizo en su d\u00eda para impulsar las energ\u00edas renovables en el sector de la energ\u00eda frente a <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/clima-y-medio-ambiente/2023-12-13/la-presidencia-de-la-cop28-intenta-desbloquear-la-cumbre-propone-transitar-hacia-el-fin-de-los-combustibles-fosiles.html\">los combustibles f\u00f3siles</url>\".</p><p>Aparte de los incentivos, el director de AEDyR explica que existe otra forma de reducir los costes. \"El 60% del precio del agua desalada viene del consumo de energ\u00eda, lo que hay que hacer es implementar renovables. Es dif\u00edcil avanzar m\u00e1s en eficiencia o en la reducci\u00f3n del consumo energ\u00e9tico en las desaladoras porque ya estamos pr\u00e1cticamente en el l\u00edmite de lo que se puede conseguir t\u00e9cnicamente, pero el uso de renovables s\u00ed puede abaratar la energ\u00eda que utilizan, ah\u00ed es donde hay que trabajar\". El pasado mayo, el Gobierno aprob\u00f3 600 millones para instalar parques solares en plantas de desalaci\u00f3n.</p><p>Espa\u00f1a es el primer pa\u00eds europeo en desalaci\u00f3n, con una producci\u00f3n de entre 560 y 575 hm\u00b3, de los que m\u00e1s del 40% est\u00e1n ubicados en la demarcaci\u00f3n del Segura. Las previsiones del Gobierno es que esa capacidad se duplique esta d\u00e9cada. Pero esos 1.000 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos futuros siguen representando una peque\u00f1a parte del consumo si se compara con los 30.000 de la demanda anual. Mor\u00e1n advierte adem\u00e1s: \"Tenemos que romper con esa especie de mantra que se est\u00e1 incorporando de que la tecnolog\u00eda lo va a resolver todo. Decir 'ponga una desaladora en su vida para cada uno de los ciudadanos del pa\u00eds' no es viable, no es ni f\u00edsica, ni t\u00e9cnica, ni econ\u00f3micamente posible\".</p><h>Reutilizaci\u00f3n</h><p>Otra fuente no convencional es la reutilizaci\u00f3n de aguas residuales depuradas. Esto implica depurar a una calidad superior lo que llega al alcantarillado de las ciudades para poder utilizarlo en agricultura, jardines, baldeo de calles o industria.

Entre todas las regiones, destaca el caso de Murcia, que <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/clima-y-medio-ambiente/2023-05-21/agua-del-mar-y-residuales-los-recursos-hidricos-que-no-bajan-con-la-sequia.html\">reutiliza el 98% de lo que sale de sus depuradoras</url>, o el de la Comunidad Valenciana, la regi\u00f3n europea con un mayor volumen de agua reutilizada (271,54 hm\u00b3).</p><p>A pesar de estos n\u00fameros, Delac\u00e1mara considera que en reutilizaci\u00f3n se ha perdido una d\u00e9cada. \"Ahora mismo tenemos una capacidad de reutilizaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a de 400 millones de metros c\u00fabicos al a\u00f1o [400 hm3], que es la mayor de Europa, pero tambi\u00e9n pr\u00e1cticamente el mismo dato que hace 10 a\u00f1os\", incide el economista. \"Hay que reutilizar hasta la \u00faltima gota de agua all\u00ed donde se pueda\", incide el director de AEDyR, que tambi\u00e9n considera demasiado modesto el objetivo del 20%. La reutilizaci\u00f3n resulta especialmente interesante en el sector de la industria o en n\u00facleos urbanos que viertan sus aguas residuales al mar. Pero puede ser un problema si esto se traduce en una reducci\u00f3n del caudal de las depuradoras que va a parar ahora a los r\u00edos, donde ese agua \"debe ayudar a reponer la disponibilidad de recursos de las masas superficiales y las subterr\u00e1neas\", a\u00f1ade Mor\u00e1n.</p><h>Reducci\u00f3n y eficiencia</h><p>\"El primer camino que hay que recorrer es el de la eficiencia.

Ese recorte, apunta el ministerio, afecta principalmente a \"los regad\u00edos expectantes no desarrollados\". Maeztu considera que Espa\u00f1a debe replantearse su sistema agrario y \"redimensionarlo\".

Un 9% del agua potable que sale por los grifos del pa\u00eds procede ya del mar y un porcentaje similar de las aguas residuales procedentes de los v\u00e1teres son depuradas con una calidad que permite regar incluso lechugas que se van a comer, de acuerdo a los datos de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Desalaci\u00f3n y Reutilizaci\u00f3n (AEDyR). Espa\u00f1a no solo encabeza la clasificaci\u00f3n europea de n\u00famero de grandes presas construidas, tambi\u00e9n de desalaci\u00f3n y de reutilizaci\u00f3n de agua regenerada (de mayor calidad que la depurada convencional), recursos que son m\u00e1s caros, pero tienen la ventaja de que no disminuyen con la sequ\u00eda.</p><p>Al contrario, la previsi\u00f3n es que sigan ganando protagonismo en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os.

Como destaca Domingo Zarzo, presidente de AEDyR, \"si no tuvi\u00e9ramos desaladoras, ahora mismo habr\u00eda restricciones en el abastecimiento en toda la costa mediterr\u00e1nea\". En cuanto al aprovechamiento de las aguas residuales, llama mucho la atenci\u00f3n el caso de Murcia, que reutiliza el 98% de lo que sale de sus depuradoras (frente al 9% de media en Espa\u00f1a o el 5% en Europa), o de la Comunidad Valenciana, la regi\u00f3n europea con un mayor volumen de agua reutilizada (271,54 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos).</p><p>Estos recursos pueden superar en calidad al agua convencional que se usa a veces en el pa\u00eds y suponen un alivio indudable para zonas \u00e1ridas, sobre todo, en un momento cr\u00edtico como el actual. Sin embargo, algunos expertos advierten del peligro de aumentar la oferta de recursos h\u00eddricos sin arreglar tambi\u00e9n los agujeros en las tuber\u00edas del sistema. En opini\u00f3n de Julia Mart\u00ednez, directora t\u00e9cnica de la Fundaci\u00f3n Nueva Cultura del Agua, \"la clave para adaptarnos al cambio clim\u00e1tico es pasar de pol\u00edticas de oferta a gesti\u00f3n de la demanda, lo que implica reducir las necesidades de agua en todos los usos, en el abastecimiento humano, en las industrias y, muy especialmente, en el regad\u00edo, que se est\u00e1 bebiendo ahora mismo el 80% del agua en Espa\u00f1a\". Adem\u00e1s, esta bi\u00f3loga defiende que la reutilizaci\u00f3n no genera en realidad ning\u00fan recurso nuevo en el conjunto del sistema, pues en caso de no reutilizarse, la mayor parte del agua de las depuradoras se vierte a los r\u00edos para que se diluya. Considera que s\u00ed implica una ganancia cuando se evita el vertido de una depuradora al mar, pero no cuando el agua depurada se deja de verter a un r\u00edo del que se va a seguir extrayendo los mismos metros c\u00fabicos m\u00e1s abajo.</p><p>\"Si lanzamos el mensaje de que somos capaces de generar un recurso adicional y eso lo que hace es desbocar las demandas, lo que estamos haciendo es lanzar justo la se\u00f1al que no quer\u00edamos\", destaca tambi\u00e9n Gonzalo Delac\u00e1mara, director del Centre for Water and Climate Adaptation de la Universidad IE, en Madrid, que opina que el aumento de la disponibilidad de agua desalada y reutilizada deber\u00eda ir acompa\u00f1ada de una reducci\u00f3n de la presi\u00f3n sobre acu\u00edferos sobreexplotados y los ecosistemas naturales.</p><p>Tras el fuerte impulso dado por el Gobierno central entre 2004 y 2011, la capacidad actual de desalaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a es de cerca de cinco millones de metros c\u00fabicos al d\u00eda, un potencial solo superado en el mundo por Arabia Saud\u00ed, otros pa\u00edses del Golfo P\u00e9rsico y Estados Unidos. Seg\u00fan los datos de AEDyR, en Espa\u00f1a hay m\u00e1s de 770 desaladoras con capacidad para generar m\u00e1s de 100 metros c\u00fabicos al d\u00eda y 100 de ellas de m\u00e1s 10.000 metros c\u00fabicos al d\u00eda. La planta m\u00e1s grande es la de Torrevieja (de 240.000 metros c\u00fabicos al d\u00eda), gestionada por la empresa estatal Acuamed, que funciona ahora mismo a pleno rendimiento para cubrir las solicitudes tramitadas por los regantes. El pasado mes de abril, esta instalaci\u00f3n produjo 6,7 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos.</p><p>Como recalca Zarzo, de todo el agua desalada ahora mismo en el pa\u00eds un 21% se destina a la agricultura, lo que supone \"una rareza\" en el resto del mundo (donde apenas se utiliza un 3% para el riego de cultivos). \"Viene mucha gente de Australia, Chile u otros pa\u00edses para ver aqu\u00ed instalaciones de desalaci\u00f3n para agricultura y cultivos regados con agua desalada, somos un ejemplo a nivel mundial\", incide el presidente de AEDyR, que explica que la barrera no es ya tecnol\u00f3gica (pues si bien el agua desalada resulta problem\u00e1tica por contener boro -un nutriente que puede resultar t\u00f3xico para algunos cultivos-, este asegura que las grandes plantas de Acuamed son capaces de retirarlo), sino econ\u00f3mica, al depender de que los cultivos sean suficientemente rentables para pagar esta agua m\u00e1s cara.</p><p>Aunque los precios pueden variar mucho, seg\u00fan Delac\u00e1mara, un metro c\u00fabico de agua reutilizada puede costar a la salida de la depuradora unos 35-50 c\u00e9ntimos de euros y un metro c\u00fabico de agua desalada unos 90 c\u00e9ntimos (sin contar el transporte hasta la zona a regar), mientras que bombear un metro c\u00fabico de agua convencional en una parcela puede suponer apenas 10 c\u00e9ntimos. \"A veces los regantes prefieren pagar menos y regar sus limones o sus lechugas con lo que bombean de un acu\u00edfero sobreexplotado, aunque tenga altos niveles de salinidad o pueda estar contaminado por nitratos\", incide este economista, que considera que hacen falta incentivos para promover que el riego sea m\u00e1s sostenible. \"Si lo que se quiere es no resolver solo el problema a corto plazo, sino garantizar la seguridad h\u00eddrica a largo plazo en un contexto de adaptaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica, hace falta un sistema de precios que permita entrar en el mercado a opciones m\u00e1s costosas, como se hizo con las renovables para desplazar a los combustibles f\u00f3siles\", argumenta. \"Siempre claro que sean realmente m\u00e1s sostenibles, si es una planta desaladora que no trata su salmuera</p><p>[residuo salino generado por estas instalaciones], entonces mejor no utilizarla\".</p><p>Eliminar pat\u00f3genos</p><p>En el caso de la reutilizaci\u00f3n, la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Abastecimiento de Agua y Saneamiento (AEAS) estima que el 61,9% del agua regenerada se emplea en agricultura, el 18% en jardines y zonas de ocio, un 2% en industria, limpieza de alcantarillado y baldeo de calles, y un 0,82% en la recarga de acu\u00edferos. La tecnolog\u00eda actual ya es capaz de depurar el agua del v\u00e1ter con una calidad tambi\u00e9n suficiente para beberla. Sin embargo, la legislaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola no lo permite de momento, lo que s\u00ed ocurre en sitios como Singapur.</p><p>En Murcia, casi la totalidad de sus 121 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos reutilizados al a\u00f1o se dedican a la agricultura. De hecho, un 15% de toda el agua con la que se riega en esta comunidad sale de las depuradoras, seg\u00fan Esamur, la empresa p\u00fablica que se encarga del saneamiento en la regi\u00f3n. Como explica Pedro Sim\u00f3n, su director t\u00e9cnico, si bien hoy en d\u00eda se depura casi toda el agua urbana en el pa\u00eds, aquella que se va a reutilizar debe pasar por un tratamiento a\u00f1adido para eliminar tambi\u00e9n pat\u00f3genos. Esto tiene unos mayores costes que la depuraci\u00f3n normal, que al igual que ocurre en la Comunidad Valenciana o en Catalu\u00f1a, son sufragados con un canon de saneamiento que pagan todos los ciudadanos.

Un 9% del agua potable que sale por los grifos del pa\u00eds procede ya del mar y un porcentaje similar de las aguas residuales procedentes de los v\u00e1teres son depuradas con una calidad que permite regar incluso lechugas que se van a comer, de acuerdo a los datos de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Desalaci\u00f3n y Reutilizaci\u00f3n (AEDyR). Espa\u00f1a no solo encabeza la clasificaci\u00f3n europea de n\u00famero de grandes presas construidas, tambi\u00e9n de desalaci\u00f3n y de reutilizaci\u00f3n de agua regenerada (de mayor calidad que la depurada convencional), recursos que son m\u00e1s caros, pero tienen la ventaja de que no disminuyen con la sequ\u00eda.</p><p>Al contrario, la previsi\u00f3n es que sigan ganando protagonismo en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os. Si ya estaba prevista la ampliaci\u00f3n de algunas de las grandes desaladoras (como la de Torrevieja, en Alicante, o la de \u00c1guilas, en Murcia), el Real Decreto-ley 4/2023 contra la sequ\u00eda aprobado la semana pasada por el Gobierno con ayudas para los agricultores incluye tambi\u00e9n 440 millones de euros para la construcci\u00f3n de tres nuevas plantas desalinizadoras (en Blanes, Girona; en Almer\u00eda y en M\u00e1laga), 600 millones para instalar parques solares en desaladoras ya en funcionamiento, 180 millones para mejoras en dos depuradoras de Alicante y otras medidas para que la reutilizaci\u00f3n de agua regenerada crezca un 150% de aqu\u00ed a 2027, pasando de los actuales 400 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos a cerca de 1.000.</p><p>Muy por delante en el desarrollo de estas tecnolog\u00edas, hay puntos del pa\u00eds -en la costa peninsular y las islas- en los que estas otras aguas resultan estrat\u00e9gicas desde hace tiempo. Como destaca Domingo Zarzo, presidente de AEDyR, \"si no tuvi\u00e9ramos desaladoras, ahora mismo habr\u00eda restricciones en el abastecimiento en toda la costa mediterr\u00e1nea\". En cuanto al aprovechamiento de las aguas residuales, llama mucho la atenci\u00f3n el caso de Murcia, que reutiliza el 98% de lo que sale de sus depuradoras (frente al 9% de media en Espa\u00f1a o el 5% en Europa), o de la Comunidad Valenciana, la regi\u00f3n europea con un mayor volumen de agua reutilizada (271,54 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos).</p><p>Estos recursos pueden superar en calidad al agua convencional que se usa a veces en el pa\u00eds y suponen un alivio indudable para zonas \u00e1ridas, sobre todo, en un momento cr\u00edtico como el actual. Sin embargo, algunos expertos advierten del peligro de aumentar la oferta de recursos h\u00eddricos sin arreglar tambi\u00e9n los agujeros en las tuber\u00edas del sistema. En opini\u00f3n de Julia Mart\u00ednez, directora t\u00e9cnica de la Fundaci\u00f3n Nueva Cultura del Agua, \"la clave para adaptarnos al cambio clim\u00e1tico es pasar de pol\u00edticas de oferta a gesti\u00f3n de la demanda, lo que implica reducir las necesidades de agua en todos los usos, en el abastecimiento humano, en las industrias y, muy especialmente, en el regad\u00edo, que se est\u00e1 bebiendo ahora mismo el 80% del agua en Espa\u00f1a\". Adem\u00e1s, esta bi\u00f3loga defiende que la reutilizaci\u00f3n no genera en realidad ning\u00fan recurso nuevo en el conjunto del sistema, pues en caso de no reutilizarse, la mayor parte del agua de las depuradoras se vierte a los r\u00edos para que se diluya. Considera que s\u00ed implica una ganancia cuando se evita el vertido de una depuradora al mar, pero no cuando el agua depurada se deja de verter a un r\u00edo del que se va a seguir extrayendo los mismos metros c\u00fabicos m\u00e1s abajo.</p><p>\"Si lanzamos el mensaje de que somos capaces de generar un recurso adicional y eso lo que hace es desbocar las demandas, lo que estamos haciendo es lanzar justo la se\u00f1al que no quer\u00edamos\", destaca tambi\u00e9n Gonzalo Delac\u00e1mara, director del Centre for Water and Climate Adaptation de la Universidad IE, en Madrid, que opina que el aumento de la disponibilidad de agua desalada y reutilizada deber\u00eda ir acompa\u00f1ada de una reducci\u00f3n de la presi\u00f3n sobre acu\u00edferos sobreexplotados y los ecosistemas naturales.</p><p>Tras el fuerte impulso dado por el Gobierno central entre 2004 y 2011, la capacidad actual de desalaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a es de cerca de cinco millones de metros c\u00fabicos al d\u00eda, un potencial solo superado en el mundo por Arabia Saud\u00ed, otros pa\u00edses del Golfo P\u00e9rsico y Estados Unidos. Seg\u00fan los datos de AEDyR, en Espa\u00f1a hay m\u00e1s de 770 desaladoras con capacidad para generar m\u00e1s de 100 metros c\u00fabicos al d\u00eda y 100 de ellas de m\u00e1s 10.000 metros c\u00fabicos al d\u00eda. La planta m\u00e1s grande es la de Torrevieja (de 240.000 metros c\u00fabicos al d\u00eda), gestionada por la empresa estatal Acuamed, que funciona ahora mismo a pleno rendimiento para cubrir las solicitudes tramitadas por los regantes. El pasado mes de abril, esta instalaci\u00f3n produjo 6,7 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos.</p><p>Como recalca Zarzo, de todo el agua desalada ahora mismo en el pa\u00eds un 21% se destina a la agricultura, lo que supone \"una rareza\" en el resto del mundo (donde apenas se utiliza un 3% para el riego de cultivos). \"Viene mucha gente de Australia, Chile u otros pa\u00edses para ver aqu\u00ed instalaciones de desalaci\u00f3n para agricultura y cultivos regados con agua desalada, somos un ejemplo a nivel mundial\", incide el presidente de AEDyR, que explica que la barrera no es ya tecnol\u00f3gica (pues si bien el agua desalada resulta problem\u00e1tica por contener boro -un nutriente que puede resultar t\u00f3xico para algunos cultivos-, este asegura que las grandes plantas de Acuamed son capaces de retirarlo), sino econ\u00f3mica, al depender de que los cultivos sean suficientemente rentables para pagar esta agua m\u00e1s cara.</p><p>Aunque los precios pueden variar mucho, seg\u00fan Delac\u00e1mara, un metro c\u00fabico de agua reutilizada puede costar a la salida de la depuradora unos 35-50 c\u00e9ntimos de euros y un metro c\u00fabico de agua desalada unos 90 c\u00e9ntimos (sin contar el transporte hasta la zona a regar), mientras que bombear un metro c\u00fabico de agua convencional en una parcela puede suponer apenas 10 c\u00e9ntimos. \"A veces los regantes prefieren pagar menos y regar sus limones o sus lechugas con lo que bombean de un acu\u00edfero sobreexplotado, aunque tenga altos niveles de salinidad o pueda estar contaminado por nitratos\", incide este economista, que considera que hacen falta incentivos para promover que el riego sea m\u00e1s sostenible. \"Si lo que se quiere es no resolver solo el problema a corto plazo, sino garantizar la seguridad h\u00eddrica a largo plazo en un contexto de adaptaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica, hace falta un sistema de precios que permita entrar en el mercado a opciones m\u00e1s costosas, como se hizo con las renovables para desplazar a los combustibles f\u00f3siles\", argumenta. \"Siempre claro que sean realmente m\u00e1s sostenibles, si es una planta desaladora que no trata su salmuera</p><p>[residuo salino generado por estas instalaciones], entonces mejor no utilizarla\".</p><p>Eliminar pat\u00f3genos</p><p>En el caso de la reutilizaci\u00f3n, la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Abastecimiento de Agua y Saneamiento (AEAS) estima que el 61,9% del agua regenerada se emplea en agricultura, el 18% en jardines y zonas de ocio, un 2% en industria, limpieza de alcantarillado y baldeo de calles, y un 0,82% en la recarga de acu\u00edferos. La tecnolog\u00eda actual ya es capaz de depurar el agua del v\u00e1ter con una calidad tambi\u00e9n suficiente para beberla. Sin embargo, la legislaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola no lo permite de momento, lo que s\u00ed ocurre en sitios como Singapur.</p><p>En Murcia, casi la totalidad de sus 121 hect\u00f3metros c\u00fabicos reutilizados al a\u00f1o se dedican a la agricultura. De hecho, un 15% de toda el agua con la que se riega en esta comunidad sale de las depuradoras, seg\u00fan Esamur, la empresa p\u00fablica que se encarga del saneamiento en la regi\u00f3n. Como explica Pedro Sim\u00f3n, su director t\u00e9cnico, si bien hoy en d\u00eda se depura casi toda el agua urbana en el pa\u00eds, aquella que se va a reutilizar debe pasar por un tratamiento a\u00f1adido para eliminar tambi\u00e9n pat\u00f3genos. Esto tiene unos mayores costes que la depuraci\u00f3n normal, que al igual que ocurre en la Comunidad Valenciana o en Catalu\u00f1a, son sufragados con un canon de saneamiento que pagan todos los ciudadanos. La particularidad de Murcia es que esta agua tratada con mayor calidad resulta hoy gratis para los agricultores, algo que puede cambiar por la entrada en vigor en junio de un nuevo reglamento europeo que aumenta todav\u00eda m\u00e1s los requisitos (y los costes) para la reutilizaci\u00f3n. \"Para m\u00ed el problema principal es de confianza\", explica Sim\u00f3n sobre los recelos que todav\u00eda existen sobre el uso de un recurso sacado de las aguas residuales.

A pesar de los esfuerzos y de la aprobaci\u00f3n de las actuaciones y mejoras de infraestructura en los planes hidrol\u00f3gicos, uno de los problemas fundamentales como pa\u00eds es que no acaban de ejecutarse y tenemos un enorme d\u00e9ficit de inversi\u00f3n , advirti\u00f3 Morcillo.</p><p>El ciclo urbano del agua avanza a distintas velocidades seg\u00fan las distintas ciudades o territorios, pero la gobernanza tiene un papel destacado. El presidente de Aeas recalc\u00f3 el ejemplo de las empresas p\u00fablicas metropolitanas o auton\u00f3micas:  Los modelos de agrupaci\u00f3n presentan ventajas respecto a los municipios que trabajan de forma aislada .</p><p>Un caso de \u00e9xito en este sentido es el de Valencia, que gracias al modelo de entidad metropolitana ha alcanzado una eficiencia h\u00eddrica del 85%. Adem\u00e1s,  nuestra experiencia dice que las concesiones pueden funcionar muy bien, siempre que no nazcan corrompidas o que el sector p\u00fablico no abandone su \u00e1mbito de actuaci\u00f3n , consider\u00f3 Elisa Val\u00eda, concejala responsable del Ciclo Integral del Agua y presidenta de la Emshi (Entidad Metropolitana de Servicios Hidr\u00e1ulicos) del Ayuntamiento de Valencia, que a\u00f1adi\u00f3 que Espa\u00f1a cuenta con empresas muy profesionales y punteras en el ciclo del agua a escala global.</p><p>Sobre la utilizaci\u00f3n de la tecnolog\u00eda y los datos, Elisa Val\u00eda coment\u00f3 que  la digitalizaci\u00f3n es una herramienta que te proporciona informaci\u00f3n sobre cada gota de agua que pasa por el sistema, pero es necesario contar con objetivos claros para que funcione bien .</p><p>En la misma l\u00ednea,  lo importante no es la digitalizaci\u00f3n en s\u00ed misma, sino para qu\u00e9 se hace. Antes la manera de gestionar era m\u00e1s correctiva, despu\u00e9s paso a ser preventiva y ahora es predictiva: Podemos saber qu\u00e9 ocurre gracias a la informaci\u00f3n en tiempo real , indic\u00f3 Juan Carlos Bl\u00e1zquez, director de Desarrollo de Negocio Nacional de Agua de Acciona. En paralelo, hizo hincapi\u00e9 en que  la formaci\u00f3n de los profesionales es un aspecto decisivo para el sector, en un momento de cambio de paradigma y de las formas de trabajar .</p><p>Aunque los servicios se presten a nivel local, Gonzalo de la C\u00e1mara, director del Centre for Water &amp; Climate Adaptation del IE, manifest\u00f3 que el enfoque de la pol\u00edtica del agua deber\u00eda ser m\u00e1s amplio:  Tendr\u00eda que vincularse a un objetivo superior: el desaf\u00edo de garantizar la seguridad h\u00eddrica a largo plazo, a la vez que se lucha contra el cambio clim\u00e1tico . Con casi una cuarta parte del pa\u00eds en riesgo de desertificaci\u00f3n, De la C\u00e1mara avis\u00f3 de que  el hecho de que el sistema sea tan bueno genera una distorsi\u00f3n en el modo de afrontar el problema. El ciclo urbano del agua debe mirar cada vez m\u00e1s a la cuenca .</p>", "publisher": "Expansion (Spain)", "instances": ["Antes la manera de gestionar era m\u00e1s correctiva, despu\u00e9s paso a ser preventiva y ahora es predictiva: Podemos saber qu\u00e9 ocurre gracias a la informaci\u00f3n en tiempo real , indic\u00f3 Juan Carlos Bl\u00e1zquez, director de Desarrollo de Negocio Nacional de Agua de Acciona.
