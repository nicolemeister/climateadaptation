Research shows that climate shifts from 1980-2008 reduced wheat harvests by 5.5%, and global wheat production falls 6% for every degree-centigrade increase in temperature.</p><p>Wheat science urgently requires enhanced investments to scale up genetic studies of wild relatives, utilizing next-generation breeding tools. These tools include gene sequencing technologies, big-data analytics, and remote sensing technologies. Satellite imagery makes the planet a laboratory, allowing researchers to monitor traits like plant growth or disease resistance globally. Artificial intelligence can super-charge breeding simulations and quickly identify promising genes that enhance climate-resilience.</p><p>The basic genetic resources are already available: more than 770,000 unique seed samples are stored in 155 seed banks across 78 countries. These samples represent the full scope of known wheat genetic diversity, from modern varieties to ancient wild relatives and landraces developed at the dawn of agriculture.</p><p>What's missing is funding to accelerate the search for specific genes and combinations that will fortify wheat against harsher conditions.

These ancient grasses have evolved intricate relationships with soil microbes largely absent in modern wheat.</p><p>Some wild wheat relatives can inhibit soil microbes that convert ammonium to nitrate. While both are usable nitrogen forms for plants, nitrate is more prone to loss through leaching or gaseous conversion. Slowing this process of conversion, called nitrification, has profound implications for sustainable agriculture, potentially mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, improving nitrogen-use efficiency, and decreasing synthetic fertilizer use.</p><p>As proof of concept, the first and only crop (so far) bred to promote microbiome interaction is wheat, using a gene from a wild relative (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leymus racemosus</emphasis>) to slow nitrification.</p><p>In addition, wild relatives often form more effective symbiotic relationships with beneficial soil fungi and bacteria, enhancing nutrient uptake, drought tolerance, and natural pest defenses. Reintroducing these traits could reduce chemical inputs while improving soil health and biodiversity.</p><p>The benefits extend beyond the field. Wheat varieties that use water and nutrients more efficiently could reduce agricultural runoff, protecting water bodies. Enhanced root systems could increase soil carbon sequestration, contributing to climate change mitigation.</p><p>By systematically exploring wild wheat's microbial interaction traits, wheat varieties can be developed that not only withstand<url normalizedValue=\"https://english.elpais.com/opinion/the-global-observer/2023-11-14/what-is-climate-sticker-shock.html\"> c</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://english.elpais.com/opinion/the-global-observer/2023-11-14/what-is-climate-sticker-shock.html\">limate challenges </url>but also actively contribute to environmental restoration.</p><p>This represents a paradigm shift from crop protection through chemicals to resilience through biological synergies. Indeed, even a fraction of the US $1.4 trillion spent annually on agrochemical crop protection could work wonders to fortify wheat against present and future challenges.</p><p>The path forward is clear: increased investment in researching wild wheat relatives can yield a new generation of wheat varieties that are not just climate-resilient, but also environmentally regenerative.

Ciudades de todo el mundo, desde Vancouver a Barcelona, Tirana y Boa Vista (Brasil), han adoptado elementos favorables a la infancia, y algunas, como Rotterdam, han cambiado profundamente como resultado del cambio de perspectiva.</p><p>En <url normalizedValue=\"https://globaldesigningcities.org/publication/designing-streets-for-kids-es/\">Shenzhen</url>, en el sur de China, se pidi\u00f3 a menores de 18 a\u00f1os que participaran en el redise\u00f1o de un parque local, sin permitir a los padres ofrecer orientaci\u00f3n u opiniones, utilizando diferentes t\u00e9cnicas para ni\u00f1os de distintas edades. Por ejemplo, a los menores de seis a\u00f1os se les hizo participar cont\u00e1ndoles cuentos y haci\u00e9ndoles preguntas. En Am\u00e9rica Latina, la <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redocara.com/talleres-esp--oficinas-pt\">Red OCARA</url>, que promueve experiencias y proyectos sobre ciudad, arte, arquitectura y espacio p\u00fablico en los que participan ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as, lanz\u00f3 un \"kit detector de obst\u00e1culos\" para involucrar a los ni\u00f1os en el redise\u00f1o de calles, con talleres de intervenci\u00f3n en espacios p\u00fablicos (por ejemplo, poniendo parches en las calles con baches).</p><p>En la ciudad estadounidense de Boulder (Colorado), una iniciativa lanzada en 2009 consigui\u00f3 que los ni\u00f1os participen directamente en la remodelaci\u00f3n de la ciudad, junto con urbanistas. Ni\u00f1os de tan solo cuatro a\u00f1os participaron en el redise\u00f1o del \u00c1rea C\u00edvica del centro de la ciudad. Los organizadores utilizaron excursiones, construcci\u00f3n de maquetas y cuestionarios con los ni\u00f1os mayores, y con los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os se limitaron a observar sus preferencias. En general, a los ni\u00f1os les gustaba un contacto m\u00e1s directo con la naturaleza: imaginaban una biblioteca en la copa de un \u00e1rbol para leer, rodeados de flores y p\u00e1jaros; imaginaban un puente transparente, donde pudieran pararse y observar el arroyo. Quer\u00edan tener m\u00e1s acceso a aventuras emocionantes, como enormes roc\u00f3dromos desde los que saltar o aterrizar en camas el\u00e1sticas. Y no quer\u00edan ni basura, ni bicicletas a toda velocidad, ni coches.</p><p>Parece bastante elocuente que nos est\u00e1n pidiendo a gritos renaturalizaci\u00f3n, movilidad activa, econom\u00eda circular, socializaci\u00f3n, espacios de arte y juego. De ese modo, se beneficiar\u00e1 nuestra salud y nos beneficiaremos todos -el comercio local incluido-.</p><p>Algunas ideas que proponen los ni\u00f1os son demasiado locas, claro: un parque hecho de caramelos, con puentes llenos de ca\u00f1ones que lanzan chorros de agua a los que van en kayak. El problema es que los adultos podemos ser igual de irracionales cuando se nos consulta sobre urbanismo, dice Mara Mintzer, directora y cofundadora de la iniciativa de Boulder, y no todas las sugerencias tienen por qu\u00e9 llegar al proyecto final. \"No podemos ni debemos esperar que los ni\u00f1os nos den todas las respuestas, ese es nuestro trabajo. No es f\u00e1cil hacerlo bien, con demasiada frecuencia el resultado es simb\u00f3lico o decorativo\", como dijo Gill.</p><p>No deber\u00edamos darnos palmaditas en la espalda cuando incluimos a los ni\u00f1os en la toma de decisiones como si fuera un gran logro. Simplemente deber\u00edamos incluirlos, del mismo modo que a todos los dem\u00e1s. Porque solo la gobernanza verdaderamente inclusiva tiene la llave del futuro, y la diversidad de la creatividad que nos llevar\u00e1 hasta su puerta. Porque solo habr\u00e1 revoluci\u00f3n jugando.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/autor/irene-caselli/\">\u00a0Irene Caselli </url>es periodista en la web <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thefirst1000days.news/\">The First 1.000 Days</url>. <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/autor/jesus-iglesias-saugar/\">Jes\u00fas Iglesias Saugar</url> es embajador del Pacto Clim\u00e1tico Europeo en la empresa social Nature-Based Solutions for climate resilience (SBNCLIMA).<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Puedes seguir a </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Planeta Futuro</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> en </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/Planeta_Futuro\">X</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/planetafuturoelpais/\">Facebook</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/planetafuturo/\">Instagram</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> y </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@elpais/playlist/Planeta%20Futuro-7250843912766573339\">TikTok</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> y suscribirte </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/309\">aqu\u00ed</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> a nuestra 'newsletter'</emphasis>.</p>", "publisher": "El Pais - Spanish (online)", "instances": ["Irene Caselli es periodista en la web The First 1. 000 Days.
