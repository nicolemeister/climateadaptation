Por ejemplo, la Bernard van Leer, una ONG con sede en los Pa\u00edses Bajos centrada en el desarrollo de la primera infancia, lanz\u00f3 su iniciativa Urban95 en 2016, enfocada en las perspectivas de los ni\u00f1os en la planificaci\u00f3n urbana. Ciudades de todo el mundo, desde Vancouver a Barcelona, Tirana y Boa Vista (Brasil), han adoptado elementos favorables a la infancia, y algunas, como Rotterdam, han cambiado profundamente como resultado del cambio de perspectiva.</p><p>En <url normalizedValue=\"https://globaldesigningcities.org/publication/designing-streets-for-kids-es/\">Shenzhen</url>, en el sur de China, se pidi\u00f3 a menores de 18 a\u00f1os que participaran en el redise\u00f1o de un parque local, sin permitir a los padres ofrecer orientaci\u00f3n u opiniones, utilizando diferentes t\u00e9cnicas para ni\u00f1os de distintas edades. Por ejemplo, a los menores de seis a\u00f1os se les hizo participar cont\u00e1ndoles cuentos y haci\u00e9ndoles preguntas. En Am\u00e9rica Latina, la <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redocara.com/talleres-esp--oficinas-pt\">Red OCARA</url>, que promueve experiencias y proyectos sobre ciudad, arte, arquitectura y espacio p\u00fablico en los que participan ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as, lanz\u00f3 un \"kit detector de obst\u00e1culos\" para involucrar a los ni\u00f1os en el redise\u00f1o de calles, con talleres de intervenci\u00f3n en espacios p\u00fablicos (por ejemplo, poniendo parches en las calles con baches).</p><p>En la ciudad estadounidense de Boulder (Colorado), una iniciativa lanzada en 2009 consigui\u00f3 que los ni\u00f1os participen directamente en la remodelaci\u00f3n de la ciudad, junto con urbanistas. Ni\u00f1os de tan solo cuatro a\u00f1os participaron en el redise\u00f1o del \u00c1rea C\u00edvica del centro de la ciudad. Los organizadores utilizaron excursiones, construcci\u00f3n de maquetas y cuestionarios con los ni\u00f1os mayores, y con los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os se limitaron a observar sus preferencias. En general, a los ni\u00f1os les gustaba un contacto m\u00e1s directo con la naturaleza: imaginaban una biblioteca en la copa de un \u00e1rbol para leer, rodeados de flores y p\u00e1jaros; imaginaban un puente transparente, donde pudieran pararse y observar el arroyo. Quer\u00edan tener m\u00e1s acceso a aventuras emocionantes, como enormes roc\u00f3dromos desde los que saltar o aterrizar en camas el\u00e1sticas. Y no quer\u00edan ni basura, ni bicicletas a toda velocidad, ni coches.</p><p>Parece bastante elocuente que nos est\u00e1n pidiendo a gritos renaturalizaci\u00f3n, movilidad activa, econom\u00eda circular, socializaci\u00f3n, espacios de arte y juego. De ese modo, se beneficiar\u00e1 nuestra salud y nos beneficiaremos todos -el comercio local incluido-.</p><p>Algunas ideas que proponen los ni\u00f1os son demasiado locas, claro: un parque hecho de caramelos, con puentes llenos de ca\u00f1ones que lanzan chorros de agua a los que van en kayak. El problema es que los adultos podemos ser igual de irracionales cuando se nos consulta sobre urbanismo, dice Mara Mintzer, directora y cofundadora de la iniciativa de Boulder, y no todas las sugerencias tienen por qu\u00e9 llegar al proyecto final. \"No podemos ni debemos esperar que los ni\u00f1os nos den todas las respuestas, ese es nuestro trabajo. No es f\u00e1cil hacerlo bien, con demasiada frecuencia el resultado es simb\u00f3lico o decorativo\", como dijo Gill.</p><p>No deber\u00edamos darnos palmaditas en la espalda cuando incluimos a los ni\u00f1os en la toma de decisiones como si fuera un gran logro. Simplemente deber\u00edamos incluirlos, del mismo modo que a todos los dem\u00e1s. Porque solo la gobernanza verdaderamente inclusiva tiene la llave del futuro, y la diversidad de la creatividad que nos llevar\u00e1 hasta su puerta.

Tambi\u00e9n quiero destacar que ser\u00e1 una oportunidad para que todos podamos hacer llamados inequ\u00edvocos a (...) la equidad en la distribuci\u00f3n de vacunas, a las medidas para mitigar los efectos de la pandemia y por supuesto tambi\u00e9n a la reactivaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica sostenible. </p><p>P: \u00bfCree que en esta cumbre se puede vertebrar alguna estrategia en materia de vacunaci\u00f3n? </p><p>R: Ciertamente vemos que en el mundo hoy hay una distribuci\u00f3n inequitativa. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 se ha presentado esto? Por las mismas din\u00e1micas en las que hemos visto que hay pa\u00edses que han comprado cuatro, cinco, seis, siete veces su poblaci\u00f3n en vacunas, eso por supuesto genera distorsiones. </p><p>Adicionalmente vemos que hay todav\u00eda complejidades log\u00edsticas que hay que superar y tenemos que garantizar que la distribuci\u00f3n sea equitativa en todo el mundo sobre la base muy clara de que nadie est\u00e1 a salvo hasta que todos estemos a salvo. </p><p>Eso implica que la estrategia multilateral Covax tiene que fortalecerse, tenemos que hacer todos m\u00e1s para que sea una entidad cada vez m\u00e1s din\u00e1mica. Colombia copreside la iniciativa Covax en su consejo directivo y me parece que hay que llevar a la Cumbre un mensaje: que hay pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Latina, de Iberoam\u00e9rica, que est\u00e1n rezagados y que necesitamos tambi\u00e9n garantizarles el acceso (a las vacunas). </p><p>P: En el caso particular de Colombia, \u00bfse alcanzar\u00e1 el objetivo de vacunaci\u00f3n fijado para este a\u00f1o? </p><p>R: Nuestra meta es llegar a 35 millones de colombianos (vacunados) este a\u00f1o. Nosotros hemos siempre ido adelante en nuestras propias metas, dijimos que \u00edbamos a empezar el plan de vacunaci\u00f3n el 20 de febrero, lo empezamos el d\u00eda 17 de febrero; logramos el primer mill\u00f3n antes del d\u00eda 30; logramos despu\u00e9s el segundo mill\u00f3n de manera acelerada; el tercer mill\u00f3n en 10 d\u00edas, y nos estamos acercando tambi\u00e9n ahora al cuarto mill\u00f3n de vacunados. </p><p>P: \u00bfLa inequidad en la distribuci\u00f3n de vacunas y los problemas de suministro de algunos laboratorios pueden afectar ese plan? </p><p>R: Esas siempre han sido variables y eso le pasa a cualquier pa\u00eds del mundo. Los pa\u00edses que son compradores de vacunas siempre est\u00e1n sujetos al cumplimiento de las condiciones log\u00edsticas, pero nosotros hemos ido cumpliendo nuestro plan porque adem\u00e1s hemos diversificado la compra, porque hemos tenido la aplicaci\u00f3n responsable de vacunas, porque hemos tenido presencia en todo el territorio nacional y vamos tras la meta de los 35 millones de colombianos vacunados en el a\u00f1o 2021. </p><p>P: Su gobierno ha puesto \u00e9nfasis en la reactivaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica a\u00fan durante la pandemia, \u00bfllevar\u00e1 alg\u00fan planteamiento en ese sentido a la Cumbre Iberoamericana? </p><p>R: Creo que es muy importante que todos tengamos acceso al financiamiento. El Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) alertaba el pasado primero de abril que la relaci\u00f3n de deuda sobre el PIB promedio mundial va a terminar el a\u00f1o 2021 alrededor del 99 %, eso es un reto enorme y trae consigo que en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os los pa\u00edses van a estar compitiendo para acceder a recursos para financiar sus d\u00e9ficit, para financiar su reactivaci\u00f3n, por eso lo m\u00e1s importante para mantener la credibilidad de los mercados es que nosotros podamos proteger a los m\u00e1s vulnerables y al mismo tiempo estabilizar las finanzas p\u00fablicas. </p><p>Pero tenemos que enviar tambi\u00e9n un mensaje muy claro hacia las calificadoras internacionales (de riesgo) de que los pa\u00edses emergentes tienen que ser vistos no con los lentes precovid sino en escenarios donde el mundo se est\u00e1 recuperando de la peor crisis despu\u00e9s de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. </p><p>P: Esta semana, despu\u00e9s de la Cumbre Iberoamericana, usted va a participar en la cumbre de 40 l\u00edderes mundiales contra el cambio clim\u00e1tico convocada por el presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden. \u00bfCu\u00e1les ser\u00e1n sus propuestas en esa reuni\u00f3n? </p><p>R: Colombia, a\u00fan representando tan solo el 0,6 % de las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero, es uno de los 20 pa\u00edses m\u00e1s expuestos a los efectos del cambio clim\u00e1tico y nosotros vamos a llegar a esa cumbre con tres mensajes: Primero, Colombia va a ir a Glasgow, a la Cumbre Clim\u00e1tica (del 1 al 12 de noviembre), con una meta que para el a\u00f1o 2030 haya reducido en 51 % sus emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. </p><p>La segunda, Colombia va a ratificar el mensaje de que llegaremos al a\u00f1o 2050 con el objetivo y el prop\u00f3sito de ser un pa\u00eds de carbono neutral. </p><p>Y el tercer mensaje es la combinaci\u00f3n de dos pol\u00edticas: las soluciones basadas en naturaleza, lo que en ingl\u00e9s se conoce como \"Nature Based Solutions\", que implican reforestaci\u00f3n, protecci\u00f3n de nuestra Amazonia, una cultura para reducir las emisiones individuales de gases de efecto invernadero y la otra es Colombia como l\u00edder en la transici\u00f3n energ\u00e9tica, un pa\u00eds que va a pasar del 0,5 % de su matriz en energ\u00edas renovables no convencionales al 14 % durante nuestro Gobierno y dejando una hoja de ruta para tener un aumento de un 20 % adicional en la pr\u00f3xima d\u00e9cada. </p><p>Con esos prop\u00f3sitos el mensaje es: si un pa\u00eds como Colombia tiene esta convicci\u00f3n y esos objetivos, lo deben tener tambi\u00e9n las econom\u00edas m\u00e1s desarrolladas. </p><p>P: En febrero usted anunci\u00f3 el Estatuto de Protecci\u00f3n Temporal para los migrantes venezolanos. \u00bfLa comunidad internacional est\u00e1 contribuyendo lo suficiente para enfrentar esas crisis? </p><p>R: Nosotros anunciamos la regularizaci\u00f3n de 2,8 millones de migrantes y yo espero para el mes de diciembre o inicios de enero de 2022 tener los primeros 900.000 migrantes con su tarjeta del Estatuto de Protecci\u00f3n Temporal con reconocimiento biom\u00e9trico, y en agosto del a\u00f1o entrante 1,8 millones. </p><p>Sabemos que es muy exigente cumplir esta meta pero estamos contando con el respaldo de la OIM (Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional para las Migraciones), tambi\u00e9n de ACNUR (Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados) y hemos recibido adem\u00e1s mensajes muy claros de ellos de apoyarnos con recursos en este prop\u00f3sito. </p><p>Pero tambi\u00e9n hemos recibido mensajes por ejemplo de la canciller del Gobierno espa\u00f1ol, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, que nos ha dicho: 'Queremos nosotros seguir financiando', Estados Unidos ha dicho que quiere entrar y lo que nosotros queremos tambi\u00e9n es hacer un llamado entre varios pa\u00edses para que esta medida pueda extenderse. </p><p>De hecho, el presidente electo de Ecuador (Guillermo Lasso) ha dicho que quiere seguir una pauta similar y el mensaje a la comunidad internacional es que ya es momento de pasar de las declaraciones a los desembolsos y a los hechos. </p><p>Esta, que es la crisis migratoria m\u00e1s grande del mundo, est\u00e1 significativamente muy por debajo de los aportes de la comunidad donante para el caso de la crisis siria o el de la crisis de Sud\u00e1n. </p><p>P: \u00bfLlevar\u00e1 el tema de la migraci\u00f3n venezolana a la Cumbre Iberoamericana? </p><p>R: Yo voy a hacer referencia a ese tema. Nosotros no podemos tener una Cumbre Iberoamericana y no tocar los temas m\u00e1s sensibles que tenemos en nuestra regi\u00f3n. Si nuestra regi\u00f3n tiene la crisis migratoria m\u00e1s grande del mundo, con m\u00e1s raz\u00f3n tenemos que mostrar los mecanismos para abordarla, no solamente para atender a los migrantes que todos los d\u00edas huyen de la ignominia de la dictadura, sino tambi\u00e9n dejar un mensaje claro: que el camino que se espera en Venezuela es el retorno a la democracia. </p><p>P: \u00bfHay alguna posibilidad de acercamiento con el r\u00e9gimen de Nicol\u00e1s Maduro aunque sea por asuntos humanitarios relacionados con los migrantes? </p><p>R: Tenemos que partir de una base, en Venezuela lo que hay es un r\u00e9gimen ileg\u00edtimo y adem\u00e1s narcodictador y criminal (...) Entonces hay que tener mucho cuidado, porque cuando uno se acerca a los dictadores, lo \u00fanico que termina es validando su poder opresor. </p><p>Los que somos dem\u00f3cratas y defensores de la Carta Democr\u00e1tica Interamericana no podemos tener relaciones d\u00e9biles con quienes quieren pisotear las instituciones democr\u00e1ticas, por eso nosotros seguimos ayud\u00e1ndole al pueblo venezolano con hermandad y seguimos tambi\u00e9n acompa\u00f1ando la resistencia democr\u00e1tica y acompa\u00f1ando a la Asamblea (Nacional) y al presidente (interino Juan) Guaid\u00f3.

Para el a\u00f1o 2050 otros 2.500 millones se trasladar\u00e1n a estas zonas en una espiral de crecimiento urbano que incrementar\u00e1 la vulnerabilidad de dichos territorios a los efectos del cambio clim\u00e1tico. Los c\u00e1lculos recientes del World Watch Institute (2016) nos aportan una realidad en r\u00e1pido cambio de 2 megaciudades en 1950, 29 en 2016, y 41, con m\u00e1s de 10 millones de habitantes, en el a\u00f1o 2030. Los episodios clim\u00e1ticos extremos, como lluvias torrenciales, fuertes temporales e incendios forestales, se prev\u00e9n cada vez m\u00e1s frecuentes y afectar\u00e1n de manera importante a los habitantes de las \u00e1reas marginales de estas grandes urbes. El crecimiento urbano de Nueva York, El Cairo, Tokio, Pek\u00edn, Osaka, Karachi, Calcuta, Sao Paulo, M\u00e9xico o Estambul demuestra claramente esta tendencia que destaca, de manera m\u00e1s clara, en el continente asi\u00e1tico. Esas ciudades se enfrentan, hoy, a la escasez de metales, minerales y combustibles, as\u00ed como a los impactos en los sistemas de alimentaci\u00f3n, transporte y edificaci\u00f3n. El 70% del consumo de energ\u00eda y el 75% de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero (GEH) se produce en estos grandes ecosistemas urbanos que contribuyen por tanto, de manera principal, al cambio clim\u00e1tico.</p><p>Es fundamental, pues, establecer una estrategia de avance hacia un modelo de ciudades sostenibles y resilientes. Si aceptamos la definici\u00f3n de resiliencia como la capacidad de afrontar y superar la adversidad, as\u00ed como, de mejorar la capacidad para afrontar nuevos retos, debemos aceptar, tambi\u00e9n, que las ciudades deben ganar en resiliencia y que la sostenibilidad es un instrumento para ello. El cuidado del medio rural, la creaci\u00f3n de oportunidades de desarrollo y la protecci\u00f3n de los espacios naturales, tan importante en tierras extreme\u00f1as, reducir\u00e1 la presi\u00f3n sobre las ciudades limitando el \u00e9xodo de la poblaci\u00f3n hacia las mismas.</p><p>Gary Gardner, director de publicaciones del World Watch Institute, plantea que una de las formas m\u00e1s directas de poner freno a la expansi\u00f3n es simplemente decir: \u00ab\u00c9ste es el l\u00edmite de nuestra ciudad y no vamos a expandirnos m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de \u00e9l\u00bb. Adem\u00e1s, en el informe anual del WWI 2016, resume en siete las claves para conseguir una ciudad sostenible y m\u00e1s resiliente: Reducir, hacer circulares, y no contaminantes los flujos de materiales; otorgar espacio a la naturaleza mediante infraestructuras verdes y soluciones basadas en la naturaleza (Nature Based Solutions); planificar un desarrollo compacto y conectado; construir lugar (placemaking) creativo generando sentimiento de pertenencia para sus habitantes; fortalecer las ciudades como centros de bienestar, saludables y de acceso a los recursos para toda la poblaci\u00f3n; mantener a las personas en el centro del desarrollo y asegurar una gobernanza participativa compartiendo el poder y consultando a la ciudadan\u00eda en los principales procesos de decisi\u00f3n.</p><p>Pero, adem\u00e1s de la resiliencia, las ciudades necesitar\u00e1n mucha empat\u00eda para abordar el reto de la adaptaci\u00f3n al cambio clim\u00e1tico. Frans de Waal, et\u00f3logo y una de las personas m\u00e1s influyentes del mundo, defiende que el altruismo y la empat\u00eda son algunos de los rasgos que nos hacen humanos y que compartimos con algunos animales, en particular, con nuestros parientes pr\u00f3ximos los primates. Es necesario que esos dos rasgos nos permitan alejarnos de los riesgos del darwinismo social o de la m\u00e1xima que solo sobrevivir\u00e1n los m\u00e1s aptos.</p><p>Cuando los expertos se\u00f1alan que \u00ablas ciudades son centros de pobreza\u00bb, (aproximadamente 1 de cada 7 habitantes de zonas urbanas vive en la pobreza, generalmente, en asentamientos marginales de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo), que alrededor del 10% de la poblaci\u00f3n urbana de dichos pa\u00edses en desarrollo carece de acceso a la electricidad o que el 18% contin\u00faa utilizando la  madera, el esti\u00e9rcol o el carb\u00f3n para cocinar, las ciudades resilientes deber\u00e1n liderar el desarrollo sostenible y el fortalecimiento de las sociedades urbanas bas\u00e1ndose en la empat\u00eda entre sus habitantes.
