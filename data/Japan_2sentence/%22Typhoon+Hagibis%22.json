According to news reporting out of Ibaraki, Japan, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"This study investigates how urban decline and intensifying flood hazards interact to threaten Japan's urban environments, focusing on three main dimensions. First, a fine-scale analysis of spatial shrinkage was conducted using transition potential maps generated with a maximum entropy classifier.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Environmental Research And Technology Development Fund of The Environmental Restoration And Conservation Agency of Japan. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Ibaraki University: \"This approach enabled the identification of neighborhoods at high risk of future abandonment, revealing that peripheral districts, such as Hirakue-cho and Shimoirino-cho, are especially susceptible due to their distance from central amenities. Second, this study analyzed the 2019 Naka River flood induced by Typhoon Hagibis, evaluating water detection performance through both a U-Net-based deep learning model applied to Sentinel-1 SAR imagery in ArcGIS Pro and the DioVISTA Flood Simulator. While the SAR-based approach excelled in achieving high accuracy with a score of 0.81, the simulation-based method demonstrated higher sensitivity, emphasizing its effectiveness in flagging potential flood zones. Third, forward-looking scenarios under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 climate trajectories were modeled to capture the potential scope of future flood impacts. The primary signal is that flooding impacts 3.2 km<sup>2</sup> of buildings and leaves 11 of 82 evacuation sites vulnerable in the worst-case scenario. Japan's proven disaster expertise can still jolt adaptation toward greater flexibility.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Adaptive frameworks utilizing real-time and predictive insights powered by remote sensing, GIS, and machine intelligence form the core of proactive decision-making. By prioritizing the repositioning of decaying suburbs as disaster prevention hubs, steadily advancing hard and soft measures to deployment, supported by the reliability of DioVISTA as a flood simulator, and fueling participatory, citizen-led ties within a community, resilience shifts from a reactive shield to a living ecosystem, aiming for zero victims.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Japan's Urban-Environmental Exposures: A Tripartite Analysis of City Shrinkage, SAR-Based Deep Learning Versus Forward Modeling in Inundation Mapping, and Future Flood Schemes.

It takes in water about seven times a year on average and it has never yet filled to capacity, he said.</p><p> Miyazaki, however, was quick to dispel the notion that the facility protects Tokyo entirely, saying it only directly safeguards three of Tokyo's 23 wards and parts of nearby Saitama Prefecture.</p><p> Managing water has long been a necessity for Japan, where communities and livelihoods began to thrive after paddy farming was introduced during the Yayoi Period more than 1,700 to 2,300 years ago.</p><p> Water management began to be undertaken on a larger scale in the Edo Period (1603-1868) when Japanese warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu established the government in Edo, the metropolis now known as Tokyo.</p><p> Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, deputy director general of the Japan Riverfront Research Center, said over the years Tokyo has weathered flooding incidents such as a fatal downpour in 1910 that cut Japan's gross domestic product by 4.3 percent, and Typhoon Kathleen in 1947.</p><p> According to government data, the flood damage caused by Typhoon Kathleen would amount to 34 trillion yen when adjusted to present-day values.</p><p> Tsuchiya, who worked for the flood-prone Edogawa Ward in Tokyo, cited, for example, a survey from a Swiss-based insurance firm in 2014 and another one in 2002 from a German reinsurance firm naming Tokyo and nearby Yokohama as among the world's most at-risk metropolitan areas.</p><p> Over the years, the public and private sectors in Tokyo and elsewhere in the country have implemented a host of measures, from building flood control-related infrastructure, including reservoirs, dams, dikes, and superlevees, to introducing water-resilient housing and educating residents about disaster preparedness.</p><p> In Kita Ward, the old red Iwabuchi sluice gate is a reminder of past efforts by Tokyo to help prevent flooding of the Sumida River, while a new blue version has replaced it. Discharge channels, though differing in design to the Kasukabe cistern, also exist in Osaka Prefecture and other areas.</p><p> But in recent years, Tokyo increasingly faces risks posed by climate change, Tsuchiya said, pointing to the challenges of the sudden, heavy downpours, known in Japan as \"guerrilla rain.\"</p><p> Data from the Japan Meteorological Agency showed that the average annual heavy rainfall measuring 50 millimeters per hour or more for the 10 years from 2015 to 2024 has increased by about 1.5 times as compared to the decade starting in 1976, the first decade for which data is available.</p><p> While the agency says the metropolitan area can withstand rainfall rates of 50 mm per hour, Tsuchiya pointed out that the hourly precipitation level in Japan, hit by typhoons seasonally, now sometimes reaches up to 100 mm.</p><p> Most recently, Typhoon Hagibis wreaked havoc on seven prefectures and disrupted the Rugby World Cup in 2019, although Tokyo escaped its wrath.</p><p> A key flood-regulating mechanism closer to central Tokyo is the Kanda River Ring Road No. 7 Underground Regulating Reservoir facility.</p><p> The 4.5-km-long tunnel is being expanded to link channels for overflow from Shirako and Kanda rivers and carry floodwaters into Tokyo Bay by fiscal 2027.</p><p> The Tokyo metropolitan government has drawn up a roadmap to make the capital, home to around 14 million people, resilient to various major risks -- storms and floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, pandemics, and power shortages, as well as communications failure.</p><p> While Kasukabe's hidden water infrastructure continues to do the job of keeping Tokyo and its vicinity from being inundated, disaster management experts say the facility alone is not enough for sustainable river management.</p><p> Tsuchiya stressed the need to balance disaster management with future-focused measures, such as encouraging real estate operators to build raised houses, and cited the \"room for river\" concept introduced in Europe.</p><p> \"Flooding does not happen just anywhere. It always occurs at the same places, so we can prepare for it,\" Tsuchiya said, labeling water disasters as largely \"man-made.\"</p><p> \"Water management is not only about managing water at one time but it is about how to take care of water so that 100 years or more from now, we can have a prosperous future,\" he said.</p><p>==Kyodo</p>", "publisher": "Japan Economic Newswire", "instances": ["5 times as compared to the decade starting in 1976, the first decade for which data is available.

The van 't Hoff equation was not well followed for a forested river, where the suspended solids mainly comprised organic matter, suggesting that the dominant process determining dissolved Cs concentrations in forested rivers is not only water temperature effect on ion exchange, but rather the input of Cs and K (competing with Cs for exchange sites on mineral particles) into the water phase via litter leaching.

According to news reporting from Fukushima, Japan, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"This study elucidated the impacts of typhoon events and remediation works on the spatiotemporal evolution of the air dose rate in riverside areas frequented by residents. Spatial distribution of the air dose rate and radiocesium concentration in the sediments were measured in two riverside parks located near each other in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, for 2015-2020.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Fukushima University. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Fukushima Prefectural Centre for Environmental Creation, \"The air dose rates measured by walk surveys were interpolated using ordinary kriging to generate air dose rate maps, to facilitate a comparison between the results at different points in time during the measurement campaigns. After the typhoons that occurred during 2015-2018, the air dose rate near the riverside in one park decreased, but not in the other, because the erosion and sediment deposition patterns differed between them. This could be due to the presence of a dam upstream, which serves a flood mitigation function. However, the extreme event of typhoon Hagibis in 2019 dropped the air dose rates near the riversides in both parks. In contrast to the typhoon events which affected the riverside areas, remediation works such as decontamination undertaken during 2015-2019 reduced the air dose rates around the garden and lawn areas which are frequently used as recreational sites. Modeling the temporal evolutions in the air dose rates for the entire area of the riverside parks revealed that 35% of the reduction was caused by physical decay of radiocesium on average, 14% by vertical migration of radiocesium in the soil through precipitation, and 51% by the three typhoons and remediation works during 2015-2019.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The contribution of 20% from the strongest typhoon Hagibis highlights the fact that floods resulting from large typhoons are effective in causing natural attenuation of air dose rates in riverside parks.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Impact evaluation of typhoons and remediation works on spatiotemporal evolution of air dose rate in two riverside parks in Fukushima, Japan after the Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident.

Bickle: I'm currently the president of the British Chamber of Commerce in Japan (BCCJ). In total, this will be my 22nd year in Japan, and I've been based here on two occasions. My first time was after graduating from university, when I joined Kobe Steel, where I had a chance to play with the Kobe Steel rugby team for six years from 1993 to 1999. I was very fortunate that in 1996, I was also selected to play for the Japan national team, and in that year I played six times for Japan.</p><p>Assessment of Rugby World Cup 2019 JS: How do you assess the Rugby World Cup 2019 in Japan overall? Everybody speaks about it as a great success. Bickle: I think however you measure it, it's been a huge success, both in terms of the experience the fans have had and the quality of the rugby. It was historic that Japan won all of their group matches and were able to make it through to the last eight, their first time in history to reach the knockout tournament. If you look at the metrics, the television audience for all of Japan's games was incredible. I think the record top five viewing figures for television audiences of rugby matches are now all involving the Japan team, with nearly 55 million people in Japan tuning in to watch them play Scotland. More than 400,000 foreign visitors arrived in Japan to watch the tournament in person, and I think there were more than 1 million visits to the official fan zones. On social media, according to figures published by World Rugby, there were 1.7 billion views of videos and content, so the social media engagement was incredible - at unsurpassed levels.</p><p>And I think the economic impact was huge as well - World Rugby estimates it to be 437 billion yen. Importantly, beyond the economic impact was the engagement of people in Japan and the development of the game, and the number of children in Japan who for the first time were introduced to rugby - not just through the tournament but with the community engagement exercises that took place around the tournament.</p><p>The impact has been huge. That was during the tournament and before the tournament, but I think we all hope now that as a legacy of the tournament we'll see continued engagement, impact, and follow through. JS: I recently came across the term 'sports hospitality' for the first time. What are your thoughts on sports hospitality, and about that aspect of the legacy here? Bickle: I think sports hospitality is clearly a new opportunity for Japan. Particularly around the World Cup, it was the same company which delivered hospitality at the last three or four Rugby World Cups.</p><p>They had a bespoke facility built in Yokohama, and the professionalism of the delivery really created a focus around corporate hospitality, a chance for companies and organizations to bring guests to a quality facility and enjoy themselves and network before and after a game. It's another way for companies and organizations to entertain their clients and guests in a very exclusive, unusual, and unique networking environment.</p><p>There is a huge multiplier effect as well for the economy, so anything to do with the delivery of services - food, drink, entertainment - has a positive impact on the economy here. If you look at sports hospitality in the United Kingdom, a lot of it is focused around the stadiums.</p><p>A number of those are used not just on match day, but also throughout the year for conferences and entertainment. I think that's another angle to look at - whether sports hospitality offers a way to get better utilization of the infrastructure that there is already here in Japan. JS: Travel agents and the hospitality industry in Japan seem to be looking forward to more tourists from all over the world. Bickle: I think so, and tourists are increasingly looking for an experiential time, for experiences rather than just things. Certainly, around an event like the Rugby World Cup, I think being able to package a match ticket and travel to the game within a hospitality package makes it a more appealing offering to tourists. British Chamber of Commerce's Involvement JS: Would you please tell us a bit more about the British Chamber of Commerce's involvement in supporting the Rugby World Cup? Bickle: Certainly. One thing we realized a couple of years ago was that the Rugby World Cup 2019 Organising Committee was very keen to speak to the foreign business community with one voice, so what the BCCJ did was to get together with seven other foreign chambers of commerce to form the Rugby Alliance.</p><p>The original mission of the Rugby Alliance was two-fold: it was to support the delivery of a 2019 Rugby World Cup that all stakeholders here in Japan can be proud of, and secondly to foster a legacy that features more inclusive communities which embrace opportunities for international business and exchange. Working together with the other chambers of commerce, we collaborated closely with the organizing committee.</p><p>The BCCJ also hosted a think tank event in July on responsible tourism, where we had representatives from some of the regional economies in Japan, and people from the tourism, hospitality, and hotel industries. We talked about opportunities for tourism here, including those connected with the Rugby World Cup.</p><p>And about some of the challenges Japan is facing. Particularly where the hospitality industry is rapidly scaling up and also the number of visitors is rapidly increasing, and the challenges of being able to cater to those visitors. Not just to cater to them, but to cater to them in a sustainable way. JS: Do you think Japan will be successful in keeping these great numbers of tourists, just like China was successful in having done so after the Beijing Olympics? Bickle: I think so. What the Rugby World Cup has done is to open up the whole of Japan to a new audience. Tourism from Europe and the United States has traditionally been focused on the large metropolitan and cultural centres - Tokyo going down to Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Hiroshima, and places like that - but the Rugby World Cup has been nationwide, from Sapporo in the north in Hokkaido down to Kyushu in the west. That's given overseas tourists a chance to see what Japan has to offer. I think a number of tourists still have the image of Japan being a highly urbanized country, and they are pleasantly surprised when they see that much of the country is beautiful mountains and forests as well.</p><p>The key will be finding ways to enable foreign tourists to discover the rest of Japan. I think that is where the Rugby World Cup was so powerful, as a catalyst to get people to move beyond the traditional tourism centres to places where perhaps, were it not for the rugby, they would not have seen.</p><p>The Japanese National Team JS: As a former lock, what is your opinion of the Japanese national team? Bickle: The Japanese national team has been absolutely tremendous in this tournament.</p><p>They played a brand of rugby which has thrilled the world. Everyone has been amazed, I think, about the way Japan played in this tournament. What we saw was a new level of skill and accuracy. Japan has moved on and improved to another level, and their skill and accuracy have enabled them to move on to play a very attractive brand of running rugby.</p><p>The statistics bear this out, with 55 million people watching them on TV against Scotland. Most of the games were played in front of capacity crowds. We saw people who have never had an interest in rugby as a sport being excited and enthused to follow the national team during this tournament. I think that's because Japan's skill level has improved markedly, together with their competitiveness in all facets of the game.</p><p>At the end of a couple of their matches, after 70 or 80 minutes when the players would have been exhausted, their forwards still had the reserves of strength, desire, conditioning, and also the skills, to challenge and win crucial penalties at the scrum.</p><p>Another Aspect of the Legacy of Rugby JS: Going back to the question of the legacy of rugby, the sport has become very popular in Japan now thanks to this World Cup. How can we maintain the popularity of rugby? Bickle: It's going to be a challenge, because when you host a tournament there is going to be interest before and during the tournament because of the media coverage.</p><p>There have been a lot of initiatives around the tournament, for example the Impact Beyond initiative, where there have been outreaches to schools. Hundreds of schools have been introduced to tag rugby, providing thousands of schoolchildren with access to try these sports. Seven-a-side rugby is an Olympic sport, obviously a different game from the 15-a-side code that we saw in the World Cup, but that's another very high-profile event and I think it's important to try and link the two, to maintain the momentum. Beyond the Summer Olympics, we've got the Paralympics as well, where wheelchair rugby will be a very key sport. We're also seeing some of the regions in Japan looking to promote themselves through rugby as well. One place is Kitakyushu, which hosted Wales during this World Cup, and is also working very closely with Team GB, the Great Britain Paralympics team.</p><p>They'll be hosting the Great Britain wheelchair rugby squad in Kitakyushu before the Paralympics. So first of all, I think it's about linking rugby - in its various forms - to these mega sporting events, and secondly it's about creating opportunities for youngsters to continue to enjoy the game. It's going to be key as well to find ways to involve the Japan national team into better quality competition. It's important to give fans the opportunity to see top-quality competition here in Japan and ensure that they stay enthused. JS: I'm interested in what you said about local-to-local cooperation, such as Kitakyushu and Wales. Do you think that kind of cooperation will grow? Bickle: I think so. It's a win-win process for both sides.</p><p>A number of rugby unions worked very hard in the build-up to the Rugby World Cup, years in advance with the towns and the cities where the teams were going to be based, and they've been running rugby programs to promote interest in the sport, but also interest in their own country. We've seen the great work being done in Kitakyushu, and I think there's been tremendous work done up in Kamaishi too with the new stadium being built there.</p><p>They hosted one game during the tournament but unfortunately because of the terrible Typhoon Hagibis, the second game was cancelled. But you saw the Canadian team working with the amazing local community afterwards in the clean-up.</p><p>They were building relationships there, and hopefully these relationships will continue to endure over the years to come. JS: Do you think Japanese schools should have classes on rugby? Bickle: I would certainly love to see Japanese schools have classes on rugby, because the values of integrity, respect, solidarity, passion, and discipline are displayed. I think the 'fun' aspect of it is also hugely important. People ask why countries like New Zealand produce so many fabulous players. I think it's because kids from a very young age pick up a rugby ball and are just playing, they're throwing the ball around, and through doing that they are developing the awareness of the game, spatial awareness, subconscious things which are the key to decision-making.</p><p>These are things that develop over time and cannot necessarily be coached, so I think it's about giving kids in Japan the opportunity to enjoy the game. JS: Some have said that leadership might also be a good thing to be developed through rugby. What do you think? Bickle: I agree, because if you look on the rugby field, there are many leaders. Someone is obviously designated the captain, but you see a lot of communication.</p><p>There are people in a number of positions who have senior roles, and it's not just the captain. I think rugby and all team sports are a chance for an individual to develop leadership skills. You don't have to be labelled as the leader to show leadership, and I think kids can learn that through sport.</p><p>They don't have to be loud and vocal, they can learn and show leadership by demonstrating their commitment, their drive and determination that all of their teammates can see, so that's leading by example. Leadership is beyond just being the captain; actually showing leadership is much, much broader - showing your commitment to the team and learning how to inspire and motivate other people as well. What We Can Expect from the Tokyo Games JS: OK, let's move on to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. That will be another opportunity to promote sports and have people visit the host country. What do you expect? Bickle: The Summer Olympics and Paralympics is a huge opportunity for Japan, as a catalyst and a magnet for foreign tourists.</p><p>The Olympics itself is a shorter tournament and geographically is broadly limited to the Tokyo area, but I think it's still a tremendous opportunity to promote the country and to bring in tourists. Hopefully, Japan and Japanese regions will build on what they've done for the Rugby World Cup, and will continue to market themselves and appeal to the tourists who come specifically to watch the Games. I sincerely hope as well that beyond the Summer Olympics, we're going to see a fantastic Paralympic Games here in Japan, certainly in terms of the legacy after London 2012. That's one of the things the London organizers are very proud of, the success of the Paralympic Games. I hope that we see that here in Japan as well, with fans wanting to come to soak up the atmosphere and see the very high quality of competition that there is around Para sports as well. JS: You said something interesting about the Rugby World Cup, that athletes, coaches, and tourists stay longer, because rugby is a very exhausting game, so you need about a week between matches, and that will prolong your stay in the country. In the case of the Olympics, will the time be too short to attract a lot of attention to the Games and also to the country? Bickle: Obviously the period of the Games is much shorter, but I think there are opportunities for Japan to market itself and appeal in advance to foreign tourists who are coming to the Games to come early, in advance of the Games, or to stay on afterwards and explore the rest of the country. Japan is blessed with a remarkably efficient and extensive transportation network. It's safe and it's easy to get around to all parts of the country, and I think more and more foreigners are waking up to that realization and understanding that there is much, much more to see in Japan. But in order for Japan to maximize the opportunity, and for the regions to maximize the opportunity, they will have to actively market themselves and get creative as well. I think tourism is a great potential source of economic benefit for local regions, and can really be a source of economic vitality for the residents of those areas. Once again, hopefully it's a win-win situation. I think that the way Japan will be able to maximize the opportunity that tourism has to offer for the Japanese economy and the Japanese people is to ensure that it is spread throughout the country. In that way, hopefully, all the regions can benefit by participating in this tourism boom. British Chamber of Commerce's Involvement in the Games JS: I'm curious about your chamber of commerce's involvement in promoting the legacy of the Tokyo Olympics. Bickle: What we will try to do in terms of the legacy is to develop tourism and other opportunities for internationalization.</p><p>There is interest around global sporting events, but that is just one subsector of the tourism industry, one of the offerings. In our event earlier this year based around sustainable tourism, we were looking at what we can do to help the sector. We might be able to share some things from the UK experience, where the UK government has announced comprehensive plans to promote tourism, and then hopefully Japan will be able to refer to those in developing its own best practices.</p><p>The UK is focusing on things like accessibility, making many parts of the UK more accessible for people with mobility issues.</p><p>There is certainly a lot for Japan to work on in that area, and hosting the Paralympics is a great opportunity to shine a light on these issues, to open up Japan to a much bigger pool of visitors. Expected Legacy of the Games JS: Sports is expected to play a key role in maintaining good health among older people, which is very important in an aging society. In terms of your experience or the UK experience, what do you think about this? Bickle: Definitely, I agree.</p><p>As society ages and people's lifespans are getting longer, the key challenge now is to give people high-quality lifestyles as they age. Helping to keep people healthy and active contributes to that.</p><p>There are physical health benefits from regular exercise, so sport has a role to play there. I think an important point too is to enable people to feel fulfilled, so participating in sports activities, going out to watch high-quality sporting events, all these things can help. If such activities can be offered, or made more accessible to the senior members of our society, I think they can contribute to enabling a more stimulating and rewarding life for people in retirement. To create opportunities though, there will need to be additional investment in infrastructure, and also in organization. JS: Sports hospitality, volunteer activities, and similar 'software' are a key legacy of the Olympics and Paralympics. How can Japan further promote those activities? Bickle: I think it's about reinforcing those strengths and successes; in sports, it would be great to see continued involvement and engagement from national team players, also continued support from companies. I think collaboration is the key here.</p><p>There are areas where NGOs can work together in pursuit of their goals. In terms of opportunities to create healthy lifestyles for children, hopefully there's a chance for NGOs to work together with schools, with local authorities, and maybe with their local sports teams, to involve the top-quality sports players in the community, contributing, participating, and helping out. In Japan, we're seeing more investment now in all-weather pitches, and it will be great if we can see more of those. Obviously, the cost is an issue, but hopefully there will be more investment in facilities which will enable children to more actively participate in sport. JS: Perhaps we can take advantage of information technology and other new technologies for networking? Bickle: Certainly.</p><p>These days, with social media and technology, it's much, much easier to collaborate and promote. Many of these organizations have a social media presence to enable them to share their goals and their activities with other people. That's an important aspect of helping to create and maintain these alliances. </p>", "publisher": "Japan SPOTLIGHT", "instances": ["A number of rugby unions worked very hard in the build-up to the Rugby World Cup, years in advance with the towns and the cities where the teams were going to be based, and they've been running rugby programs to promote interest in the sport, but also interest in their own country.
