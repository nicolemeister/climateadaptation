Hence, in this study, we examined soil characteristics and their relationship with maize yield across 196 locations in the Nacala Corridor of northern Mozambique. The results revealed significant variation in soil fertility, which was primarily influenced by organic matter, clay content, and nutrient availability. Cluster analysis identified three distinct soil fertility groups: low-fertility soils were found in the eastern region, with reduced maize yield, whereas high-fertility soils were predominant in the western and centralsouthern regions, which produced better yield. These findings highlight the importance of detailed soil analysis for the development of targeted soil management strategies, such as conservation agriculture and integrated soil fertility management, that can enhance nutrient retention, increase organic matter content, and improve crop yield.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study provides essential insights for smallholder farmers and policymakers to implement sustainable agriculture and improve long-term productivity in northern Mozambique.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Management Strategies for Regenerative Agriculture Based On the Assessment of Soil Fertility In Northern Mozambique.

This study evaluated the involvement of biochar into long-term no-tillage combined with cover crop as a regenerative organic approach on soil health and carbon sequestration as well as to assess the economic viability of this farming system. The field experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with a split-split plot arrangement consisting of different tillage practices (no-tillage, rotary cultivator, and moldboard plowing), cover crop (rye, hairy vetch, and fallow), and biochar applications (with and without biochar), in four replications. The study also included two farming scenarios, soybean and soybean + rice production, for economic analysis. Results showed that incorporating biochar into the continuous no-tillage with cover crop rotation increased soil organic carbon and its stock in the topsoil profile (0-30 cm), improved soil health indicators by reducing soil bulk density and penetration resistance, and increased microbial activity, thereby promoting nutrient cycling. Soybean yield varied under the no-tillage system, resulting in a low benefit-cost ratio; however, the integration of soybean with rice production improved this ratio in organic farming-based no-tillage management.

It has many aspects, including social sustainability and economic sustainability, in addition to environmental sustainability, all of which must be ensured.</p><p> The World Economic Forum has been underscoring the importance of this issue since 1973, when the \"limits to growth\" report was published. Humans cannot continue to exploit nature indefinitely, and economic growth in a way that imposes costs on future generations is unjust and unsustainable.</p><p> However, the risks related to sustainability have been underestimated in past policies related to politics, economics, and society. One reason is the optimism that was embedded in many people during the globalization that followed the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1989 that the world economy could expand indefinitely.</p><p> Policymakers are not always adept at integrating certain risks, like a pandemic, that are highly uncertain and have no great probability of occurring, but if it does occur, it will have serious consequences. The same is true of climate change risks, which have only recently been taken seriously, as many parts of the world are experiencing torrential rain and heat waves.</p><p> Many scientists have pointed out that if the temperature increase since the Industrial Revolution exceeds 1.5 C, the change will exceed a tipping point and become irreversible. Some estimates suggest that if the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is unstoppable, global sea level will rise by 7 meters. Since the average temperature has already risen by 1.2 C, there is little margin left for change, and the coming seven years until 2030 represents a crucial period. Without addressing the underlying issues of climate change, a sustainable society will not be realized.</p><p> Achieving a sustainable future will require transformative changes in the economy and society. But this is a very complex issue, and much must be accomplished to make it happen.</p><p> First, it is important to make economic growth more inclusive, because right now, many people are being left out of the benefits of growth.</p><p> Secondly, it is also important to decouple energy consumption and economic growth, and to decarbonize production processes such as steel and cement, as well as transportation. The key to both of these is the expansion of renewable energy, but much innovation is still needed.</p><p> Decarbonizing the economy is essential, but it is not enough. Nature-based solutions (NbS), which leverage nature to advance solutions to various problems, are fundamentally important. Changing to regenerative agriculture and aquaculture can increase the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by ecosystems.</p><p> This requires reshaping existing infrastructure, which is enormously costly. With many countries unable to afford such investments, I am not all that optimistic that politicians will have the political will for fundamental change and global unity, when global solidarity is most needed.</p><p> But even if it is a cost in the short term, there are many opportunities in the long term for efforts to create a sustainable society, and it will lead to job creation. We are hopeful that companies are beginning to understand this and that consumers are becoming more aware of the importance of choosing products and companies that are serious about greening the economy.</p><p> (Klaus Schwab is a founder, Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum)</p><p>==Kyodo</p>", "publisher": "Japan Economic Newswire", "instances": ["Decarbonizing the economy is essential, but it is not enough.

Leaders have expressed concern that the older generation may be lost to Covid-19, leaving no one to pass on ancestral wisdom to the next generations (Japan Times, Aug. 7, 2020). Moreover, there has been an increase in rubbish directly related to Covid-19, such as piles of used masks and personal protective equipment (PPE), and the waste arising from coffee shops that will no longer let customers bring their own reusable cups, or from pubs selling takeaway beers in plastic cups. To avoid the risk of spreading infection, throw-away, one-use items have often become the norm, such as the two million disposable pens employed for use in the recent New Zealand general election. Confronted with the enormity of global climate change, many tend to give up and go on as usual, or become frozen with despair: succumbing to either panic or paralysis, as Joanna Macy puts it. However, there is another way forward: to see the situation clearly, but nevertheless to have hope and to take actions towards positive ends, regardless of how bad things may look.</p><p>As governments will have to keep fiscally stimulating their economies for many years, this is an opportunity to transition from carbon-powered energy to renewables, which could ease the cost as well, by helping nations to meet their emissions targets while also creating new jobs in fields such as solar and wind generation, batteries, electricity grid improvement, and decarbonization of transport and manufacturing. Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate in economics, says, 'The public has a right to demand that companies receiving help contribute to social and racial justice, improved health and the shift to a greener, more knowledge-based economy' and believes that green investment can be 'timely, labor-intensive, and highly stimulative, moving countries closer to the societies they claim to be.' In the United Kingdom, it will soon become mandatory for large companies and financial institutions to provide climate risk reports, while in 2021 the country's first green gilt will be floated in the financial markets, raising funds for investment in carbon-reducing projects and job creation. Global activist movements such as Extinction Rebellion, Ocean Rebellion, Avaaz, Tree Sisters, Action Station in New Zealand, and numerous other parties have long been pointing the way. Macy urges us to make the shift from the industrial growth model to a lifesustaining civilization, which she dubs the 'Great Turning' - 'the essential adventure of our time'.</p><p>This Great Turning has three dimensions: actions to slow the damage to Earth and its beings, analysis of structural causes and the creation of structural alternatives, and a shift in consciousness. Karenna Gore, founder of the Center for Earth Ethics, sees the illusion of the separation between humans and nature as a core issue. Our current economic model, which is based on endless industrial growth, does not take into account negative effects such as pollution, inequality, and resource depletion, or consider the long-term benefits of environmental measures.</p><p>A fundamental shift is needed, such as that formulated by Kate Raworth in her doughnut economic model, with its detailed plan for transforming degenerative, divisive economies into regenerative, more distributive ones.</p><p>The Dalai Lama says that, since we are all inextricably interconnected with each other and with nature, it is to our own benefit to care for each other and the planet, and sees problems arising when we address new realities with old mindsets. 'Our Mother Earth is teaching us a lesson about universal responsibility.' Some have suggested that there should always be three empty chairs in rooms where major decisions are made, symbolizing the marginalized, all future generations, and all non-human life. Damon Gameau provides many reasons for hope in the film 2040, which extrapolates what the world could be like 20 years from now, even if we make use only of currently existing technology and innovative ideas. In Borneo, Health in Harmony and local NGO Alam Sehat Lestari have achieved a 70% reduction in deforestation by providing easier access to affordable healthcare, after being told by indigenous communities that they worked as loggers to earn enough money for medical treatment. This shows the importance of listening to local voices.</p><p>According to a just-released report by the International Energy Agency, global renewable electricity installation will hit a record level in 2020. Global peace activists have long been calling for a transfer of funds from military goals to more peaceful purposes, which would free up a huge amount of money.</p><p>A Call for Action after Covid-19 by New Zealand Quakers 'calls on every person in Aotearoa New Zealand to bring about whatever changes they can to enable us to live in harmony with one another and with the planet.' Finally, the election of Joe Biden as the next president of the United States has brought renewed hope for climate action, since Biden has promised to rejoin the Paris Agreement, as well as to substantially lower US emissions by investing in low-carbon technology. Moreover, strong US leadership in this area is likely to have a powerful effect on other countries as well. Shift from International Travel to Staycations? At a recent meeting, where participants discussed how we had been affected by Covid-19, I was struck by the reliance of so many of us on the regular use of international flights. Many believe this will have to change - and the pandemic has brought this issue into sharp focus, with clearer skies resulting from far fewer flights. But once we are able to again fly internationally, how many of us will refrain from doing so? Meanwhile, 'staycations' - holidaying at home or at least in the same country - are growing in popularity.</p><p>Airbus plans to develop the world's first hydrogen-based zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035 (The Guardian, Sept. 22, 2020). Through such developments, perhaps it will eventually be possible to travel by plane without causing ecological harm. Environmental Conundrums and Initiatives Some measures are not so clear-cut.</p><p>The environmental effect of building an electric car, for example, might involve more CO2 emissions than a petrol-based car; however, over its entire life cycle the electric car has fewer total emissions.</p><p>A recent study found that, although trees tend to grow faster in warmer climes, they have a shorter lifespan - accordingly, as temperatures increase, forests might grow more quickly, but could store less carbon with the shorter lifespan of the trees.</p><p>And, unexpectedly, in some countries, the pandemic has had a negative effect on attitudes to public transport, with many people now preferring to use their own cars rather than public transport. However, new environmental initiatives with potentially far-reaching beneficial consequences are constantly emerging. One is the 'syntropic farming' developed by Ernst Gotsch, a process-based farming that goes beyond sustainability or regenerative agriculture to actively improve the soil and overall environment and create a positive energy balance. Fairphone makes an ethical smartphone and 'aims to motivate the whole industry to take action on social and environmental issues in the electronics supply chain' through innovative long-lasting design, fair materials, good working conditions and recycling, and encourages people to keep their phones for as long as possible, since 'the most sustainable phone is the one you already have.' 'Green' hydrogen is made entirely from renewable sources and could be used as fuel to supplement solar and wind power, to decarbonize public transport, to provide green fuel for heavy-duty vehicles, and to fly zero-carbon planes. Renewable hydrogen can also be used to produce steel with near-zero emissions. Lithium has recently been found in hot salty springs in Cornwall in the UK, which could be used for electric car batteries. Covid-19 has allowed us to re-think our future, a matter of utmost urgency.

Global activist movements such as Extinction Rebellion, Ocean Rebellion, Avaaz, Tree Sisters, Action Station in New Zealand, and numerous other parties have long been pointing the way.</p><p> Macy urges us to make the shift from the industrial growth model to a lifesustaining civilization, which she dubs the 'Great Turning' - 'the essential adventure of our time'. This Great Turning has three dimensions: actions to slow the damage to Earth and its beings, analysis of structural causes and the creation of structural alternatives, and a shift in consciousness. Karenna Gore, founder of the Center for Earth Ethics, sees the illusion of the separation between humans and nature as a core issue. Our current economic model, which is based on endless industrial growth, does not take into account negative effects such as pollution, inequality, and resource depletion, or consider the long-term benefits of environmental measures.</p><p>A fundamental shift is needed, such as that formulated by Kate Raworth in her doughnut economic model, with its detailed plan for transforming degenerative, divisive economies into regenerative, more distributive ones.</p><p>The Dalai Lama says that, since we are all inextricably interconnected with each other and with nature, it is to our own benefit to care for each other and the planet, and sees problems arising when we address new realities with old mindsets. 'Our Mother Earth is teaching us a lesson about universal responsibility.' Some have suggested that there should always be three empty chairs in rooms where major decisions are made, symbolizing the marginalized, all future generations, and all non-human life. Damon Gameau provides many reasons for hope in the film 2040, which extrapolates what the world could be like 20 years from now, even if we make use only of currently existing technology and innovative ideas. In Borneo, Health in Harmony and local NGO Alam Sehat Lestari have achieved a 70% reduction in deforestation by providing easier access to affordable healthcare, after being told by indigenous communities that they worked as loggers to earn enough money for medical treatment. This shows the importance of listening to local voices.</p><p>According to a just-released report by the International Energy Agency, global renewable electricity installation will hit a record level in 2020. Global peace activists have long been calling for a transfer of funds from military goals to more peaceful purposes, which would free up a huge amount of money.</p><p>A Call for Action after Covid-19 by New Zealand Quakers 'calls on every person in Aotearoa New Zealand to bring about whatever changes they can to enable us to live in harmony with one another and with the planet.' Finally, the election of Joe Biden as the next president of the United States has brought renewed hope for climate action, since Biden has promised to rejoin the Paris Agreement, as well as to substantially lower US emissions by investing in low-carbon technology. Moreover, strong US leadership in this area is likely to have a powerful effect on other countries as well. Shift from International Travel to Staycations? At a recent meeting, where participants discussed how we had been affected by Covid-19, I was struck by the reliance of so many of us on the regular use of international flights. Many believe this will have to change - and the pandemic has brought this issue into sharp focus, with clearer skies resulting from far fewer flights. But once we are able to again fly internationally, how many of us will refrain from doing so? Meanwhile, 'staycations' - holidaying at home or at least in the same country - are growing in popularity.</p><p>Airbus plans to develop the world's first hydrogen-based zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035 (The Guardian, Sept. 22, 2020). Through such developments, perhaps it will eventually be possible to travel by plane without causing ecological harm. Environmental Conundrums and Initiatives Some measures are not so clear-cut.</p><p>The environmental effect of building an electric car, for example, might involve more CO2 emissions than a petrol-based car; however, over its entire life cycle the electric car has fewer total emissions.</p><p>A recent study found that, although trees tend to grow faster in warmer climes, they have a shorter lifespan - accordingly, as temperatures increase, forests might grow more quickly, but could store less carbon with the shorter lifespan of the trees.</p><p>And, unexpectedly, in some countries, the pandemic has had a negative effect on attitudes to public transport, with many people now preferring to use their own cars rather than public transport. However, new environmental initiatives with potentially far-reaching beneficial consequences are constantly emerging. One is the 'syntropic farming' developed by Ernst Gotsch, a process-based farming that goes beyond sustainability or regenerative agriculture to actively improve the soil and overall environment and create a positive energy balance. Fairphone makes an ethical smartphone and 'aims to motivate the whole industry to take action on social and environmental issues in the electronics supply chain' through innovative long-lasting design, fair materials, good working conditions and recycling, and encourages people to keep their phones for as long as possible, since 'the most sustainable phone is the one you already have.' 'Green' hydrogen is made entirely from renewable sources and could be used as fuel to supplement solar and wind power, to decarbonize public transport, to provide green fuel for heavy-duty vehicles, and to fly zero-carbon planes. Renewable hydrogen can also be used to produce steel with near-zero emissions. Lithium has recently been found in hot salty springs in Cornwall in the UK, which could be used for electric car batteries. Covid-19 has allowed us to re-think our future, a matter of utmost urgency. Let us build on our hope and strengths to work together for a greener, fairer world.</p>", "publisher": "Japan SPOTLIGHT", "instances": ["And, unexpectedly, in some countries, the pandemic has had a negative effect on attitudes to public transport, with many people now preferring to use their own cars rather than public transport.
