SPOTLIGHT", "published": "2025-06-04", "bodyText": "<p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, June 4 (Bernama) --\u00a0Unison Technology &amp; Manufacturing (M) PLT is introducing modular hive systems and training initiatives to strengthen stingless bee farming and rural livelihoods in Malaysia\u00a0in line with the country\u20ac\u2122s participation in Expo 2025 Osaka.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;In a statement, the Johor-based company said it has developed patented beehive structures made of concrete composite materials, which are designed to improve hive durability and reduce long-term maintenance.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;Senior lecturer at Azman Hashim International Business School, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)\u00a0and lead innovator at Unison Technology &amp; Manufacturing\u00a0Dr Mohd Khairuddin Ramliy\u00a0said the global decline in bee population threatens biodiversity and food security, as bees are responsible for pollinating about 75 per cent of crops consumed worldwide.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153In response, Unison is reimagining stingless bee farming by developing patented bee modular boxes and concrete composite beehives designed to improve honey yields and simplify hive management.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153By modernising traditional apiculture, Unison is linking ecological restoration with economic opportunity, positioning Malaysia as a sustainability-driven innovator ahead of Expo 2025 Osaka,\u20ac he said.\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durable Design for Native Pollinators&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;Dr Mohd Khairuddin said Unison\u20ac\u2122s hive technology offers durable and secure habitats for stingless bees, a native pollinator species vital to Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s ecosystem.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153The use of concrete composite materials reduces the need for frequent replacement, cutting down environmental waste and increasing the lifespan of each hive,\u20ac he said.\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;He\u00a0added that the innovation supports higher pollination rates for crops, native plants, and fruits, ultimately boosting agricultural yields.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153In line with the United Nations Environment Programme\u20ac\u2122s call for nature-based solutions, Unison\u20ac\u2122s technology directly contributes to climate adaptation, biodiversity protection, and ecosystem resilience.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153Tailored for Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s tropical climate, the hive design demonstrates how engineering and ecology can work hand in hand to support both productivity and environmental sustainability,\u20ac he said.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusive Model for Rural Communities&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;He also said Unison\u20ac\u2122s bee farming model goes beyond ecology by supporting rural livelihoods through training, equipment, and tools that lower entry barriers for aspiring beekeepers.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153The model is intentionally inclusive, providing women, youth, and marginalised groups with opportunities to earn sustainable incomes through honey harvesting and the production of value-added products such as propolis, bee pollen, and beeswax items.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153This diversification supports financial resilience and long-term self-sufficiency while revitalising traditional ecological knowledge and enabling communities to adopt climate-resilient practices that are both economically viable and socially inclusive,\u20ac he said.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability and Technical Support&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;Dr Mohd Khairuddin further said Unison\u20ac\u2122s modular hive system is engineered for ease of use, consistency, and scalability, with a standardised structure that ensures optimal hive conditions, supports bee health, and improves productivity for users ranging from backyard farmers to large-scale producers.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153The company\u20ac\u2122s work is supported by training, technical assistance, and collaboration with agricultural institutions, enabling Unison to refine its products based on real-world feedback and adapt them to various environments and farming needs.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153By offering a reliable and scalable system backed by rigorous product development, Unison is supporting the growth of a structured, high-quality apiculture sector in Malaysia while advancing national goals in food security, biodiversity restoration, and regenerative agriculture,\u20ac he said.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aligned with Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s Sustainability Goals at Expo 2025 Osaka&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u00a0</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;Additionally, he said the company\u20ac\u2122s work aligns with Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s participation in Expo 2025 Osaka, which focuses on designing a future society that balances progress with sustainability.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153Unison\u20ac\u2122s approach demonstrates that pollinator protection is not only an ecological responsibility but also a strategic opportunity to drive prosperity, empower communities, and foster harmony between people and nature.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\" data-start=\"464\"&gt;\u20ac\u0153As Malaysia prepares to present its sustainability vision on the global stage, Unison stands as a proud example of how local innovation can deliver global relevance,\u20ac he said.</p><p>&lt;p data-end=\"678\"

Originally from Sierra Leone, Fatmata Binta was born into the Fulani, the largest nomadic tribe in Africa. After a career in international relations, the young woman decided to devote herself fully to the recognition of her culture. She created Fulani Kitchen, a concept of pop-up restaurants that invite customers to take off their shoes and eat with their fingers to discover the customs of the Fulani people. On the menu are West African ingredients such as millet, dawadawa, egusi, okra and baobab. Fatmata Binta has also launched a foundation in Ghana that gives women the opportunity to own land. They can also grow and sell fonio, a herbaceous plant common in West Africa.</p><p>Rethinking tomorrow's world through cooking The Basque Culinary Centre, which launched this &amp;#8364;100,000 prize, explains that it is envisioning cooking as a means to advance society in areas ranging from social innovation to food education.

reviewing investment incentives to focus on encouraging investments that generate high-income jobs and are sourced locally; and upgrading industrial areas with complete infrastructure and increase human capital development to meet the needs of investors. </p><p>As a start, the government has allocated RM100 million to complete the infrastructure of the industrial area which focuses on the green concept. </p><p>Concurrently, Domestic Direct Investment (DDI) will be set as one of the key performance indicators (KPI) for Malaysia's investment achievements. </p><p>Thirdly is to internationalise local startups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). </p><p>The framework highlighted the need for government-linked companies (GLCs) and government-linked investment companies (GLICs) to continue pushing DDI investment and support local vendor development in strategic industries such as electrical and electronics (E&amp;E), digital economy and aerospace; and increase financing for export growth, including the Mid-tier Enterprise Development Programme and the Market Development Grant (MDG) by Malaysia External Trade Development Corp (Matrade), with an additional of RM20 million. </p><p>The framework also highlights the need for the capital market to be more active by allowing more firm listings and new local unicorns. </p><p>For this, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) will design a Financial Market Reform Policy that will simplify investment for retail; attract more investors for SMEs as well as the country\u2019s new growth activities; and boost capital market competitiveness globally. </p><p>Malaysia ranks top 20 in the Global Start-up Ecosystem Report 2023 with a value reaching US$46 billion (RM208.38 billion) in the first half of 2020 to 2022. </p><p>Moving forward, the government together with GLICs will invest additional RM1 billion to match private funds to support local start-ups and encourage technopreneurs. </p><p>This includes ensuring the provision of funds for each phase of high-growth companies; expand the implementation of programmes such as Corporate Hackathon and MyHackathon; and allocate an additional RM100 million to intensify the research, development, commercialisation and innovation (R&amp;D&amp;C&amp;I) ecosystem focusing on industrial needs, renewable energy (RE) a, food security and new growth activities; as well as increasing RM100 million of matching grant to assist MSME shift towards a more digital business model for the implementation of Digital ID. </p><p>The framework also envisions Malaysia as the global Islamic economy leader. </p><p>Today, the Islamic banking market accounts for 44.5% of financing (RM974.1 billion), while the Islamic capital market accounts for 64.3% (RM2,322 billion) of the Malaysian capital market. </p><p>\"Although Islamic finance has been established for a long time, we need to transition towards something more sustainable and effective. </p><p>\"Efforts have begun through BNM and the SC to draft the Halalan Tayyiban concept to flow through the Malaysia International Islamic Financial Centre (MIFC) in collaboration with the Islamic financial industry and ecosystem, including zakat and waqf boards, the banking system, and the Islamic stock market and sukuk,\" Anwar said. </p><p>The steps implemented emphasise equity financing, which includes venture capital, equity crowdfunding, and the Islamic digital economy; Islamic social finance; and blended finance approaches, which will utilise capital and finances from a variety of sources. </p><p>Apart from that, the framework emphasised the importance of micro entrepreneurs and the informal sector, with micro-businesses accounting for around 70% of MSMEs. </p><p>The government will also grant a RM100 e-cash credit to all Malaysian adults earning less than RM100,000 per year to approximately 10 million eligible participants, with RM1 billion in subsidies distributed to the bottom 40% (B40) and middle 40% (M40) categories. </p><p>This was inspired by the success of eBeliaRahmah (eBR), an e-cash programme that benefitted two million youths and assisted the business sector in generating money while establishing a paperless society. </p><p>Additionally, the framework highlighted green growth for climate resilience with the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) to promote climate resilience. </p><p>Increasing RE generation capacity, installing solar panels on government buildings, and implementing RE trading policies through the electricity market system are among the main NETR efforts, with the government planning to provide specific incentives to promote new green growth activities. </p><p>Last but not least, there is a section on land use and food security that focuses on developing biodiversity assets for the carbon trading market. </p><p>Malaysia currently has 5.7 million ha of land dedicated to palm oil agriculture, with nearly another two million ha allocated to rubber plantations. </p><p>To improve the self-sufficiency level (SSL) and enhance food security, the government will focus on increasing crop area while optimising the use of existing plantation lands; and increasing the resilience of the agro-food sector through the application of agricultural technology to increase productivity for the benefit of small farmers, including regenerative agriculture approaches, climate-resistant crops, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. </p><p>The government will also improve irrigation infrastructure in Muda Agricultural Development Authority (Mada) areas of Kedah and Perlis to increase paddy production productivity to five seasons within a two-year period, worth RM3 billion; and support the local food industry and increase production with an allocation of RM200 million under Agrobank to help provide financing facilities, particularly for modern agricultural technology applications. </p><p>Elevating Malaysians' Quality of Life </p><p>Apart from aiming Malaysia to be the leader in the Asian region, improving the people's liveability also has become the next focus in the \"Ekonomi Madani: Memperkasa Rakyat\" framework where it comprises of the need for social protection, employment with meaningful wages, and wealth-sharing to build a more equitable and prosperous society. </p><p>Anwar, who is also the finance minister, contended that to measure the success of this economic structural reform is by looking at how far it can develop more job opportunities along with significant wages for Malaysians. </p><p>\"The salary rate compared to the total income in Malaysia is 32.4% for the year 2022. To achieve a more balanced economic sharing, the government will implement policies that support increasing wages relative to GDP to reach the level of 45% in line with more advanced countries,\" he said. </p><p>Reviewing the minimum wage level and the introduction of laws that ensure a safe and comfortable working environment was among the efforts included in the framework. </p><p>To implement minimum wage, the Economic Ministry and Human Resources Ministry looked into the progressive wage model in order to achieve a more comprehensive income growth. </p><p>\"Increasing income in line with productivity is critical to ensuring a meaningful quality of life in addressing the challenges of the cost of living,\" Anwar said. </p><p>On the other hand, Anwar emphasised the need of minimising the dependency of low-skilled foreign labour which contributed to the lower wages. </p><p>He added that the government intended to adopt tiered foreign worker levies, with a portion of the levy increase going towards automation and training programmes for local workers. </p><p>Another focus in elevating the people's livelihood is equal opportunities. </p><p>Anwar acknowledged that the Malays and the Bumiputras were the majority of the citizens facing poverty and in need of assistance. </p><p>On the basis of the social justice concept, equal opportunities shall be provided particularly by providing more aid to underprivileged populations. </p><p>Scholarships and full-boarding school education will emphasise low-income groups. </p><p>\"I firmly believe that only through quality education can we uplift the people from the cocoon of poverty,\" he said. </p><p>The framework also prioritises training and financing programmes for specific groups which include women and youth. </p><p>Hence, the government will allocate an additional RM400 million for micro-loans under agencies such as SME Corp, National Entrepreneurial Group Economic Fund (Tekun), Majlis Amanah Rakyat (Mara), and Bumiputera Agenda Steering Unit (Teraju). </p><p>The government will also execute an industrial policy according to geography through specialised activities and investment by region that is aligned to the comparative advantage and level of development of the respective region. </p><p>The initiative is to reduce the development gap between regions as well as between developed and less developed states. </p><p>\"The Klang Valley will continue to be developed to enhance its competitiveness as one of the major urban centres in Asia. Emphasis will be given to raising liveability and urban sustainability, enabling it to function as a hub for leading companies in the Asean region. </p><p>\"As part of the Kuala Lumpur rejuvenation, the rebuilding of the Sultan Abdul Samad Building and its surroundings will be aligned with the Kuala Lumpur Strategic Master Plan for Creative and Cultural Districts, leveraging its historical heritage to create modern tourism attractions,\" said Anwar. </p><p>While attracting the global inventions and knowledgeable workers to settle in Malaysia, the government will continuously strengthen the development of Iskandar Malaysia in Johor through the establishment of a competitive special financial zone. </p><p>Facilities offered to eligible companies and individuals will include special tax incentives, a 15% tax rate for knowledgeable workers, and fast-track immigration facilities to ease the entry of skilled professionals from abroad. </p><p>Regarding gender gap in the labour market, Anwar asserted that the female labour participation rate is still low at 55.5% compared to 80.9% for male. </p><p>Anwar said there is still a lot to be done to ensure higher participation of women in the workforce. The government's goal is to increase the participation rate to reach 60%. </p><p>It will include immediate efforts including establishing affordable childcare centres - which is a part of the Care-Economy initiative to increase women's workforce participation. </p><p>With the allocation of RM10 million, the government will ease the registration process and expand the childcare centre and nursery whitelisting programme nationwide. </p><p>Meanwhile, the framework also highlighted the social protection for the people; involving three pillars of the Social Protection Programme including prevention through social insurance, sustainable retirement savings and protection through social assistance. </p><p>\"The government has allocated RM100 million for the year 2023 to provide an 80% grant to fund SOCSO contributions for gig workers. However, according to EPF data, more than 40% of the workforce does not have proper retirement savings protection, especially among informal workers. </p><p>\"Therefore, as a starting point to ensure protection for all citizens, the government will gradually expand the coverage of EPF and SOCSO to the working-age population in phases,\" Anwar said, adding that the government will continuously strengthen the employment insurance system and retraining programmes to provide job opportunities for the unemployed. </p><p>Healthcare service reforms is also a top priority, where the allocation for it will be increased in line with the government's financial capacity. </p><p>One example of providing access to quality healthcare is the construction of a RM305 million National Disease Control centre (NDCC) on the outskirts of Negri Sembilan. </p><p>NDCC not only serves as a disease reference centre, but also prepares the country for pandemics that may occur in the future. </p><p>Meanwhile, the government has allocated RM42 million for the Bina Kerjaya Programme, which comprises upskilling programmes for informal workers including gig workers with qualification of Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM) and below. </p><p>Anwar commented that education has been supply-driven for a long time and must be more demand-driven for a better alignment with the needs of development. </p><p>\"We now live in a constantly changing and challenging global economy, so there is a need for a more progressive lifelong learning approach for all Malaysians at all levels,\" he said. </p><p>For land transportation, the government is committed to improving infrastructures in major cities, including implementing Bus Rapid Transport in Johor Baru and light rail transit in Penang. The implementation of Mass Rapid Transit Line 3 (MRT3) in the Klang Valley will also proceed after ensuring a reasonable project cost. </p><p>The government is also keen on ensuring people enjoy basic facilities, where it has allocated an additional RM800 million for quality water supply in Sabah and Kelantan. </p><p>\"We will expedite the implementation of flood mitigation projects, such as those in Kelantan, Pahang, Selangor and Johor,\" he added. </p><p>Anwar further said that the Local Government Development Ministry is now working on the National Housing Action Plan, which includes the provision of housing supply. </p><p>\"We hear the rakyat's grievances of having to postpone owning their first home due to the inability to provide a house purchase deposit. </p><p>\"Therefore, we are enhancing the loan scheme under the Housing Credit Guarantee Corp (HCGS) by providing financing guarantees of up to 120% of the house price, valued up to RM300,000. </p><p>\"The 120% guarantee will cover all homeownership costs through the loan, including the principal financing amount, legal fees, valuation fees, insurance, furniture purchase, and renovation costs. For this, up to RM5 billion will be allocated,\" he explained. </p><p>Good Governance to Restore Confidence </p><p>Anwar said implementation is the key to succeed in the objectives of Ekonomi Madani: Memperkasa Rakyat, adding that it will only work with the support and trust of all parties. </p><p>Under the framework, Anwar contended that media freedom should be uplifted and empowered to provide the people with balanced and accurate news and information. </p><p>He also mentioned that service delivery will be streamlined and digitisation fully maximised to ease daily affairs like paying bills and renewing passports. </p><p>Moreover, the government will provide special appreciation assistance of RM300 for civil servants grade 56 and below, and RM200 to government retirees, including pensioners, issued pension recipients, Employees Provident Fund (EPF) retirees, optional retirees, and those who have not received a pension, as well as pensioned and non-pensioned veterans. </p><p>This special aid will benefit 1.3 million civil servants, including contract appointees, and over one million retirees. </p><p>Next, to bring the social enterprise sector to a higher level, Anwar said there will be more incentives and tax services while the government reevaluates the existing concept of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) to become Philanthropic-Public-Private Partnerships (PPPP). </p><p>Moving forward, Anwar highlighted that rebuilding the country's fiscal capacity is his top priority as he is aware of the debt figures faced by the country. He stressed that a serious crisis that could affect the nation's structure is waiting ahead if there were no reforms taken. </p><p>He admitted that tax revenues are not sufficient to cover operating costs and that the government needs to borrow for development. </p><p>The tax-to-GDP ratio has fallen to 12%, the lowest in the region and a huge amount of money was spent on various subsidies in which, Anwar said, most of it benefited those who were not the target group. </p><p>\"We need more efficient and targeted subsidy mechanisms so that the limited income is allocated to those who need it most. </p><p>\"Despite the need for fiscal reforms, the government guarantees that it will never ignore the plight of the rakyat who are facing a high cost of living and will continue to provide assistance to those in need,\" he said.  </p>", "publisher": "The Malaysian Reserve", "instances": ["Additionally, the framework highlighted green growth for climate resilience with the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) to promote climate resilience.

This involves developing new practices, using new materials, and switching to manufacturing processes that consume less water and energy. Various initiatives keep springing up to drive fashion in a direction that's more sustainable and respectful of the planet, as well as human beings. Here's a look at some of the most innovative approaches underway as the world celebrates Earth Day, April 22.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If upcycling, clothing repair and buying second-hand currently stand out as essential alternatives for making fashion more responsible, many in the sector are working on new solutions to considerably reduce the carbon footprint of our wardrobes. Some of these often surprising solutions could contribute to revolutionising the textile industry as we know it.</p><p>3D printing to limit waste</p><p>From small French company 3D-Tex to the renowned American designer Heron Preston to the Portland-based sustainable shoe brand Hilos, more and more fashion firms and designers are embracing 3D printing as a means to offer greener pieces, focusing on zero waste and circularity. The idea is to shift to a more ecological manufacturing process, while limiting waste and offering more resistant creations, some of which can be infinitely recyclable.</p><p>That's the challenge taken up by the Saint-Malo-based start-up 3D-Tex, which defines itself as the \"first fully 3D knitting workshop in France,\" on its official website. The company manufactures sweaters-but also hats-in 3D and without seams thanks to a technology that seriously cuts down on waste. It's an initiative that has already won over many brands, starting with TBS and Le Slip Francais, and which could serve as an example in many other sectors.</p><p>While 3D printing is on a mission to revolutionise the knitwear sector in France, it seems to have already conquered the footwear sector in the United States. This is evidenced by various projects from the likes of Heron Preston and Hilos. The former presented the first 3D-printed sneakers that can be infinitely recycled in the fall of 2021, while the latter is currently producing four models of shoes made on demand using this technology, thus addressing a number of issues such as overproduction, stock shortages and energy savings. These three initiatives demonstrate the industry's enthusiasm for 3D printing as one of the most innovative solutions for a more sustainable future.</p><p>Turning waste into clothing</p><p>While upcycling allows many brands to give a second life to their fabric scraps and surplus or used clothes, some in the industry have gone even further by transforming waste-sometimes even components whose concentration in the atmosphere is one of the factors behind global warming. Incredible, but true. The objective is to depollute the environment while proposing new creations that do not require any new raw material.</p><p>The TchaoMegot company takes an unusual approach by recycling... cigarette butts. These are collected, then cleaned through an ecological process, before being transformed into eco-designed insulation used in the padding of certain puffer jackets. It's upcycling taken to a whole new level, while also raising awareness about the pollution generated by this common waste item, which still has a disastrous impact on the oceans.</p><p>In a different vein, the California-based start-up Newlight Technologies has developed AirCarbon, a carbon-negative biomaterial made from greenhouse gases. It took more than a decade to develop this innovation, which is of great interest to fashion giants such as Nike, which has partnered with the company to explore the use of AirCarbon in various applications. While we wait to learn more about the products resulting from this collaboration, shoppers can already discover Covalent, Newlight Technologies' own brand, which offers bags and sunglasses designed made using the biomaterial.</p><p>And because every such initiative contributes to improving the health of the planet, ready-to-wear brands are also mobilising for Earth Day. Projects include UGG's new carbon-neutral Icon-Impact collection, which includes the Fluff Yeah Terry, Fuzz Sugar Terry Slide and Fuzz Sugar Terry Cross Slide, and the new Classic Mini Regenerat shoe, which uses sheepskin from regenerative agriculture farms, not to mention Vans' Eco Positivity collection, which focuses on more sustainable materials such as organic cotton, hemp and organic foam made from vegetable oils.</p><p>Canada Goose is presenting its new Kind Fleece made from recycled wool and biobased fibers.

Barnes and his neighbours in southern Spain are turning to pre-industrial methods they hope will avert the risk of their land turning into desert to grow crops that command higher prices from increasingly environmentally-aware consumers. Part of a growing international movement to harness the power of the soil to combat climate change, they leave grassy plants to wither in the fields, forming fertiliser that protects the soil, and have reduced tilling. </p><p>\"The soil here was poor, degraded, pale and lifeless. Now it has changed colour, the structure has changed, it's looser,\" Barnes, 35, said at the hangar where his family has processed almonds, one of the area's most prolific crops, for 40 years. When Spain imposed some of Europe's most stringent curbs on movement in March to deal with the spread of the new coronavirus, Barnes managed to make some deliveries to markets including Germany, and kept employees busy with maintenance. Demand evaporated just as predictions of a bumper harvest pushed down prices, leaving him braced for a marked, but not ruinous, drop in income this year of 20,000 euros (US$21,794). But while finances waver, the land looks stronger, with more insects visible among the plants, indicating strengthening biodiversity, and offering the farmers hope for the future. \"If you leave the land alone it regenerates ... the lockdown has been good for the land and the countryside,\" Barnes said. More than a third of land globally is degraded in some way, according to the United Nations. But this stretch north of the ancient Arab stronghold of Granada shows it is possible to transform challenging landscapes, said Amsterdam-based foundation Commonland, which aims to support businesses to restore the landscape.

A report by think tank Orbitas looked at the financial risks to tropical farmers and agricultural businesses - including palm oil, soybean and beef - if they do not adapt to new climate actions by governments, companies and consumers. It found that those risks are as significant in agriculture as they are in the energy and transport sectors. If temperature increases are capped at 1.5 degrees Celsius, in line with the lower temperature goal of the Paris climate accord, up to 600 million ha of agricultural land - or more than 10 per cent of agricultural land globally - will need to revert to forests, the report said. READ: The Thai government wanted to pave paradise, but this forest community said no This is partly due to an expectation that prices paid for carbon storage in forests could rise above the revenue that could be obtained from using that same land for agriculture, said Mark Kenber, managing director of Orbitas. </p><p>\"A response to climate change that gets the world anywhere close to net-zero emissions will require farming and agro industry to transform,\" Kenber added. \"This is an enormous blind spot for investors.\" In 2019, tropical rainforests - whose preservation is considered crucial to limiting planetary heating - disappeared at a rate of one football pitch every six seconds, according to data from online monitoring service Global Forest Watch. Green groups blame the production of palm oil, the world's most widely used edible oil, and other agricultural commodities for much of the destruction, as carbon-storing forests are cleared for plantations, ranches and farms. READ: Southeast Asia's palm oil industry touts sustainability narrative, but activists cast doubts Environmentalists say conserving existing forests and restoring damaged ones reduce the risk of drought and flooding, store more planet-warming carbon and protect threatened biodiversity. The Orbitas study focused on tropical farmers and agriculture businesses, many of which have large land banks for future expansion on their balance sheets. It analysed the consequences for these firms from changing climate change policy - such as government carbon financing and forest protection schemes, corporate zero-deforestation and emissions pledges, and changes in consumer habits. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b It found that companies whose business strategies rely on expansion into forested territories will confront vastly increased land prices and possibly no access at all. Those that already hold forest concessions as land banks will face significant asset stranding, although they could benefit from carbon credits if they adapt their businesses and become more sustainable and transparent. READ: Explainer - Why forests matter as carbon sinks and what we can do to protect them \"Even under pretty modest policy, deforestation will have to end quite soon - and that's between 2025 to 2040 - depending on the carbon price and strength of policy,\" London-based Kenber told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. COMING WRITE-OFFS In Indonesia, up to 76 per cent of unplanted forest concessions and 15 per cent of existing palm oil assets could be written down or off under a meaningful national climate transition, the report said. Carbon credits and regulations will further disrupt agricultural businesses, it said, with global palm oil, beef, and soybean producers facing up to US$19 billion in additional costs each year. \"Demand for palm oil is going to continue to grow whatever happens. Those who will win will be those who can satisfy that demand by sustainably increasing yields (on existing land), managing their emissions and looking for complementary revenue streams,\" said Kenber. LISTEN: Feeding the planet and heating it up - How agriculture impacts our environment Public and private finance will be needed to enable small-scale palm oil growers - who are responsible for about 40 per cent of output from top producing countries Indonesia and Malaysia - to also improve their yields, he added. By investing in sustainable intensification, regenerative agriculture, and diversifying revenue streams, forward-looking agricultural companies will see their net value and profitability rise under climate transitions, the report said. Robin Chazdon, a professor at Australia's University of the Sunshine Coast who has researched the best places to replant forests, said caring for land and water must become the new bottom line - not only for communities and countries but also for businesses and corporations.

For businesses, \"the resulting losses of biodiversity, escalating carbon emissions, and decline of ecosystem services have been externalised and dismissed as 'not my problem'\", she said. \"Now these issues have become everyone's problem and the fate of the planet hangs in the balance.\" Tom Picken, a director at green group Rainforest Action Network, said investors that continue to finance forest destruction, rights abuses and climate change are risking their bottom line as governments and markets increasingly recognise forest areas as no-go zones for expansion. \"Feeding the world does not have to mean cutting down more forests,\" Picken said. - Reuters/dv</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["COMING WRITE-OFFS In Indonesia, up to 76 per cent of unplanted forest concessions and 15 per cent of existing palm oil assets could be written down or off under a meaningful national climate transition, the report said.

LISTEN: Feeding the planet and heating it up - How agriculture impacts our environment Public and private finance will be needed to enable small-scale palm oil growers - who are responsible for about 40 per cent of output from top producing countries Indonesia and Malaysia - to also improve their yields, he added. By investing in sustainable intensification, regenerative agriculture, and diversifying revenue streams, forward-looking agricultural companies will see their net value and profitability rise under climate transitions, the report said. Robin Chazdon, a professor at Australia's University of the Sunshine Coast who has researched the best places to replant forests, said caring for land and water must become the new bottom line - not only for communities and countries but also for businesses and corporations.

The open letter was signed by more than 45 individuals representing 36 not-for-profit social enterprises and arts groups. They include Nominated Members of Parliament Anthea Ong, Walter Theseira, Irene Quay and Yip Pin Xiu. \"We, the undersigned organisations and individuals, are seeking to strengthen the Emerging Stronger Taskforce by making it more representative of our society,\" the letter said. \"The task force should include members of the people sector, economic players that are most vulnerable, as well as businesses focused on bringing a climate-safe future. \"It should also seek to achieve the cultural, gender and demographic diversity of our nation, including representation from the disability community,\" it added. </p><p>READ: New task force on economic resilience to help Singapore bounce back from COVID-19 crisis The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities in Singapore's society and economy, and efforts to rebuild a country that can better withstand future shocks should include those who have been most impacted, said the signatories. While the Government has said it will consult multiple stakeholders during the process, a \"more formal engagement of issues\" faced by those most severely hit by the pandemic is needed, they added. First announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Apr 7, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce aims to look at how Singapore can stay economically resilient beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. It is chaired by Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee and PSA International's group chief executive officer Tan Chong Meng. The task force announced the appointment of 15 business leaders as members in early-May. They represent large corporations in sectors such as banking, property, healthcare, technology and aviation. Of the 15 members, two are women. Workers' Party MP Sylvia Lim had raised questions about the diversity of the task force during the debate on the Fortitude Budget earlier this month. Noting the lack of female representation, Ms Lim questioned if the task force would be able to adequately address the issue of women being disproportionately affected by COVID-19. She also highlighted a weak representation of multi-racial voices and the absence of representatives from small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). READ: WP MPs question lack of women in COVID-19 economic task force, role of President in use of reserves A REPRESENTATIVE TASK FORCE The open letter suggested that the task force be expanded to include at least one representative from the social sector who is formally supported by an advisory council of non-profits, charities and academics, as well as at least one environmentally friendly business. It should also have a greater representation of vulnerable economic players, such as SMEs, social enterprises, self-employed individuals and workers in the gig economy. Membership should also reflect the cultural, gender and demographic diversity of Singapore, the signatories suggested. This includes having women make up at least 30 per cent of the task force, minorities including Malays being represented, and representation of youth, elders and persons with disabilities. READ: The economic impact of a pandemic: 'Without COVID-19, we would be doing ok' The letter said the challenges of COVID-19 has \"disproportionately\" impacted underprivileged groups in the society and underrepresented certain sectors of the Singapore economy. It noted that relief measures announced as part of an unprecedented combination of four Budgets have cushioned some impact, but that the \"systemic shifts\" brought about by COVID-19 and their impact will have to be identified and assessed, the letter said. These include improving the well-being and progress of low-wage workers to help them save for rainy days, ensuring the health, safety and fair compensation of essential workers especially in times of crisis, closing gaps in social safety nets for those more vulnerable, as well as bridging the digital divides in low-income and elderly communities. READ: Singapore's jobless rate highest in 10 years, total employment registers record decline in Q1 Ms Margaret Thomas, president of the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE), described emerging stronger as an economy with more room for local enterprises to thrive and a society with more comprehensive social safety nets. \"One way to ensure this is for the task force to have at its table the voices of those who have been the most vulnerable during the COVID-19 crisis - women, older Singaporeans, the disabled, workers in the gig economy, SMEs,\" she said. Representatives of Community for Advocacy and Political Education (CAPE), a student organisation based in Yale-NUS College, said it is crucial for members of the youth, academics and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to be represented in the task force. \"Young people's futures will be the most impacted post-pandemic. Many NGOs work closely with marginalised and underrepresented groups (that) provide important perspective. Academics provide informed opinions and are vital for the development of an advanced future-ready knowledge economy,\" said Ms Huang Runchen and Ms Nur Aina Binte Sapari from CAPE. Singapore's economic drivers should also be transformed to those that are \"regenerative\", the letter said. It cited how the World Economic Forum had noted recently that continued reliance on extractive industries, such as activities leading to deforestation, or intensive agriculture and livestock farming, will increase risks of future pandemics. \"Continued reliance on carbon intensive industries including aviation and tourism not only increases the risk of climate breakdown, but also exposes our economy to the inherent volatile nature of fossil-based commodities,\" the letter said. There are new circular-based systems such as regenerative agriculture that seeks to balance food production with ecosystem needs. These are already being worked on by several companies, including those in Singapore. \"Focusing on jobs for the future in a circular and regenerative economy and choosing nature-based solutions to ensure we are reducing the risk of climate breakdown is crucial,\" the letter said. Noting the presence of large corporations and fossil fuel companies in the task force, CAPE's representatives said: \"As we look towards a climate crisis and prepare for the decarbonisation of our economy, it seems imperative that we include innovative businesses and start-ups that are working towards this aim.\" Mr Ho Xiangtian, co-founder of environmental group LepakInSG, said the task force must include leaders in the circular economy, environmental protection, and low carbon sectors given how a climate crisis looms behind the COVID-19 pandemic. Doing so will ensure that \"we don't go out of the COVID-19 frying pan into the climate crisis fire,\" he said. Ms Tok Xinying, co-founder of environmental group Climate Conversations and lead author of the open letter, said: \"Coming out of the COVID-19 crisis, where we saw many groups and individuals step up, the letter's signatories collectively expressed a hope for continued active citizenry and a formal integration of societal concerns into future economic planning.\" BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the coronavirus outbreak and its developments Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cna.asia/telegram\">https://cna.asia/telegram</url></p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["Many NGOs work closely with marginalised and underrepresented groups (that) provide important perspective.

Despite the fact that some vegetables can be cultivated with a \"soilless\" hydroponic method, the majority of food and commodity crops that feed and fuel the world rely on earthy soil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Based on the latest World Bank statistics of 210 countries, Malaysia is ranked number 76 with 7.8 million hectares of agricultural land in 2015, compared with the largest agricultural country, China, with 527.8 million hectares.</p><p>The world's total of 4.9 billion hectares of agricultural land in 2015 has been on a declining trend since 2008. To raise awareness of soil health, year 2015 has been coined as the year of soils (IYS2015) and Dec 5 as World Soil Day by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p><p>Land is a limited natural resource. Only around three per cent of land is suitable for agriculture; the thin layer on top represents the soil on which we grow crops.</p><p>The gradual weathering of rocks takes hundreds of years to form one centimetre of soil, and in the case of fertile soil with enough organic matter, it will take thousands of years. Furthermore, soil is constantly threatened by intensive farming, which leads to nutrient depletion, accumulation of agrochemicals, soil erosion and compaction.</p><p>Soil is regarded as a non-renewable resource: it is lost forever once destroyed. Therefore, it is imperative for us to take good care of our ever-shrinking arable land by considering soil health.</p><p>Soil health goes beyond soil quality in that it covers the concept of continued capacity and vital living system to sustain a diverse community of soil organisms known as biota.</p><p>Healthy soil also contributes to climate change mitigation through carbon assimilation. Sustainable farming such as intercropping or crop rotation promotes healthy soils by keeping the soil nutrient balanced and reducing pests. This is particularly pertinent to small-scale farmers in Malaysia; not only can the manure from livestock serve as organic fertiliser or feed for aquaculture, but also multiple cropping can diversify income from different produce.</p><p>For larger-scale farmers in oil palm or rubber plantations, maintaining soil health will often heavily rely on chemical fertilisers which serve as an easy solution. However, this could result in excessive use of agrochemicals that can be harmful to soil biota.</p><p>Chemical fertilisers can be described as medicine in treating acute nutrient deficiency in plants; organic fertilisers are akin to natural herbal remedies; while biofertilisers with beneficial microbial enrichment are like health supplements or prebiotic drinks.</p><p>To maintain a healthy soil is like maintaining human health, which will require balanced intake of nutrients or proper medication for specific diseases. There is no shortcut or \"one prescription for all\" solution to soil health, which requires integrated management of fertiliser application accordingly.</p><p>This ingenious concept has been applied as a solution to basal stem rot (BSR) disease that is threatening our oil palm industry. BSR is caused by a fungus known as Ganoderma boninenses which invades through the roots and degrades the trunk of oil palm inside out. By the time farmers detect the fruiting bodies that are shaped like a Lingzhi mushroom, it is too late to save the tree. The tell-tale signs of infected trees include spearing young leaves and skirting of yellowing older leaves.</p><p>Based on the concept of plant nutrient supplement, trees surrounding the infected tree can be prevented from getting BSR by providing biofertilisers with special formulation to promote plant lignin formation. Lignin is a class of organic polymers that make wood hard by reinforcing the plant cell wall. When the pathogenic fungus cannot invade trees with impenetrable roots, disease spreading is prevented. To put it simply, a strong healthy person is less likely to get infected by another flu patient.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to maintain healthy soils with all the micronutrients necessary for a healthy plant to grow than just supplying macronutrients from chemical fertilisers alone.</p><p>In short, maintaining soil health is not only important for preventing plant diseases and sustaining crop yield to ensure food security, but also to maintain a balanced ecosystem of soil biota for biodiversity.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a new concept of regenerative agriculture to reclaim loss of infertile soils through organic farming practices, such as conservation tillage, cover crops, composting, biochar, and pasture cropping.</p><p>The recent Malaysia International Agriculture Technology Exhibition has provided a great opportunity for all the stakeholders in agro-industry to meet and showcase the latest technology in promoting soil health and educating farmers on its importance.</p><p>Before farmers can dream of a bumper crop, they must first take good care of the soil!</p><p>The writer is a leader of Plant Functional Genomics Research Group at the Institute of Systems Biology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia</p><p>( END )</p>", "publisher": "New Straits Times (Malaysia)", "instances": ["Lignin is a class of organic polymers that make wood hard by reinforcing the plant cell wall.

From this, we make the most diverse and rich compost nature can provide and grow 20 tonnes a year of vegetables on just over one acre of land.</p><p>Currently there are three FOLO Farms in Johor. The first, a 0.5 acre farm at Kempas is open to FOLO members and the public on Saturdays for farm tours. \"The 6-acre Ban Foo farm holds our compost facility while the 5-acre Kukup site used to be a palm oil plantation and is undergoing soil recovery.\"</p><p>To connect with the hotels and restaurants to source for food waste, Chua's team had to do quite a bit of legwork. He says, \"We did old fashioned door-to-door knocking. It was really tough at the beginning - many businesses just could not be bothered to separate their food waste from other waste such as plastics. Some wanted us to pay, some wanted us to be their garbage collectors and some just chased us out!\"</p><p>The FOLO team's persistence paid off when Renaissance Hotel Johor Baru decided to work with them to create a system of collection and a feedback procedure that involved everyone. Chua says, \"The hotel owner, Mr Lee, and the executive chef, Chef Mahady, were very supportive. We drove the truck ourselves so we could educate the Nepalese hotel stewards on the environment and why we were doing this - the Nepalese love nature! Once they understood, our waste became very clean in only 1-2 months.\"</p><p>With the first partner on board, it became easier to recruit the others though FOLO Farms still faced other challenges. Chua explains, \"None of us were trained as food waste composters, urban organic farmers, community organizers or vegetable sellers. So every day we have to make collective decisions based on what we know, but also with humility, respect and faith in nature and the unknown. It's a little scary but we try and forge ahead leaning on one another as a team, and on the community we serve and feed.\"</p><p>At FOLO Farms, everyone is involved as their modus operandi is to work together as an intergenerational team of families. Chua shares, \"It's different and at times challenging when my mum, my best friend's dad and daughter sit in meetings alongside our team members. So we have to constantly find the balance between making efficient decisions and building consensus. We have no choice but to be genuine and real.\"</p><p>These traits resonate with Chua, who tries to live by a philosophy of true generosity. He says, \"I believe that understanding what is really needed and giving all that we can is by far the best savings, the best investment and yields the best returns - economical, social and spiritual. I don't know if this helps me as an entrepreneur but it helps me as a small human being.\"</p><p>Not wanting to rest on his laurels, Chua has many ideas for the next stage of FOLO Farms. This includes improving their processes for composting and growing vegetables as well as levelling up from an urban farm community to supporting an urban farm movement.</p><p>He adds, \"We also want to train talented young adults who want to gently rebel against our crazy industrial food system, grow food for their community and do something for our planet. This means distilling the wisdom of our mentors and our own experience, and offering it as classes, apprenticeships and maybe even future training courses at our farm.\"</p><p>Looks like it takes a village - or a farm - to make the world a better place.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.
