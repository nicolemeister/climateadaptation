Developed and developing nations must be treated differently as far as climate action is concerned. In the view of Malaysia, a view shared by many vulnerable nations around the world, climate justice would only come about if the responsibilities of the two are differentiated according to development levels, historical contributions to emissions and current capacities, a principle that comes labelled as \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR). Or, put differently, first emitters pay more principle. Makes good sense as industrialised nations are historically responsible for emitting planet-heating pollution. But the funding from the industrialised polluters of old to flesh out this CBDR principle is very slow in coming. After 29 years of the United Nations climate summits \u00e2\u20ac\u201d officially known as the Conference of Parties (COP) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d only US$200 billion was provided for climate adaptation and mitigation when what is needed is US$3 trillion. Small wonder, COPs are labelled cop-outs.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Newly installed United States President Donald Trump has got emissions right and wrong at the same time. Call it the Trump paradox. Signing the executive order to withdraw the US from the Paris climate treaty, he is reported by The Guardian to have told his supporters on his first day as president thus: \"The United States will not sabotage its own industries while China pollutes with impunity. China uses a lot of dirty energy, but they produce a lot of energy. When that stuff goes up in the air, it doesn't stay there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It floats into the United States of America after three and a half to five and half days.\" Similarly, Mr President, the stuff that goes up in the air in the US doesn't stay there either. It floats into Mexico, Canada and the rest of the world, may be not in so many days, but in weeks for sure. But the first victims of the \"dirty energy\" will be Americans. In this sense, what is not good for the US is also not good for the rest of the world.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Knowing that dirty energy doesn't stay where it originates, Trump shouldn't shred the world's climate agenda as he did. Energy transition will suffer. Developed and developing countries have invested a lot in renewable energy to stabilise the climate. More funding is needed to transition from \"dirty energy\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to continue the Trumpian phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to clean energy. Wildfires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts and other climate calamities are no longer country- or continent-specific. And they would only get worse if the Paris treaty target is ignored. Adverse weather has its own momentum. No country can afford to be caught unprepared. Being prepared means investing a lot in stabilising the climate, not less. Vulnerable countries, like those in Southeast Asia, are not at an economic development stage like the industrialised ones to self-fund climate stabilising measures.

It simply allows those with power - governments, corporations, and ideological groups -to dictate the direction of higher education without challenge.</p><p>The question is not whether universities are political, but what kind of political actors they choose to be.</p><p>Do they act as defenders of truth, critical thought, and academic freedom? Or do they become instruments of state control, corporate influence, and ideological conformity?</p><p>Knowledge is power and power is always political</p><p>At the core of every university is knowledge production, and the production of knowledge is never neutral.</p><p>Decisions about what is taught, which research is funded, and whose perspectives are prioritised are deeply political.</p><p>In an ideal world, universities would be spaces where diverse ideas flourish, where knowledge is pursued for the common good, and where academics are free to challenge prevailing wisdom.</p><p>But in reality, knowledge production is shaped by state interests, corporate influence, and the political economy of higher education.</p><p>One of the clearest examples of this is the way research funding is allocated. Governments direct funding toward research that aligns with national priorities - whether in security, economic growth, or technological innovation - while discouraging work that challenges state narratives.</p><p>In many countries, research on human rights, social justice, and government accountability struggles for funding, while studies on economic development, counterterrorism, and technological advancement thrive.</p><p>This is not an accident. It is a political decision that determines which ideas receive legitimacy and which remain in the margins.</p><p>The curriculum itself is another battleground. Universities shape public understanding by deciding whose knowledge is taught and whose is excluded.</p><p>Calls to \"decolonise\" the curriculum - by incorporating indigenous knowledge, feminist perspectives, and Global South scholarship - are met with fierce resistance in many institutions, revealing just how deeply entrenched traditional power structures are in academia.</p><p>A refusal to revise curricula in response to these critiques is not a neutral stance - it is an active decision to preserve historical hierarchies in knowledge production.</p><p>Universities as extensions of state power</p><p>Universities are not just centres of knowledge; they are also institutions of governance, often operating under direct or indirect state control.</p><p>Public universities receive government funding, and even private universities function within national regulatory frameworks.</p><p>This creates significant vulnerabilities, making universities susceptible to political interference.</p><p>One of the most obvious ways this plays out is through the politicisation of university leadership. In many countries, governments appoint university vice-chancellors, rectors, and board members based on political loyalty rather than academic merit.</p><p>These appointments often come with an unspoken expectation: protect the state, silence dissent, and ensure that universities do not become hubs of political resistance.</p><p>This influence extends to the suppression of academic freedom and student activism.</p><p>Historically, universities have been hotbeds of political movements, with students and faculty at the forefront of struggles for democracy, civil rights, and social justice.</p><p>But state authorities often view universities as threats rather than partners in democratic development.</p><p>As a result, student protests are met with heavy-handed crackdowns, and academics who criticise the government risk losing their jobs or facing legal action.</p><p>The repression of academic freedom is particularly evident in countries where authoritarianism is on the rise.</p><p>In Turkey, thousands of academics have been dismissed from their positions for expressing political dissent.</p><p>In Hong Kong, university administrators have been pressured to discipline students involved in pro-democracy protests.</p><p>In Thailand, student-led movements advocating for monarchy reform have led to arrests and academic penalties.</p><p>These are not isolated cases. They illustrate a broader trend in which universities serve as enforcers of state control rather than spaces of critical inquiry.</p><p>The corporate takeover of higher education</p><p>If state influence is one side of the coin, corporate influence is the other. The rise of neoliberalism in higher education has transformed universities into profit-driven institutions, prioritising market demands over intellectual exploration.</p><p>Universities now compete for international students, climb global rankings, and seek lucrative partnerships with private industry - all of which come at a cost.</p><p>One of the clearest signs of this shift is the commodification of education. Universities increasingly operate like businesses, treating students as customers and faculty as service providers.</p><p>Adjunct faculty work under precarious conditions, while tenured positions become harder to secure.</p><p>The humanities and social sciences, which foster critical thinking, receive less funding and institutional support than STEM disciplines, which attract corporate and government investment.</p><p>Research, too, is shaped by corporate interests.

We can accept the increasing restrictions on academic freedom and allow universities to become institutions of conformity, or we can fight for them to remain spaces of critical inquiry, resistance, and societal progress."]}, {"relevance_score": 31, "title": "Nik Nazmi planting seeds of change in climate leadership", "published": "2025-01-19", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE national launch of Saving the Planet \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Climate and Environmental Lessons from Malaysia and Beyond took place on Jan 11.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This book by Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad offers insights into his journey as a young political figure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since assuming the role in December 2022, Nik Nazmi has faced a baptism of fire, navigating the complexities of environmental governance at national and global levels.</p><p>His work has spanned pressing issues, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, microplastic pollution and politically charged federal-state conflicts over forests, land and water.</p><p>These challenges go back decades and were taken up at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where two landmark multilateral treaties were signed: the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.</p><p>At that time, Nik Nazmi was just 10.

Its funding heavily relied on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is responsible for administering the country's civilian foreign aid and development assistance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Weeks after the funding tap was turned off, the Manushya Foundation has seen some of its most critical functions halted or scaled back. Most at risk are the activists across Asia that the organisation helps keep safe, a function that is mostly hidden from public view, she explained.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The foundation supports environmental defenders, climate justice groups, indigenous peoples groups and political activists \"being targeted\", typically by governments, across the region including most of Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Mongolia.</p><p>\"We have nine safe houses in Bangkok where we can hide families and activists that come to hide in Thailand, hoping to be resettled to a third country and we also provide a lot of rapid response grants,\" she said. Many activists can find themselves in imminent danger and need assistance at short notice, she explained. \"(The public doesn't) know that we are protecting activists, hiding them, providing grants, because that's the work that we didn't want to be that visible to be able to do it well.\"</p><p>Manushya Foundation, according to Pradichit, saw its 2025 funds worth US$560,000 for such projects disappear.</p><p>Its five-year project is all but over; the organisation has been forced to downsize its operations, cut staff and let go of safe houses. Only the most at-risk activists are still receiving support while others will now have to fend for themselves.</p><p>\"It's not a funding crisis. It's a question of life and death. The activists that we were hiding, tomorrow, they can be killed because they're no longer in our safe houses,\" she said.</p><p>The US is the world's largest donor of aid, allocating US$54 billion in fiscal year 2024, according to partial reporting figures on ForeignAssistance.gov, the federal government's official foreign aid website.</p><p>US development assistance has been in the crosshairs of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close adviser to Trump.</p><p>A US federal judge ruled on Mar 19 that DOGE likely violated the US constitution by shuttering USAID, ordering that the Trump administration reverse some of its actions.</p><p>But in the midst of legal battles, USAID staff were forced to leave their foreign postings and cut communications with their field partners. This has created general confusion in Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere in the region, causing operational work that supports vulnerable communities to run aground.</p><p>Stakeholders also told CNA reforms to humanitarian aid are needed, even as governments worldwide increasingly reduce foreign aid budgets and are more willing to offer concessional loans instead.</p><p>Globally, USAID is set to slash 5,200 of its 6,200 programmes, a move designed to cancel the spending of \"tens of billions of dollars\" in ways that hurt or did not serve the core national interests of the US, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on the social media platform X.</p><p>For fiscal year 2024, the US allocated about US$4.1 billion in foreign aid to East Asia and Oceania, which includes Southeast Asia. The Sub-Saharan Africa region was the largest beneficiary with an allocation of almost US$14 billion.</p><p>Of the US$4.1 billion allocated to East Asia and Oceania, more than half - or US$2.3 billion - was managed by the Department of State.</p><p>USAID oversaw US$1 billion of the total allocation, while the rest was managed by agencies that include the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Department of Agriculture. A CNA tally of figures on ForeignAssistance.gov indicated that USAID allocated US$837.3 million to eight of the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations last year. Singapore and Brunei did not appear to be allocated funds managed by USAID.</p><p>These include US$237.6 million for Myanmar, US$151.3 million for Indonesia, US$135.4 million for Vietnam and US$20.45 million for Thailand.</p><p>Throughout Southeast Asia, the dismantling of USAID has left small grassroots organisations like Thailand's Manushya Foundation reeling.</p><p>That's because a percentage of USAID's funding typically trickles down to smaller groups doing hands-on work in communities, from malaria prevention to anti-human trafficking, health support for refugees and clean energy.</p><p>\"The world has crumbled around us, at least as far as foreign assistance to development in Southeast Asia goes,\" said Phil Robertson, the director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates (AHRLA) at a panel discussion in Bangkok last week.</p><p>\"It's a tremendous upheaval. People are in shock, People are depressed. People are dismayed,\" he said at the event organised by SEA Junction, a non-profit that aims to foster greater sociocultural understanding of Southeast Asia.</p><p>For fiscal year 2024, Indonesia (US$791.4 million) received the highest allocation of overall US foreign aid among Southeast Asian nations, followed by the Philippines (US$695.1 million) and Vietnam (US$264.1 million), according to ForeignAssistance.gov.</p><p>Thailand and Malaysia were allocated US$38.7 million and US$2.6 million respectively.</p><p>These sums include allocations from various US agencies, including USAID.</p><p>Reuters reported on Feb 6 that Indonesia's health partnerships with USAID were on hold with no indication of whether they would resume, straining Jakarta's efforts against HIV and tuberculosis, which replaced COVID-19 to become the top cause of infectious disease-related deaths globally in 2023.</p><p>A key USAID initiative in Indonesia is the Together Towards Elimination and Freedom From TB (USAID BEBAS TB) programme, launched in July 2023, news outlet Jakarta Globe reported this month.</p><p>The five-year US$70 million initiative aims to improve detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of TB, supporting Indonesia's goal of eliminating the disease by 2030.</p><p>The Indonesian government has said it has the financial resources to sustain development efforts without relying heavily on foreign aid.</p><p>\"All this time, the Indonesian government has always considered international funding - regardless of where (the funds) come from - as something that is supplementary. The main source of funding has always been our state budget,\" Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Rolliansyah \"Roy\" Soemirat told a press briefing this month.</p><p>In the Philippines, USAID cuts have threatened the fight against rising HIV cases, with the country's LGBTQ rights groups forced to find new financing strategies and sources of funding.</p><p>As for Vietnam, the Associated Press reported on Mar 20 that USAID cuts have halted a rehabilitation programme for war victims as well as efforts to clear unexploded American munitions and landmines.</p><p>In addition to exposing thousands of people to health hazards, the cuts risk jeopardising the US' diplomatic gains with Vietnam, a country Washington could seek support from to counter an increasingly aggressive China, the report said. HEALTH SERVICE IMPACTS</p><p>Frontline healthcare for the LGBTQ community is one area where the aid cuts have hit hard and fast in Thailand.</p><p>According to an analysis by the Service Workers IN Group Foundation (SWING Thailand), there are close to 700,000 people in Thailand receiving services related to HIV under a policy called the Reach-Recruit-Test-Treat-Retain approach. It is part of a national strategy to eliminate HIV/AIDS in Thailand by 2030.</p><p>But the analysis, based on data from the National Health Security Office, found that 85 per cent of those receiving related care was through civil society groups rather than the national health system.</p><p>Some 60 per cent of those receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection also do it through NGOs. Without this medication, individuals face higher HIV transmission risks.</p><p>\"The NGOs provide care for vulnerable groups and for groups that are not able to get access from other sources ... let's say if you don't have documents, you're a migrant or have a feeling of being discriminated against by a care provider,\" said Kaona Saowakun, vice-president of the Isaan Gender Diversity Network Foundation.</p><p>\"So that's why they're impacted a lot. It could take the lives of people. It's the sudden decision. No one could prepare for that. Meaning they (the US government) don't care about the impact,\" he added.</p><p>Chamrong Phangnongyang, the deputy director of SWING, said his organisation had a mandate under USAID to provide free services to people of five nationalities: Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.</p><p>Now, while they won't deny service to migrants, the services are no longer fully covered, unlike for Thais who could receive assistance through the National Health Security Office.</p><p>It could impact tens of thousands of people annually and the response from Thai authorities has been muted so far on this issue, he said.</p><p>\"Does the country (Thailand) not realise this? Why is the country so silent, acting like nothing has happened? Can we really just let community organisations collapse without doing anything?\"</p><p>Kaona estimated that among the dozens of organisations in Thailand working in the LGBTQ health space, some would have lost just a-tenth of their total funding, while for others it is as high as 60 per cent.</p><p>\"Right now the impact is predictable. It's either suspend activities, close the project, shut offices, cut staff benefits or cut the staffing itself,\" he said. The impact on Thailand will be two-fold as US funding is directed both to the Thai government's health programmes and civil society groups.</p><p>Small media organisations are also impacted. The Irrawaddy, a news website founded by Burmese exiles living in Thailand, was also a recipient of USAID funding until it was frozen.</p><p>It has conducted detailed reporting in recent years about political upheaval in Myanmar, human rights issues, the ongoing civil war and security situation and chronicled the struggles of marginalised communities.</p><p>Its editor-in-chief Aung Zaw said at the SEA Junction event that it remains unclear if all 65 staff members can be retained, or how many might need to be let go.</p><p>\"We are thinking about what we can cut or suspend to keep our core team working. This is what we are thinking for the long term to survive,\" he said.</p><p>For the frontline organisations in Thailand struggling to stay afloat, finding new sources of funding presents a steep challenge.</p><p>Those that CNA spoke with had different ideas - from looking domestically at what national governments could cover to forging new relationships with philanthropy groups.</p><p>There was an acceptance, however, that America's money was probably not coming back anytime soon.</p><p>\"We have to accept the fact that many of us have to downsize. So, our goal is not to get bigger, but our goal is to focus on what we are doing well and prioritise that,\" Pradichit of Manushya Foundation said.</p><p>\"We have to rethink how we get funded. And we have to be innovative.\" SITUATION IN MALAYSIA</p><p>Over in Malaysia, the executive director of North South Initiative, a migrant rights group, said the USAID funding cuts have affected its partners - usually regional NGOs - and caused it to lose about 40 per cent of its \"core funding\".</p><p>\"Certain projects were directly terminated by our partners. So that means staff in those terminated projects will either need to be laid off or repositioned in another project if there are sufficient funds,\" Adrian Pereira told CNA.</p><p>One such project is a shelter for male migrant workers who are pursuing legal action concerning their employment and are thus unable to work.</p><p>While North South Initiative does not get USAID funds directly, Pereira estimated that his NGO was granted USAID-funded projects worth between US$100,000 and US$150,000 last year.</p><p>\"Sadly, this scenario (of reduced foreign aid) has pushed us to a corner. In the next one or two days or even hours, I will have to make decisions - very painful decisions - regarding these shelters or safe homes,\" Pereira said.</p><p>Pereira said the lack of lead time before US foreign aid was pulled had caught many NGOs in Malaysia by surprise, noting that donors usually give advance notice of about six months to a year before exiting.</p><p>\"I think a lot of NGOs will be in trouble ... What is worrying is the (impact on) vulnerable communities that we have been protecting for many years,\" he added, referring to grassroots beneficiaries like migrant workers and refugees.</p><p>\"What happens to them when organisations have to shut down their shelters? What happens to them when medical aid is cut?\" Arlina Ghani, co-founder of Justice for Wildlife Malaysia, a wildlife conservation group focused on building legal capabilities, told CNA that the US foreign aid cuts have forced her partners to suspend three projects.</p><p>These projects involve capacity building for wildlife law enforcement officers in Sabah and peninsular Malaysia, as well as adding more wildlife case trackers across the country.</p><p>The US Department of State, which funded these projects, issued the NGOs a stop-work order in January, Arlina said, effectively suspending all grants for 90 days pending a review.</p><p>This meant Arlina had to break the news to colleagues who had been freshly hired under these projects, including one who had moved back to Kota Kinabalu in Sabah from Kuala Lumpur for the new role.</p><p>\"Now I have to tell them, 'Look, guys, you might not be getting your salaries for three months. The projects might be cancelled, so you might have to look for other jobs.' That's the most difficult bit,\" she said.</p><p>The plan now, Arlina said, is to look for alternative sources of funding, including starting a formal crowdfunding programme.</p><p>\"We also plan to reach out to companies, the corporate sector mostly, and we are also thinking of getting law firms to assist with the funding as well,\" she said.</p><p>\"So right now, it's just a matter of ironing out the details in terms of, okay, if they fund us, how do we deal with the conflict of interest.\" Both Arlina and Pereira acknowledged that some causes are not as appealing as others when it comes to getting funding from brands, companies or politicians.</p><p>For instance, human trafficking is typically \"not so attractive, or doesn't give the PR image that a lot of donors are looking for\" compared to, say, sustainability, Pereira said.</p><p>Pereira hopes the US reverses its suspension of foreign aid, warning that it could \"backfire\" on the country's crucial supply chains if there are not enough labour rights groups safeguarding migrant workers' welfare.</p><p>\"It's not that we are over-dependent (on US aid); it's just the nature of how the development world works,\" he said, calling on Asian and African governments to fill the gap by funding their own civil societies.</p><p>HOW FOREIGN AID COULD CHANGE</p><p>Pereira and other experts say reforms are needed in the international humanitarian aid system for it to function sustainably in the future.</p><p>At the moment, most foreign aid is \"sucked up\" by United Nations (UN) organisations and regional NGOs, with little trickling down to smaller counterparts on the ground, Pereira highlighted.</p><p>The existing system has far too much wastage and too little money reaching small civil society groups, added Rosalia Sciortino, the founder and director of SEA Junction.</p><p>\"We need to recognise that there was a need to give more to local societies and local organisations,\" she told the panel event in Bangkok.</p><p>\"And all of us as civil society, we need to learn about saving and we need to learn about reducing waste in our spending. So it's not only the money we get but how we use the money, ensuring it's used for the sustainability of our organisation.\"</p><p>John Luke Chua, part of the USAID-funded Asia Counter Trafficking in Persons project, said reform would be difficult in an environment of blanket cuts.</p><p>\"I've heard calls for localisation, more flexible funding and stronger support for grassroots. Instead of that, what we have right now is a sharp rightward turn that prioritises political expediency over evidence-based impact,\" he told the panel.</p><p>\"Funding decisions are no longer driven by whether programmes actually achieve what they set out to achieve, but by whether or not they align with short-term political calculus.\"</p><p>Sara Piazzano, an independent consultant and project manager, noted greater shifts happening as governments worldwide increasingly reduce their foreign aid budgets and are more willing to offer concessional loans instead.</p><p>These types of loans, which reached record highs in value globally in 2023, are usually low- or zero-interest and can be funnelled from governments through specialised programmes and partnerships with international institutions, including multilateral banks.</p><p>\"Japan is doing that. They shifted almost all the development aid there. China, of course, has always used this approach. Maybe this is the future that we are going to see,\" Piazzano said, highlighting that major recipients in Asia include Indonesia, Vietnam and India.</p><p>\"I was thinking Bangladesh would have a big impact, not having USAID.

Its funding heavily relied on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is responsible for administering the country's civilian foreign aid and development assistance. Weeks after the funding tap was turned off, the Manushya Foundation has seen some of its most critical functions halted or scaled back. Most at risk are the activists across Asia that the organisation helps keep safe, a function that is mostly hidden from public view, she explained. The foundation supports environmental defenders, climate justice groups, indigenous peoples groups and political activists \"being targeted\", typically by governments, across the region including most of Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Mongolia. We have nine safe houses in Bangkok where we can hide families and activists that come to hide in Thailand, hoping to be resettled to a third country and we also provide a lot of rapid response grants,\" she said. Many activists can find themselves in imminent danger and need assistance at short notice, she explained. \"(The public doesn't) know that we are protecting activists, hiding them, providing grants, because that's the work that we didn't want to be that visible to be able to do it well. Manushya Foundation, according to Pradichit, saw its 2025 funds worth US$560,000 for such projects disappear.

A look at recent US Pacific Islands policies might provide some clues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES</p><p>The Biden administration released its Indo-Pacific Strategy in February 2022, the framework for countering Chinese influence, maintaining America's traditional strategic dominance, and signalling its desire to play a greater role in the region. One tool was to strengthen overlapping minilateral alliances, such as AUKUS and the Quad. Others were newly created, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).</p><p>After the shock of the China-Solomon Islands security deal in May 2022, the Biden administration increased its diplomatic and economic engagement with Pacific Island countries. President Joe Biden twice hosted Pacific Island Forum (PIF) leaders at the White House for US-Pacific Summits in 2022 and 2023. The US also announced the US-Pacific Partnership Strategy, a roadmap for strengthening cooperation.</p><p>Over the past four years, there have been an unusual number of high-level political visits to Pacific Island countries, including visits by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was in Fiji in early December. The Biden administration also increased its diplomatic presence, opening embassies in Tonga, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, and a US Agency for International Development (USAID) office in Fiji.</p><p>After aid cuts in the years before, Biden announced a US$810 million aid package over 10 years, including US$130 million for climate change projects. This funding still has not received full congressional approval and its future under Trump 2.0 remains unclear.</p><p>In March, Biden renewed the Compact of Freely Associated States (COFA), announcing an unprecedented package of US$7 billion over 20 years for the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. The US has a long-standing special relationship with these three strategic countries in the Western Pacific, which receive the lion's share of US Pacific aid and investment. COFA will continue to allow the US to provide defence, deploy forces and operate bases there. CLOSE ALLY AUSTRALIA ASSISTING</p><p>America's ally, Australia, has also been doing the heavy lifting in the South Pacific. Already the biggest aid donor to the Pacific Islands countries, Australia has further increased assistance in the last two years.</p><p>To counter China's influence with its neighbours, Australia has concluded several security and aid deals, among them the recent security agreement with Tuvalu which gives Australia a veto power in Tuvalu's foreign and security affairs.</p><p>In December, Australia concluded a rather controversial agreement with Nauru which gives it veto power of pacts that Nauru might want to conclude with third countries. The five-year deal continues to secure Australia's detention facility for Australia-bound refugees and comes with a A$140 million budget (US$87 million) and police support for Nauru.</p><p>The Australia-Solomon Islands security arrangement, announced recently on Dec 20, will fund A$190 million into the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force and set up a new police training centre in the capital Honiara. This deal is a major achievement of the Labour-led Albanese government to counter the China-Solomon Islands security agreement. THE SECOND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: WHAT TO EXPECT?</p><p>Trump is likely to focus primarily on the security aspects.</p><p>Fiji and Papua New Guinea had become the main beneficiaries of the Biden administration's strategy over the past two years, with landmark defence and security agreements.</p><p>Increased economic ties between Papua New Guinea and China will loom large over any potential US disengagement or trade sanctions. The Trump administration can be expected to honour previous agreements, so as not to create loopholes for potential Chinese security-related engagement.</p><p>But the new administration must also be mindful of the growing discontent over the use of the Pacific as a strategic theatre for the US and China.</p><p>Pacific Island leaders have voiced concerns about ongoing intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing in the Pacific, complaining about an American ICBM test in November that flew over the Marshall Islands and a Chinese ICBM test in the South Pacific in September.</p><p>PIF Secretary General Baron Waqa recently said: \"Geopolitical manoeuvring mean nothing to Pacific peoples who have cyclones on the horizon [and] are focused on building resilience, peace and prosperity for our families, communities and nations.\" The three COFA nations may also come into focus again. Trump's first administration regarded the ability to use US military installations in these three island nations as an important part of his Indo-Pacific strategy. He hosted the leaders of the three countries at the White House in May 2019. This view of their \"usefulness\" to the US is likely to prevail.</p><p>However, a longstanding practice has been to allow citizens of the three COFA states to live and work in the United States and access federal benefits like food stamps and healthcare. This may be at odds with the proclaimed immigration agenda of the second Trump administration. A partial US revision of the COFA articles is unlikely to be acceptable to the three partner countries.</p><p>There is a strong possibility that the second Trump Administration will leave Biden's 14-member economic initiative IPEF. Fiji, being the only Pacific Islands member, will probably search for alternative trade agreements. CLIMATE ACTION THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE</p><p>The biggest obstacle to the relationship between the US and Pacific Island countries will be climate change, as their positions are diametrically opposed.</p><p>Trump is expected to withdraw from the Paris Agreement a second time and focus US energy policy on oil and gas.</p><p>Pacific Island countries have become leaders in the global fight against climate change, such as in two United Nations groups - the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).</p><p>Tuvalu's prime minister has called on major polluters to make concrete commitments to phase out fossil fuel production. Current policies - leading to new coal, oil and gas projects - are a \"death sentence\", he insisted.</p><p>Samoa rallied UN member states to press for more progress on \"loss and damage finance\". And it was Vanuatu that brought about a landmark UN resolution, backed by 130 countries, on climate justice and countries' obligations to address climate change.</p><p>Under the second Trump administration, there will be difficult discussions at the UN between AOSIS, SIDS and the US. Expect also the Biden climate change package for Pacific Island countries to be reduced or scrapped. PRAGMATIC COOPERATION FOR A LOUDER VOICE</p><p>The second Trump administration will have to take into account that Pacific Island countries have become more pragmatic and have more options than in the past. Geopolitical wrangling has also meant that other donors, both governmental and non-governmental, are willing to step in.</p><p>PIF countries have shown that they can overcome some of their internal regional divisions, coordinate their positions and work with like-minded countries outside the Pacific. This pragmatic \"New Pacific Diplomacy\" has strengthened their climate voice in UN negotiations.</p><p>The geopolitical power competition has provided Pacific Island leaders the opportunity to leverage their unique position to advance some of their most pressing issues, climate emergency and infrastructure investment.</p><p>No doubt, they will use it in the next four years.

And it was Vanuatu that brought about a landmark UN resolution, backed by 130 countries, on climate justice and countries' obligations to address climate change. Under the second Trump administration, there will be difficult discussions at the UN between AOSIS, SIDS and the US. Expect also the Biden climate change package for Pacific Island countries to be reduced or scrapped. PRAGMATIC COOPERATION FOR A LOUDER VOICEThe second Trump administration will have to take into account that Pacific Island countries have become more pragmatic and have more options than in the past. Geopolitical wrangling has also meant that other donors, both governmental and non-governmental, are willing to step in.

Their unwavering commitment to safeguarding lives and promoting the well-being of women and newborns is nothing short of heroic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indispensable in routine healthcare, midwives are evermore important during emergencies.</p><p>Amidst increasingly frequent natural disasters across Asia and the Pacific, midwives stand as lifelines, ensuring safe childbirth and maternal well-being for millions of women. In the face of adversity, they ensure health services are more accessible and can quickly reach women in need. In low resource settings, midwives as frontline workers often serve as the only source of help for a woman to give birth safely.</p><p>Consider the story of Shakila, a midwife serving in a remote village in Bangladesh prone to major flooding. Despite the looming threat of disasters, Shakila remains steadfast in her mission to help mothers and babies in her community. When non-stop rain caused flooding in her village, the maternity ward, pharmacy, and storage room were submerged by water. She still continued to deliver babies, without electricity, even supporting emergency cesarean sections as needed with the doctors on call. During disasters, Shakila is a beacon of hope, offering critical assistance to women in labor despite the chaos and destruction. Through her resilience and resourcefulness, she embodies the spirit of midwifery, serving in the most challenging of circumstances.</p><p>Wading through water or the rubble of earthquakes, midwives save lives. Standing by the side of a woman before, during, and after childbirth, midwives offer critical support and provide life-saving care during complicated deliveries. They can help prevent fistula by identifying and managing prolonged or obstructed labor promptly, and promoting timely access to emergency obstetric care when needed. Midwives also provide essential sexual and reproductive health services and information, including family planning, and often serve as the sole healthcare provider for women and girls in hard-to-reach communities. In fact, in any given setting, skilled midwives can provide 90 per cent of all essential sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn health services.</p><p>Recognising the lifesaving role of midwives is not just a moral imperative; research suggests that facilitating universal access to midwives is a strategic investment that represents the most effective and cost-efficient solution to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths.</p><p>Yet, there is a global shortage of close to 1 million midwives, including a shortage of 200,000 midwives in the Asia and Pacific region - a reflection of the systemic undervaluation of their critical role in healthcare.</p><p>With 66,000 women dying in pregnancy or childbirth every year across Asia and the Pacific, the need for more trained and qualified midwives is crucial. By closing the deficit in the number of midwives, the world could prevent two thirds of maternal and newborn deaths, saving millions of lives, especially in the face of climate disasters.</p><p>The evidence is clear. Investing in midwifery is not just a matter of healthcare; it is a cornerstone of climate and disaster adaptation and resilience. By strengthening midwifery education, training, and support systems, governments and stakeholders can bolster the resilience of communities facing the impacts of climate change. Equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate emergencies, midwives can ensure continuity of care even in the most challenging of circumstances, saving lives and mitigating the impact of disasters on maternal and newborn health.</p><p>Midwives also serve as advocates for climate justice, highlighting the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on women and girls. By amplifying the voices of midwives, we can advance gender-responsive approaches to climate adaptation and resilience, ensuring that the needs and rights of women are central to our efforts to build a sustainable future.</p><p>As we confront the realities of a changing climate, let us pay tribute to the pivotal role of midwives in safeguarding the health and well-being of communities across Asia and the Pacific, and beyond.

The evidence is clear. Investing in midwifery is not just a matter of healthcare; it is a cornerstone of climate and disaster adaptation and resilience. By strengthening midwifery education, training, and support systems, governments and stakeholders can bolster the resilience of communities facing the impacts of climate change. Equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate emergencies, midwives can ensure continuity of care even in the most challenging of circumstances, saving lives and mitigating the impact of disasters on maternal and newborn health. Midwives also serve as advocates for climate justice, highlighting the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on women and girls. By amplifying the voices of midwives, we can advance gender-responsive approaches to climate adaptation and resilience, ensuring that the needs and rights of women are central to our efforts to build a sustainable future. As we confront the realities of a changing climate, let us pay tribute to the pivotal role of midwives in safeguarding the health and well-being of communities across Asia and the Pacific, and beyond. On this International Day of Midwives, we urge for increased recognition of their contribution to society and greater investments in their education, deployment and empowerment as we celebrate their achievements.

These targets, announced in 2022, are slightly higher than its earlier Paris Agreement pledge.</p><p>Indonesia has also pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 or earlier, which means it will absorb as much carbon as it emits. It plans to do so by retiring all its coal-fired power plants by 2050 and deploying more clean energy sources like solar farms and wind turbines. The country - Southeast Asia's largest economy and the world's largest coal exporter - currently derives 57 per cent of its energy from coal, which is the dirtiest fossil fuel. Indonesia's energy sector emitted 600 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide in 2021.</p><p>How Mr Widodo's successor continues to steer Indonesia's energy transition will have a far-reaching impact.</p><p>REACHING NET-ZERO</p><p>All three candidates - former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, defence minister Prabowo Subianto and former Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowo - have said they will remain committed to the goals set by Jokowi if they become Indonesia's next president. However, their plans to achieve these goals differ.</p><p>Mr Anies and his vice-presidential running mate Muhaimin Iskandar plan to closely monitor the carbon emitted by factories, smelters and power plants. They have pledged to retire coal power plants, especially those in Java and Bali, early.</p><p>Although they have promised to increase the share of renewables in Indonesia's energy mix, they have not specified a target. Indonesia's current goal is for renewables to make up 23 per cent of its electricity mix by 2025, up from 14 per cent in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p>They have also promised incentives to encourage communities to participate in clean electricity generation, which could be on-grid or off-grid.</p><p>Their two rival teams have also announced net-zero targets.</p><p>In addition, Mr Ganjar Pranowo and his vice-presidential pick, Mr Mahfud MD, have set a target for renewables in Indonesia's energy mix - 30 per cent by 2029. The Ganjar-Mahfud plan to achieve this involves thousands of \"energy self-reliant villages\" across Indonesia. These villages will generate their electricity solely or partially from the sources available in their regions, which could range from geothermal and solar, to natural gas and hydropower.</p><p>Although some climate activists agree with a focus on community-based clean energy programmes over large-scale projects, Mr Leonard said the Ganjar-Mahfud team's \"energy self-reliant villages\" plan is, in itself, not enough to get Indonesia to net-zero.</p><p>\"The big consumers of electricity are in the big cities,\" he said. \"We need a more ambitious strategy because we are heading to a climate catastrophe.\" SOVEREIGNTY THE FOCUS FOR PRABOWO-GIBRAN</p><p>Mr Prabowo Subianto and his running mate, Mr Gibran Rakabuming Raka, have affirmed climate targets made under Jokowi's administration, including early retirement of coal power plants.</p><p>The pair's climate and environment proposals are generally focused on Indonesia's sovereignty, such as self-sufficiency in energy, food and water. They believe Indonesia has the potential to become the world's \"superpower\" in biofuels and renewable energy.</p><p>\"By increasing our biofuel production, we can reduce (oil) imports, increase the production of our palm oil and it is more environmentally friendly,\" Mr Gibran said on Jan 21 during a vice-presidential debate on environment, energy and food security.</p><p>The pair also want to promote the use of bioplastics, which are made from biomass sources like vegetable oils and fats. Bioplastics have been touted as an eco-friendly substitute for plastic, but experts caution they are not a real solution as they can be composted only in carefully controlled conditions. If bioplastics end up in landfills, they could cause environmental harm, as plastics do. Boosting Indonesia's biofuel production could also mean more deforestation, benefiting big palm oil companies at the expense of the environment, noted Mr Anggi Putra Prayoga, a campaign manager at Forest Watch Indonesia.</p><p>\"(The plan) will harm Indonesia's natural forests,\" Mr Anggi told CNA. Indonesia produced 18.4 million tonnes of palm oil in 2022, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI), 47 per cent of which was used to produce biodiesel.</p><p>Meanwhile, Indonesia's fuel consumption was 69.7 million tonnes in 2022, which means millions of hectares of forests would have to be converted into oil palm plantations if the country wishes to boost its biofuel output.</p><p>The country is already the world's largest producer of palm oil and, according to the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, has 16.8 million hectares of land used for oil palm cultivation.</p><p>Although there has been a downward trend in deforestation since 2018, Indonesia is still losing about 100,000 ha of forest and peatland a year, GreenpeaceIndonesia recently noted. Indonesia has the world's third-largest area of rainforest, after the Amazon and Africa's Congo Basin, which is home to many threatened plants and animals.</p><p>The current government's plan is for Indonesia's forestry sector to be a carbon sink absorbing more carbon than it releases by 2030. But in an analysis released in December, GreenpeaceIndonesia found that in areas already allocated for industrial uses, tens of millions of hectares of natural forest are at risk because of the lack of strict regulations to protect them.

Ethnic cleansing, collective punishment, apartheid, sexual violence as a tool of state terror, and the deliberate targeting of health-care facilities and workers are part of multiple ongoing conflicts in 2023. The unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, civil conflicts underway in Tigray in Ethiopia, Sudan, Myanmar, and Syria, the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the Saudi- led coalition's bombardment of Yemen, all have in common violations of the rules of conduct in war-specifically, attacks on civilians, health-care workers, health-care facilities, and infrastructure and other violations of medical neutrality. These attacks are also violations of the right to health; through the denial of health-care access, they undermine the principle of dignity and the equal value of all human lives.</p><p>Armed conflict is an extreme domain of human rights abuses, but is only one of many settings in which human rights violations are taking place. Other concerns that undermine the right to health include the deliberate degradation of our environments and the climate for short-term profit and the widespread use of disinformation and misinformation that adversely affects people's rights to benefit from scientific progress. Disinformation related to the safety and efficacy of vaccines has led to multiple disease outbreaks and to losses of life during the Covid-19 pandemic. Political and legal attacks on the rights of sexual and gender minorities, and on the rights of women, undermine the universality of human rights and are occurring in countries as diverse as Iran, Russia, Uganda, and the USA. Indeed, in his opening address to the 53rd Council of the UN Human Rights Council in June, 2023, Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, reaffirmed the centrality of the UDHR for our deeply troubled times precisely because of its core principle of universality.</p><p>The global community backs away from the universality of human rights at its collective peril. In 1948, the UDHR was crafted in the wake of the Nazi persecutions of Jewish people, Roma, LGBT persons, individuals with disabilities, and others deemed unfit to live by the Nazi regime.6 The relevance of the UDHR was also clear in the decades that followed World War 2, notably in the struggle against the avowedly racist apartheid regime in South Africa, which was also a struggle to realise universal rights. Equality for all must be upheld as a guiding principle for all our societies. The responsibility to protect rights cannot be left to our current political systems and human rights bodies, including the UN, because they are manifestly failing to do so in many places.</p><p>How relevant, then, is the human rights framework to health in these troubled times? How can the global health community press for universal health coverage, committed to by heads of states at the 79th Session of the UN General Assembly in September, 2023, when we see so many millions of people denied the most basic health services, including the substantial numbers of internally displaced people and refugees? And what are the possible roles and potential actions health-care workers can undertake to address these threats?</p><p>First, the tools of population-based sciences need to be used more intensively and routinely to document and measure human rights abuses; this information can be used to hold governments and other actors to account. These tools, exemplified by the use of novel satellite technologies and video surveillance in the documentation of Russian atrocities in Bakhmut and other cities in Ukraine, hold great promise for accountability for war crimes. Second, health-care workers must put human rights at the forefront of our work and become much more engaged in efforts to protect the rights of those we seek to serve. This is a pressing reality for many obstetric care providers in US states, for example, where multiple restrictions on reproductive and sexual health and rights have adversely affected the practice of medicine, endangered patients' lives, and put health-care providers in legal jeopardy for providing essential care.Third, medicine and health care must be a more active participant in advocacy for health-care access as a human right in all societies. No one should be denied health-care access by virtue of legal or immigration status-yet multiple health systems do just this, and providers must not be complicit in these denials of access to care. Fourth, common cause is needed with those advocating for inter-related rights, including the movement for addressing the climate crisis and for climate justice, anti-racist struggles, the LGBTQ+ rights movement, and the global movement for women's rights to bodily autonomy, choice, and freedom from sexual and gender-based violence, among others. Health- care workers have agency in these struggles and need to influence these social and political debates. Health-care workers cannot stay in our professional domains and expect others to address these crises.</p><p>To address the rising tide of human rights violations and their many and varied impacts on health, the International AIDS Society and The Lancet convened a multidisciplinary Commission on health and human rights in 2019.11 The Commission's report is expected to be released in early 2024. This report will aim to explore multiple domains of health and rights and will argue for a reinvigoration of the UDHR as a basis for protecting health in the 21st century.</p><p>Human rights protections are not optional, and they are not reserved for the fortunate few who are citizens of countries that now enjoy peace and prosperity. If we consider the climate crisis alone, our collective rights to enjoy a liveable and healthy environment are under existential threat. Young people worldwide know that their survival is at stake, and many have been organising and winning court cases based on their right to a liveable future. For those living under repressive regimes and trying to survive in the world's expanding zones of conflict and displacement, human rights have proven stubbornly cherished hopes for a better future.

Such mainstream thinking on climate change is most reflective of the perspective of the elite and corporations of the Global North. Developing countries of the Global South mistaking these solutions for their principal climate action may find themselves unprepared to face climate vulnerabilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change might seem like a purely technical and scientific issue of reducing pollutants - greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide - that are presenting a threat to the environment and human life via global warming. Climate action often focuses on shifting our energy sources from fossil fuels to lower-impact alternatives such as renewable energies, and halting the loss of forests and other carbon sinks that absorb carbon dioxide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In reality, climate change is more complex. Rising global average temperatures are already causing extreme weather events such as floods, heat waves, droughts, and wildfires. These cause damage and loss to lives, livelihoods and property. Melting glaciers and sea ice lead to coastal erosion, sea level rise, storm surges, and breakdown of ocean circulation systems. Alongside efforts to stabilise the climate many communities will have to adapt to the climate changes that are already happening and will continue to happen for some time to come.</p><p>There is a third dimension of climate action that goes beyond physical causes and effects. Climate justice tackles the ethical and political distribution of responsibility for the climate crisis. Not all countries are equally responsible for causing climate change. But people who are genuinely concerned about the climate crisis sometimes assume Malaysia shoulders an equal burden to developed countries. Policies and climate action proposed based on this assumption risk being unjust if they lead to disproportionate burdens or fail to address our direct climate vulnerabilities.</p><p>Historical emissions matter because carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for thousands of years. Massive long-term emitters have the greatest impact on our climate. Just six nations are responsible for over 70 per cent of historical global greenhouse gas emissions. In descending order of magnitude these are the United States, the European Union, China, Russia, the UK, and Japan. Emission proportions are skewed even more to the North when we take into account China's huge population of nearly 1.4 billion, more than the other five combined. What share of global emissions is Malaysia responsible for? A mere 0.37 per cent as of 2020.</p><p>Under the United Nations' treaties, a country's responsibility and ability to address climate change is proportional to its emissions, technological and financial capability. Rapid big cuts by big emitters will stabilise the global climate more then big cuts by small emitters. Because the climate changes we are experiencing are primarily driven by global factors we need to cut emissions on a global scale in order to save Malaysia at the local level. Drastic cuts in Malaysia's own emissions will not be enough to move the needle because our emissions are comparatively small. Global factors complicate assumptions that cutting domestic emissions leads to direct reductions in domestic climate vulnerabilities.</p><p>If we want to save Malaysia from the ravages of climate change we need to link science to action that is appropriate to our circumstances.</p><p>The electric vehicle transition features prominently in Western media. Displacing Malaysia's dependence on single-occupancy fossil-fuelled cars in favour of greater public transportation and electric vehicles where appropriate would be an environmental good. But it will not stop the seas from rising, floods from worsening, and heatwaves bedevilling us because Malaysian emissions are comparatively low.</p><p>Shifting our electricity fuel mix rapidly away from coal towards renewables is environmentally desirable, but how do we ensure rising costs of electricity production don't punish the vast majority of households who are struggling with low wages, inflation, and pandemic recovery?</p><p>Mass deployment of electric vehicles, renewable energies, costly carbon capture and sequestration - the kind of solutions proposed to deliver deep cuts in the biggest polluting countries - are they appropriate for the likes of Malaysia, Egypt, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and North Korea?</p><p>I mention the last five countries because they have emitted a comparable amount to Malaysia, though our development results have been considerably greater when considered in terms of gross national income. Malaysia's development gains have been relatively emissions efficient by comparison. Yet, we do not have anywhere near the same technological and financial capability as the 'Big Six' polluters who are also Great Powers of world diplomacy.</p><p>We need diplomatic pressure on the biggest global polluters to undertake deep cuts that will save all of us. Malaysia can't exert enough diplomatic pressure on its own, so we need to work en bloc with a critical mass of developing countries. This is a role from which Malaysia has exercised leadership in the past.</p><p>Nationally and locally, we should be focusing on climate adaptation measures: urban greening to tackle urban heatwaves, flood mitigation and better planning to minimise the impact of the great rains, mangrove restoration and engineering works to combat coastal erosion. These measures are not rocket science, we have the local expertise and technology to pull much of this off, unlike with energy transition measures. However, we need to tap into more national and international financing to bring these solutions online. It can be done. Think City in Penang has recently secured US$10 million (RM44 million) in climate adaptation financing to tackle heat and floods.</p><p>We must also conserve and expand our precious forests and coral ecosystems because the carbon they absorb allows the rest of our economy and society to keep down net emissions from using currently available energy resources - as much as 76 per cent in 2016. Selling the rights to these as carbon credits to international buyers effectively cedes our strategic development reserve to richer countries who should be cutting emissions at source with their technology and finance, not with our forests. Sustainably financing ecosystem conservation is a critical and neglected element in preserving our development policy space for future generations of Malaysians.</p><p>This is a month of national history where we look back into the past for inspiration. In order to prepare for the future we must recognise what is useful and appropriate for our national journey. In order to tackle the climate crisis we do need to cut emissions and respond to current and emerging impacts. But the biggest cuts in emissions need to happen outside of Malaysia - from the Big Six Great Polluters - and no one but ourselves will protect our communities and nature from the ravages of climate change. We will protect them best by pursuing climate justice internationally and upscaling adaptation measures locally.

The group successfully argued that the state had violated the constitution and that climate change had played a role in harming their health, recreation and traditions.</p><p>It means that the state must now consider climate change when permitting energy projects, which could set a new legal precedent. \"I think we're really going to see a boom of cases,\" Dr Tigre said.A CONTENTIOUS PROPOSITION</p><p>The UN general comment supports a developing trend of growth in climate lawsuits around the world, especially in the Global South - a term used to group poor or least developed countries including many in the Southeast Asia region.</p><p>Globally, the number of climate change-linked legal cases has soared to 2,180 in 2022, up from 885 in 2017, according to data from the Sabin Center and the United Nations Environment Programme.</p><p>In China, the country's highest court in February issued a guidance that would encourage prosecutors to bring forward climate cases to pressure companies to follow environmental laws and help the nation reach its decarbonisation targets.</p><p>Despite this green light for the court to hear cases on a range of environmental matters, China - and most of the Asia region generally - is still lagging in bringing forward climate litigation.</p><p>Of the cases recorded across the world between 2017 and 2022, only a tiny fraction - 6.6 per cent - have originated in Asia, the highest in the region being 12 cases in Indonesia.</p><p>Last year, a high-profile case in the Philippines saw the country's Commission on Human Rights find that fossil fuel companies were accountable for climate damage.</p><p>It means that those companies - which the commission found knowingly contributed to climate change, \"a direct threat to the right to exist\" - could be found legally liable for climate disasters in the country.</p><p>While the Commission's decision is also not legally binding, it could set future civil liability in any action for loss and damage arising from climate change.</p><p>It was a rare success in what remains a sparse area of focus for law firms in the region.</p><p>Part of the reason could be a stigma - and lack of scientific data - that still hangs over climate change regionally. And for many governments, climate action and therefore litigation is seen as an impediment to economic development, experts say.</p><p>\"I think in Asia and Africa, mostly, the litigators prefer not to use that language of climate change specifically, because they feel like it might hurt their cases,\" Dr Tigre said.</p><p>Indeed, experts agree that launching climate litigation in Southeast Asia remains a contentious and problematic proposition for anyone, let alone children, to undertake.</p><p>\"What we're seeing now, is a lot of interest in trying to explore various pathways to hold governments and corporations accountable. But my sense is that you won't get an explosion of litigation in Southeast Asia,\" said Associate Professor Jolene Lin from the Faculty of Law at National University of Singapore, who is also director of its Asia Pacific Centre for Environmental Law.</p><p>\"Southeast Asia is not a monolithic region; every single country is slightly different in its legal conditions and the situation and the political context in which litigation will unfold.</p><p>\"By and large, climate litigation is seen as unfriendly to governments who think that they are being challenged to do more and be accountable for their failure to do so.\"</p><p>Yet, while the UN statement is not legally binding, it could further inform legal systems, national legislation and corporate behaviour, when it comes to environmental protection and children's rights, say experts.</p><p>\"It is a very encouraging development, because it opens up an additional potential pathway to bolster litigants' claims,\" Assoc Prof Lin said.</p><p>\"When we talk about the development of climate change litigation, it's important to recognise the improvement, or the creation, of additional support, like a scaffolding process. This adds to the scaffolding,\" she said.</p><p>These rulings from international organisations may not have binding effect but they are an important source of legal guidance, she explained.</p><p>\"States generally don't want to be seen as pariahs. So, they will want to at least be seen to abide by these guidelines.\" GUARDED OPTIMISM</p><p>The Mekong region - including Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam - represents one of the tougher environments for environmental litigation.</p><p>The nature of governments - and often their strong influence over the court system - means that climate protest, let alone legal action, is risky.</p><p>Mr William Schulte, Mekong Region policy and legal advisor for EarthRights International, said that is one of the main reasons why there is \"basically zero climate litigation in the Mekong region right now\".</p><p>\"I think the only country in the region where theoretically it will be possible is Thailand,\" he said, citing the nature of the country's administrative court, which has made progressive rulings in the past on environmental issues.</p><p>\"The biggest challenge is just the political challenge. You could craft the most airtight legal system on paper, but if the political will is impaired to implement it, then nothing's going to happen.</p><p>\"And if you don't have an independent court system that actually has the authority to issue decisions that are followed by the government, then it's going to be impossible.\"</p><p>Despite this, Mr Schulte has \"guarded optimism\" that small successes in Indonesia, the Philippines and China could filter into the Mekong region. Incremental change could deliver the justice that many vulnerable communities are looking for.</p><p>Movement is happening on other fronts too. The ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights is in the process of developing a regional framework on environmental rights.</p><p>Yet at the same time, there is increasingly an appetite among young people and affected groups to seek legal recourse, especially when other methods of advocacy might have failed or are taking too long, according to Ms Virginia Benosa-Llorin, the co-leader of the Make Polluters Pay Project at Greenpeace Southeast Asia.</p><p>She said her extensive direct work with communities in the Philippines reveals their increased knowledge about the connection between climate change and their everyday living and economic situation.</p><p>The Philippines - one of the most climate-impacted countries on the planet - is a leading global voice in pushing for a working loss and damage mechanism, a system where traditional polluting nations would pay for the costs incurred by developing nations that did not cause the crisis.</p><p>Ms Benosa-Llorin said seeking reparations in court is another way to make polluters accountable.</p><p>\"The challenge actually is, which area of the law? What kind of case? And how are we going to file it?\" \"Just filing a case alone will not fly. It has to be coupled with campaigning, with advocacy work, with working with communities, to get the collective strength from the people who are impacted,\" she told CNA.NO 'SILVER BULLET'</p><p>Assoc Prof Lin said it would be too simplistic to suggest that the recent UN statement could confer any direct rights to individuals taking legal action or increase their chances of litigation success in this region.</p><p>Nor would litigation alone be able to solve the climate crisis for generations of young people.</p><p>\"Litigation is only one of several options. It shouldn't be seen as the silver bullet,\" she said.</p><p>She explained that there are limitations to relying on international legal instruments, like the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. One of the general rules of public international law is that domestic legal remedies must be exhausted before international mechanisms can be turned to.</p><p>\"For many litigants from Southeast Asia, exhaustion of domestic remedies is going to be challenging. It'll be an arduous process that will take years,\" she said. Bringing such a case to a Singapore court, for example, would have \"almost zero\" likelihood of success, she said, due to the cost and lack of relevant case law for public interest litigation.</p><p>One regional environmental law expert, who asked not to be identified due to ongoing legal work, said the global climate movement could shake up the behaviour of governments and large corporations, without cases necessarily going to court.</p><p>\"I think we can expect to see potentially more actions being brought by youth, but at the very least more awareness of a long-term view on climate and the environment, which actually transcends the issue of youth alone,\" she said.</p><p>She said the trend would \"hopefully\" emphasise the need for a purposeful approach to dealing with climate change, especially in the corporate sector, where there is a growing appreciation of the financial costs of environmental neglect or inaction.</p><p>\"Institutional investors are getting worried, companies are getting worried and company directors are really worried, because of the financial impacts.

They always did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the rain never let up. It washed out the fields in her village where cotton, sugarcane and rice plants grew. It surged into houses, the mosque, schools and the office where she worked.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So much rain fell that on one night in August, Madam Zeba and the villagers of Malook Khaskheli realised their homes had become too dangerous to stay in. All 130 households fled into the dark, bringing no more than scraps of food to feed themselves. Two months later in October, Malook Khaskheli, which lies in Pakistan's Sindh province, remained uninhabitable and accessible only by boat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its place was what appeared to be a lake, its horizon broken by transmission towers and flat, grey dwellings jutting out of the water. Wavy lines on the sides of buildings marked how high the floodwaters had risen.</p><p>Before fleeing, villagers had placed belongings that they hoped to retrieve on the higher levels of their houses. But these were washed away, too, and little was left to return to.</p><p>Among those who lost their homes in the floods was Afsha, 27, the wife of a soldier and mother to a four-year-old. Her family had lived in a house built by her grandparents in the village.</p><p>She was one of the luckier ones. After the disaster, she found work as a midwife, with a monthly income of 30,000 Pakistani rupees (US$135).</p><p>This lifted her above her village's average daily income of 500 Pakistani rupees, but was not enough to give her shelter. After fleeing Malook Khaskheli, her family had to seek refuge at a relief camp along a highway. More than 1,700 people have died and 33 million have been affected this year by Pakistan's floods, which have been linked to rising temperatures.</p><p>Climate scientists from the international World Weather Attribution group found that global warming led to rainfall over the Sindh and Balochistan provinces that was up to 75 per cent more intense, and caused a heatwave that preceded the floods to be 30 times more likely to occur.</p><p>The catastrophe provides a starkly real example of the concept of \"loss and damage\" - where climate impacts can no longer be avoided by simply reducing carbon emissions, and extend beyond the limits of adaptation measures.</p><p>Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman told CNA that the World Bank has estimated damages of about US$40 billion from the floods.</p><p>\"We believe the loss and damage to cost a lot more as this was an unprecedented flood event, bigger than 2010 and not experienced before in Pakistan's history,\" said Ms Rehman, referring to the country's last flooding calamity. The destructive events in Pakistan have also spurred calls for compensation from those most responsible for emissions - namely, developed countries.</p><p>Having them finance loss and damage is shaping up to be a key ask of developing countries at the United Nations climate summit COP27, which convenes in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from Sunday (Nov 6).</p><p>A decision on loss and damage will be a \"dealmaker or dealbreaker\" for COP27, said Sandeep Chamling Rai, senior adviser at the World Wildlife Fund.</p><p>\"It's a result of the moral obligation of the developed country whose economy has been built from the burning of fossil fuels,\" he added.</p><p>\"So it is their moral responsibility to address the climate crisis that they have created in the first place.\"</p><p>\"WE HAVE BEEN SET BACK 10 YEARS\"</p><p>Pakistan's breadbasket is in its central and southern regions, where the hardest-hit provinces of Sindh and Balochistan are. Across the country, more than 3.8 million ha of crops have been affected by the floods.</p><p>It only takes one missed harvest to risk trapping a farmer in a debt cycle. After water inundated Haider Ali's cotton fields, he could not repay the 53,000 Pakistani rupees he had borrowed to sow his crop.</p><p>Such loans were traditionally taken out before each sowing season, and repaid with proceeds from the harvest. With an annual interest rate of 18 per cent, Mr Ali, 50, said his remaining options were to lease his land to another farmer, sell his livestock or do labour on another farm. Mr Ali's neighbours in Majno Rind village described how their incomes have been slashed across a range of occupations, from rag-and-bone men to taxi drivers. Villagers usually worked as cotton-pickers in October, but there was no such employment after crops were killed.</p><p>Unusually high temperatures in Pakistan from early May had already caused crops to be planted outside their optimum timings, at higher cost and lower yield, said Dr Athar Hussain, head of the Centre for Climate Research and Development at Pakistan's COMSATS University Islamabad.</p><p>\"The untimely heavy rains resulted in destruction of crops that barely survived, thus causing further economic stress on Pakistan,\" he said.</p><p>With resources meant for development in other areas being diverted to flood victims, an economic slowdown at the national level would be the most dangerous long-term impact of the disaster, Dr Hussain warned.</p><p>Loss and damage covers loss of not just life, property or income, but also mobility, cultural heritage and biodiversity among others, pointing to the interconnected ways in which the climate influences every aspect of life. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that near-term actions to limit global warming to the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold laid out in the Paris Agreement would substantially reduce projected loss and damage.</p><p>But they cannot eliminate all of it. Instead, with more warming, more human and natural systems will reach their adaptation limits. And these climate impacts are \"strongly concentrated\" among the poorest vulnerable populations, said the panel.</p><p>This is because inequity and poverty lead to \"soft\" adaptation limits - the kind that could be overcome with more money or better technology.</p><p>Ms Rehman, the Pakistani minister, said her government expects about 15.4 million people to be pushed into \"hardscrabble poverty\".</p><p>Pakistan's government has repurposed parts of its budget, including climate adaptation and resilience funds, to compensate households affected by the floods, with more than US$301 million disbursed in immediate cash relief to more than 2.6 million people.</p><p>An area of up to 46,000 sq km - larger than Switzerland - remains inundated in southern Pakistan, said Ms Rehman.</p><p>\"We have been set back 10 years. Everything from infrastructure, schools, hospitals (to) people's very lives need rebuilding,\" she said. More than 13,000 km of roads and 400 bridges were destroyed across the country. Combined with damage to more than 1,400 health facilities, healthcare has been rendered \"completely inaccessible\" in Sindh and Balochistan, said Ms Rehman.</p><p>This could not have come at a worse time, with stagnant water from the floods driving an increase in water- and vector-borne illnesses like cholera, malaria and dengue.</p><p>Gynaecologist Dr Maira Yaqoob told CNA how the floods led to her delivering about 20 babies a day - up from seven to eight previously - at Tando Allahyar Civil Hospital, after other medical facilities were destroyed.</p><p>In October, the 27-year-old also served at a medical camp that moved around to reach pregnant women and new mothers who had lost access to healthcare in the floods.</p><p>Her patients complained of weakness, and suffered fevers and diarrhoea. She looked at sores on a mother's hands and a red, inflamed bump on her three-month-old baby's abdomen - skin infections from the filthy floodwaters.</p><p>The child lay lethargically on his mother's lap. He was malnourished, said Dr Yaqoob, who then referred him to the hospital where he could be fed. \"RICH COUNTRIES MUST STEP UP\"</p><p>In September, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asked at the UN: \"Why are my people paying the price of such high global warming through no fault of ours? We have no contribution in this.\"</p><p>At the heart of the debate over loss and damage is the tension between historical responsibility for climate change, and the disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations.</p><p>When countries signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, they noted that \"the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries\".</p><p>According to the IPCC, the least developed countries and small island developing states contributed less than 0.4 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively to historical CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry, between 1850 and 2019.</p><p>Pakistan itself reports a 0.9 per cent contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Experts told CNA that developed countries fear legal obligations to provide finance to climate-vulnerable countries. That has made loss and damage a politically charged issue.</p><p>\"It gets bogged down in terms of the developed countries seeing loss and damage as a compensation regime or reparations,\" said WWF's Mr Rai of the negotiations. As the first legally binding international treaty on climate change, the Paris Agreement enshrines the importance of addressing loss and damage. But it also explicitly states that it \"does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation\". These concerns remain on the flipside of discussions.</p><p>Another reason for stalled positions on loss and damage is slow progress in larger discussions on climate finance, said Melissa Low, research fellow at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions.</p><p>In 2009, developed countries pledged to mobilise US$100 billion a year by 2020, for climate action in developing countries. The target was missed and extended through 2025, and remains only partially met at US$83.3 billion in 2020.</p><p>Countries have the further task of hammering out, by 2025, a new collective quantified goal from a floor of US$100 billion a year.</p><p>\"The gap lies in the undertaking of responsibility by the rich countries to not only fulfil their pledges but also provide compensations for the carbon-intensive lifestyles and investments that continue to increase emissions,\" said Ms Rehman.</p><p>As the current chair of a bloc of more than 130 developing countries at the UN, Pakistan will seek, at COP27, \"concrete and structured decisions to build a formal mechanism to finance losses\", said Ms Rehman.</p><p>\"Loss and damage has to be put on the climate finance agenda formally. It has always been the stepchild of the larger discourse, but that needs to change now.</p><p>\"As for where the money will come from, let's get real. There are plenty of funds available globally, and for attracting that, combinations of sovereign and capital market debt can be raised.\" Ms Rehman said it was \"important to not add debt to national treasuries that are already mobilising all domestic revenue to finance international debt servicing\".</p><p>\"We don't want to rely on 'disaster aid' when the big emitters are holding back on their pledges,\" she added.</p><p>\"This crisis is not our doing. The rich countries must step up and create mechanisms for compensations as part of the long-awaited climate finance.\"</p><p>Ms Low, from NUS, pointed out that countries can also choose to take the lead outside the UN process.</p><p>Over the past year, Scotland and Denmark have made their own finance pledges to address loss and damage in developing countries, circumventing the lack of a global agreement.</p><p>\"I don't know if we should place all our hopes on loss and damage decisions being made at the COP or Paris Agreement level, because it will be too late for some countries ultimately. They can't wait,\" said Ms Low, who has attended the climate conference for more than a decade.</p><p>\"We talk about the COP all the time as being like the panacea or the silver bullet, but it really isn't.\" SINGAPORE \"TOO WELL-ADAPTED\"?</p><p>Southeast Asia has also been reckoning with the climate crisis.</p><p>In September, Super Typhoon Noru swept through the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, killing dozens of people. Malaysia experienced flooding described as being \"once in 100 years\" last December, and repeated floods have become a source of trauma for victims.</p><p>Super typhoons - which used to be rare but have become \"very familiar\" over the last two decades - and drought are among the major climate challenges facing the region, said Dr Albert Salamanca, senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute.</p><p>The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has estimated US$91 billion to US$127 billion in average annual losses from natural disasters in Southeast Asia, with up to 4.3 per cent of the region's GDP lost.</p><p>Hotspots of drought and related diseases are expected to intensify in Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam, with new risk hotspots emerging in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia in a worst-case scenario, according to the commission.</p><p>Dr Salamanca said climate change could also reverse development gains. The IPCC has observed reduced food and water security, adverse socioeconomic consequences from the widespread deterioration of ecosystems, and negative effects on physical and mental health.</p><p>Around Southeast Asia, many communities that suffer climate impacts are also \"remote from centres of power\" in capital cities, said Dr Salamanca.</p><p>Civil society organisations can play crucial roles in supporting them, such as by explaining the role of climate change in causing disasters as well as providing solidarity and relief and recovery assistance, he said. Amid all this, what is Singapore's place in the debate on loss and damage?</p><p>The country reports a contribution of about 0.11 per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions. It is considered a developing country, and therefore not among the developed countries mandated to provide climate finance in the Paris Agreement.</p><p>However, there are some who think that it's appropriate for that position to be looked at.</p><p>Local environment group SG Climate Rally told CNA: \"Singapore should acknowledge the role that fossil fuels have played in its development in the past and today.

The strategy marks a departure from past Democratic administrations that tended to run their climate strategies mainly through the Environmental Protection Agency. The interagency approach could help Biden make headway on global warming without having to rely on sweeping climate legislation that would be hard to pass in a divided Congress. \"Every agency is a climate agency now,\" said Sam Ricketts, co-founder of Evergreen Action, an advocacy group that advised Biden's transition team on climate change. </p><p>Here are how some federal agencies could likely to play a role in the administration's climate agenda: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY The EPA, as the nation's top environmental regulator, will be the obvious choice for Biden as his administration seeks to beef up climate protections and enforce regulations. The EPA could also rebuild rules and scientific processes that had been systematically dismantled by the administration of President Donald Trump. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT In charge of a fifth of the country's surface, the Interior Department will carry out Biden's campaign pledge that the United States will conserve nearly one-third of all land and water by 2030. Interior will also likely refocus its energy and minerals leasing programs toward clean energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal and away from the oil, gas, and coal that had been favoured by the Trump administration. Biden has promised to halt new oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters, a policy that will need to be led by Interior. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY The Energy Department will lead the charge on clean energy research and development programs, including advanced nuclear, fusion, battery and biofuel technology. Biden has said he intends to direct massive public investment into clean tech to ensure the country is able to eventually hit net-zero emissions by 2050. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT The Defense Department is the single largest buyer of fossil fuels in the federal government and can use its enormous procurement powers \"to purchase clean and resilient energy technologies, and advanced low-carbon fuels, that will enhance domestic resilience and simultaneously help to build the industries that will help defeat the existential climate threat,\" according to a memo from advocacy group Evergreen Action to the Biden transition team. TREASURY DEPARTMENT The Treasury Department could use the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act to require banks and other institutions to weigh climate risk in their investments, something that could trigger a big swing in private investment flows toward clean energy. Treasury could also create standards for federal overseas lending programs that could prohibit investment in high-carbon projects abroad. \"I think the Treasury Department is going to be a pretty big player on climate,\" said Christy Goldfuss, former White House Council on Environmental Quality under Obama who co-authored Climate 21, a roadmap for the Biden transition team to mobilise federal agencies to tackle climate change. AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Agriculture accounts for 9 per cent of US emissions but US forest land, much of which is overseen by the Agriculture Department, sequesters up to 15 per cent of annual fossil fuel emissions. The department could pay farmers, ranchers, and forest land owners to reduce and offset emissions through a credit program. It could also use crop insurance policies to encourage \"climate smart agriculture\", according to policy experts advising Biden. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT The Education Department could direct federal dollars toward funding of specialised teachers and programs to raise awareness of climate change and use its procurement powers to assist in the electrification of bus fleets and greening of school buildings. \"There could be also be lots of opportunities for new dollars for K-12 and higher education for technical education that prepares students for jobs in things like renewable energy, retrofitting buildings and electric cars and infrastructure,\" said John King Jr, education secretary under Obama. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT The Justice Department will have to defend the new administration's climate policies but could also prioritise federal civil cases with a climate focus, negotiate supplemental climate projects in settlements with polluters, and beef up enforcement actions against major companies, according to Kate Konschnik, a former environmental enforcement trial attorney for the DOJ.

It also gave them an avenue to continue producing content on a different platform without impacting their other personas or branded identities on other sites such as Instagram, Facebook or YouTube, said Dr Crystal.</p><p>Isolation during the pandemic also gave older, millennial influencers who were in their late 20s to late 30s the time to learn how to use TikTok and overcome the inertia of using another new app, she added.</p><p>But it was only when brands realised that TikTok had commercial value that the app truly went mainstream, said Dr Crystal, citing examples of how restaurants and alcohol brands turned to TikTok influencers to market their products and services during the pandemic.</p><p>Professor Lim Sun Sun from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) said that she expects TikTok's user base in Singapore to grow beyond its younger, teenage audience with non-entertainment personalities such as politicians starting to take TikTok more seriously as a platform for engagement.</p><p>In response to TODAY's queries, a TikTok spokesperson from Singapore said the platform \"continues to see strong growth in its audience reach and engagement\", with more than 1 billion people globally coming to TikTok every month. Nearly one out of four global users came from Southeast Asia, with its user base in the region exceeding 240 million, up by 85 per cent year-on-year.</p><p>The spokesperson said that \"it was only natural\" for online platforms such as TikTok to see an increase in user activity during the pandemic when more people stayed at home, with TikTok playing a part in \"connecting and meaningfully engaging communities even while physically apart\".</p><p>During the pandemic, TikTok saw a significant increase in daily accumulated engagement on videos as well as an uptick in video creation, especially content related to spreading positivity and educating people on hygiene practices.</p><p>\"We've also seen this increase in TikTok user activity continue even as restrictions eased in Singapore - leading to the platform surpassing 1 billion active global users monthly in September 2021,\" said the spokesperson.</p><p>LIVING OFF THE TIKTOK DREAM</p><p>As TikTok's popularity grows globally, so has its efforts to move beyond being a platform for trendy dance sequences - to one which promotes commerce.</p><p>To allow TikTokers to monetise their fame, the app has launched several features, including TikTok Creator Marketplace and TikTok Live in 2019.</p><p>In May this year, TikTok also introduced a subscription service for its TikTok Live where content creators can generate recurring revenue from fans through additional perks such as subscriber-only chats.</p><p>All seven TikTok creators whom TODAY interviewed said that they have made money from participating in brand sponsorships or publicising services on the platform.</p><p>Ms Liel, the 24-year-old TikToker, said that the rates for branded TikTok videos are usually in the range of thousands of dollars. Her highest-paid project on TikTok was a \"five-figure number\" while her least lucrative projects are usually in exchange for the products that she is promoting. While her monthly earnings are sometimes higher than that of a fresh graduate, Ms Liel acknowledged that what she does on TikTok cannot provide a stable income source.</p><p>\"I can be rolling in dough when big projects (involving large sums of money) come in one month, and then become a pauper the next month,\" she quipped.</p><p>To this end, Ms Liel said she has set up her own business - she runs several eyelash studio outlets - to ensure that she has something to fall back on if she becomes irrelevant and unable to make money on TikTok.</p><p>For Mr Ian Jeevan Prasad Arumugam, who is more popularly known as Ian Jeevan on TikTok, hitting 10,000 followers within a few months of his debut in April 2020 - during the \"circuit breaker\" period - was \"a big milestone\".</p><p>Mr Jeevan, who now has more than 150,000 followers on TikTok, earns between \"mid-four figures to low five figures\" for each project on the platform. The 26-year-old said that 80 per cent of his monthly income comes from social media content creation while the rest comes from his work as a financial consultant.</p><p>Another TikToker, dentist Tristan Peh, also started off by doing videos during the early part of the pandemic in March 2020 to bond with his young daughters, who were aged six and nine then.</p><p>Dr Peh, 43, who has gained more than 2 million followers through his videos on dental hygiene, said that he constantly gets emails from brands looking to do sponsored posts for toothbrushes or water flossers.</p><p>He began receiving requests for sponsored posts about four to five months after he started posting videos on TikTok.</p><p>He charges around US$5,000 (S$6,856) to US$10,000 for each post, based on his study of the market rates for such collaborations.</p><p>However, Dr Peh said that he is \"not really into sales\" and is mostly on TikTok to \"just have some fun, spread awareness (on dental hygiene) and get everyone to smile\". For some of these content creators, there is also the fear of losing their relevance in a space where the audience's taste is fickle and constantly evolving.</p><p>Ms Liel said: \"My worry is about whether I can start a family with a job that can be taken away (just) like that. It's (like) the whole world could collectively decide that they don't need you and I know that's imminent, because unless you create drama every day (on social media), you'll become irrelevant.\"</p><p>To stay relevant, Ms Liel has changed her content to keep up with her audience. While she started off with mostly comedy sketches, she now shares more about her life on TikTok to establish a connection and sense of community with her followers. Mr Jeevan, who is best known for Bollywood-style parodies on TikTok, said that he does not feel any financial pressure at the moment as he has a second job as a financial consultant, and brands are still actively seeking him out for collaborations.</p><p>To ensure that his TikTok content stays relevant, he said he has been branching out over the last two years, beyond the Bollywood skits.</p><p>He added that he has also sought to establish himself as a family-friendly content creator, one which brands find safe to collaborate with. This helps to ensure that brands continue to seek him out for campaigns, he said.</p><p>Still, he acknowledged the pressure from his fans or followers who want him to reproduce popular content that he has done before. But Mr Jeevan said that he does not want to do so unless he can be sure that the content is of good quality.</p><p>Meanwhile, other TikTokers said they do not see the need to chase \"likes\" or boost follower count because they feel financially secure with their day job.</p><p>One of them, Mr Hafidz Rahman, a 33-year-old arts educator, said: \"I do content when I want it and I'm quite comfortable doing it at my own pace. In terms of finding followers, I think they will come at their own time.\"</p><p>Mr Hafidz, who has been producing content on social media platforms since 2014, has 103,000 followers on TikTok and is known for playing the role of a Malay woman in comedy skits.</p><p>THE GOOD AND BAD OF TIKTOK</p><p>The TikTokers interviewed cited the ease of the app's video editing features and diverse reach as major draws for them.</p><p>Mr Cavin Chua Kar Shin, a 22-year-old university student who has been making videos on YouTube since primary school, said that TikTok allows anyone to build a following without needing to look good or have a following on other social media platforms first.</p><p>\"For YouTube, for instance, it takes very long to build a following, but you can do it really quickly on TikTok. Anyone can make a video and have it appear on the 'For You Page' at any time,\" he said.</p><p>The third-year communications and new media student at the National University of Singapore has more than 180,000 followers on his TikTok account cayydences. His posts range from comedy skits to anecdotes about his daily life.</p><p>Other upsides of the platform cited by the TikTokers include the sense of community it provides, and the opportunities to produce educational content or present minority views.</p><p>Mr Jeremy Tan, a 37-year-old magician who has more than 135,000 followers since joining TikTok last year, said: \"I realise that the community on TikTok, especially when I do livestreams, is really supportive and (they) care for the creators.\"</p><p>He recalled how when he was hospitalised recently for sleep apnea surgery and did not put up any posts, TikTok users messaged him to ask about his health and wish him well. Likewise, Mr Chua, who said he is an introvert with few friends, described TikTok as a \"substitute for his social life\", as his posts are similar to what he would share with a friend.</p><p>He has also spoken openly on TikTok about his struggle with depression and mental illness, and believes that this is one reason why users choose to follow him.</p><p>For others such as Ms Ainul Md Razib, a 24-year-old software developer, TikTok is not only a platform for her to share niche, educational content but also to inspire others as a member of a minority community in more ways than one.</p><p>She has built up a following of more than 40,000 by putting up TikTok tutorials on how to break into the tech industry.</p><p>\"I'm a Malay-Muslim woman working in the tech industry, and maybe people who see me on TikTok identify with me as a Malay, as a woman or as someone trying to break into the tech industry. They may not know anybody like that in real life, but they see me on social media and they follow because it inspires them,\" said Ms Ainul. Still, there are also drawbacks from being a TikTok personality, said those interviewed, with some lamenting the loss of their privacy.</p><p>Recalling how someone had interrupted his date for a photo request recently, Mr Chua said that he tries not to leave his house as far as possible and sticks to areas with fewer people to avoid being approached or recognised on the streets.</p><p>The TikTokers also cited hate comments as another hazard they have to face. As it is fairly easy to sign up for a TikTok account and remain anonymous on the platform, the problem is exacerbated on TikTok compared with other social media platforms, they said.</p><p>Ms Ainul said that she uses TikTok's filter feature to block out inappropriate words about her appearance or religion. These include words related to weight, vulgarities or Islamophobia.</p><p>Nevertheless, she noted that given the type of content she produces, the level of hate comments directed at her is still far lower compared with other TikTokers, including those with larger followings.</p><p>The TikTok spokesperson said that the company \"does not tolerate bullying on its platform\" and has developed several safeguards against it.</p><p>These include the removal of comments that go against TikTok's community guidelines, such as those which involve harassment or bullying, and hate speech.</p><p>TikTok has also partnered with digital safety organisations in Singapore such as the Media Literacy Council to launch campaigns that prompt users to think before they post or comment on videos. THE DOUBLE-EDGED IMPACT OF TIKTOK'S RISE</p><p>As with all other social media platforms, TikTok comes with the good, bad and ugly, said experts.</p><p>On the plus side, SUTD's Prof Lim highlighted how TikTok - with its ability to let anyone broadcast themselves - allows smaller, less visible communities, such as those with medical conditions, to band together.</p><p>It has also given regular folks with seemingly mundane lives an avenue to become famous, unlike influencers on other platforms such as Instagram, which is usually associated with glitz and glamour, said Prof Lim. She cited the example of how Mr Raymond Lim, better known as Uncle Raymond, rose to fame by broadcasting his dances outside MRT stations on TikTok.</p><p>Dr Crystal noted how TikTok became accepted as a mainstream application - and not just a platform for young people - when it was used in social justice movements.</p><p>For example, in Asia Pacific, TikTok was adopted as a means for the climate justice movement to organise marches in late 2019. It also became a site for young people to talk about anti-Asian racism when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in East Asia and Southeast Asia in early 2020, said Dr Crystal.</p><p>Some observers also pointed to how the Black Lives Movement in June 2020 tapped TikTok for social advocacy. During that period of protests, the #blacklivesmatter hashtag trended on TikTok and provided an avenue for users to share educational resources on the issue.</p><p>Despite its upsides, TikTok has also received its fair share of criticism.</p><p>NTU's Assistant Professor Saifuddin Ahmed noted that there have been more widespread discussions surrounding censorship, privacy and surveillance on TikTok compared with other social media platforms, although these issues are not necessarily specific to TikTok.</p><p>This is due to allegations of data mishandling and TikTok bowing to pressures from the Chinese government on how the data is used, he said.</p><p>Prof Lim also raised concerns about how TikTok's algorithm has been designed to keep users on the platform longer, generating the fear that its algorithm could draw users into harmful content such as reckless and risky acts, eating disorders or substance abuse.</p><p>However, Dr Crystal said that there are echo chambers on every social media platform, and echo chambers are worse in closed messaging groups such as WhatsApp or Telegram where there is no third party to vet or challenge the content.</p><p>She also argued that while TikTok's For You Page \"does groom and understand your preferences\", the app's users are \"more likely to chance upon content that's not connected to your egocentric profile, that's also not connected to your personal network of people you follow\".</p><p>This also means that in comparison, TikTok users \"end up being a pedestrian in more subcultures than you would in other social media\", she said.</p><p>TikTok said that its recommendation system, the For You feed, is central to the TikTok experience. Recommendations are based on several factors including user interactions, video information and device and account settings.</p><p>The spokesperson added that TikTok is aware that one of the \"inherent challenges\" of recommendation engines is that they can \"inadvertently limit (a user's) experience\", sometimes referred to as a filter bubble.</p><p>\"We recognise these concerns, and continue to strike a balance with optimising our For You feed for personalisation and relevance, while also helping users find fresh content and uncover new creators,\" said the spokesperson.</p><p>The spokesperson added that while safety is at the heart of the recommendation system, that did not mean that serious or controversial content did not have a place on the platform, which is ultimately built to support users' diverse thoughts, experiences and interests. \"THE MOST ADDICTIVE\" SOCIAL MEDIA APP</p><p>The success of TikTok's algorithm has led to it being dubbed the \"most addictive\" social media app. But its very strength is what could cause the most harm to users.</p><p>Mr John Shepherd Lim, chief well-being officer of Singapore Counselling Centre, said that the excessive use of TikTok is \"undoubtedly a common contributing factor\" to the mental health concerns that its young clients face today.</p><p>He noted that while TikTok can be a place for users to express their creativity, its mainly young and impressionable user base means that TikTok may have unintentionally created an environment where users feel the pressure to create videos to increase their follower count, views and \"likes\" in order to feel social validation.</p><p>Mindless consumption of content on TikTok can fuel self-esteem issues, body-image issues and life dissatisfaction, where users compare their own lives and relationships to what they see on the platform, he said.</p><p>\"If users find themselves ruminating or feeling more anxious regarding what they saw on TikTok, it might be time to put the phone down for a while,\" he added.</p><p>He also pointed out that with the presence of sexually provocative and various forms of controversial content available, youths are more susceptible to being exposed to adult content, perspectives and struggles at an earlier age.</p><p>TikTok's continuous supply of entertaining content and the \"rapid-fire nature\" of its videos train viewers' minds to quickly assess how pleasurable content is during the first few seconds. This may lead to a shortened attention span and a judgmental attitude that users can bring into other aspects of their lives, such as school or work, he noted. \"A litmus test for how affected our attention spans are, is to measure the length of time it takes for us to get impatient with less-pleasurable activities, such as homework,\" said Mr Lim.</p><p>\"If we seem to be performing other tasks at our normal capacity, our TikTok usage should not be a concern. Otherwise, users could consider setting a daily limit on TikTok screen time through the app's settings.\"</p><p>The TikTok spokesperson said it has options for users to manage the time spent on TikTok, including the daily limit feature which Mr Lim referred to.</p><p>The spokesperson reiterated that it is committed to protecting the safety of young users and has designed tools and strategies to prioritise age-appropriate experiences. These include community guidelines that prohibit nudity, pornography or sexually explicit content on TikTok.</p><p>The spokesperson said that TikTok also recognises that some content may contain mature or complex themes intended for older audiences. It is building a new system that will allocate maturity level to videos which will be rolled out in the coming months.</p><p>\"Our users' well-being remains our top priority and there is no end to our work on this front. As such, we are committed to actively developing and reinforcing our safety features to continue cultivating healthy digital practices and positive online experiences,\" said the spokesperson.</p><p>This story was originally published in TODAY.

Soon after his inauguration, Biden signed an executive action, among others, to begin rejoining the 2015 climate pact, reversing a decision by climate change sceptic Donald Trump. The process to re-enter the international accord takes a month, meaning the United States will only officially have been out of the deal for a short time, since exiting in November. READ: Biden puts US back into fight to slow global warming But Trump's hostility to the UN climate process and his support for polluting fossil fuels have left Biden's team a lot of catching up to do at home and abroad, policy analysts said. </p><p>\"Rejoining the Paris Agreement is really the floor, not the ceiling, for the Biden administration on climate,\" said Jennifer Morgan, CEO of Greenpeace International. If the US government then moves to help drum up more global ambition to curb rising temperatures, it must be done in a spirit of \"partnership and humility, not coming back in and telling everyone what they should be doing\", Morgan said. Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), said there would be a number of opportunities in 2021 for Biden to help advance \"a progressive climate agenda\" on the world stage. Those include the G7 and G20 leaders' summits, and the UN climate talks in November. READ: How Biden could use his whole government to take on climate change Biden and his international climate envoy John Kerry should also pursue meetings with other major emitters - as Biden has indicated he will do - \"to solidify ways to collectively tackle the climate crisis head-on\", she said in a statement. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who led the world body when the Paris deal was adopted, said he was \"delighted\" Biden had committed to bringing his country back into what Ban called \"the peace pact with the planet\". Trump's vow to leave it, first made in 2017, had acted like a \"cold shower\" for the global agreement, Ban told journalists. The US re-entry would \"help mobilise and resuscitate\" political will among global leaders, business and civil society to implement the accord faster, he added. 2030 TARGET One key task for Washington, after re-entering the Paris climate deal, will be to set a US emissions reduction target for 2030 and produce a stronger national climate action plan. Signatories to the Paris accord were meant to submit updated plans to cut emissions and adapt to worsening extreme weather and rising seas by the end of 2020 - but due to delays caused by the pandemic only about 70 have done so. The rest of the plans are expected to be delivered by the time of the postponed COP26 UN climate conference, set to be hosted by Britain in November. READ: Singapore welcomes US return to Paris Agreement on climate change: MFA The good news for Biden is that support for climate action is growing among the US electorate. A December survey of nearly 950 registered voters across the political spectrum found 75 per cent supported US participation in the Paris accord. In addition, 64 per cent said the United States should reduce planet-heating emissions regardless of what other countries do, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication found. Last week, the Rhodium Group of researchers and analysts said US greenhouse gas emissions fell 10.3 per cent in 2020, the largest drop in the post-World War II era, as COVID-19 crippled the economy. But it warned the dip was not a clear indication that the United States could meet its more ambitious pledge under the Paris Agreement, to cut emissions 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. Biden has said he plans to set the country on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, something a growing number of major economies are now promising to do. READ: Commentary - Joe Biden takes office in pivotal moment for climate action. Can he deliver? But he will first need to announce an emissions-cutting target for 2030 - one experts say must be in the order of 50 per cent below 2005 levels to give the world a chance of holding global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower Paris goal. Youth activists and some green groups have called for even more ambitious targets, saying the United States should aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 if it is to do its \"fair share\" to fight climate change. \"The United States is the second-largest emitter of carbon emissions from fossil fuels annually and the largest source of cumulative emissions to date.

Of its 54 countries, only South Africa has set a net-zero aim - and failure to revamp policies to benefit from a global low-carbon shift may mean Africa misses out on investment, said Wendy Hughes, a carbon markets manager at the World Bank Group. But officials from the continent noted that with sub-Saharan Africa currently producing less than 4 per cent of global emissions, \"carbon-cutting\" goals have limited relevance, with most African nations focused instead on creating jobs and economic growth. READ: Climate change action may seem 'optional' or 'too expensive' amid COVID-19 economic fallout: UK Ambassador to ASEAN LISTEN: The politics and path forward for international cooperation on climate mitigation With international investment already lacking in Africa - and some countries burned by disappointing promises of cash from sluggish carbon markets - many African countries are struggling to see net-zero policy as a priority, they added. </p><p>\"Without the financing, it's hard to have that incentive,\" said Damilola Ogunbiyi, special representative of the UN secretary-general for Sustainable Energy for All, noting investment in low-carbon energy systems in Africa had lagged. \"The funding is just not there,\" she said. Globally, a growing flood of countries, cities and regions from China to the European Union have set zero-carbon emissions targets over the last year or two, said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the Washington-based World Resources Institute. More than 1,000 major companies also have committed to emissions cuts in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, as have over 30 large investment groups managing US$5 trillion, she said. As those governments and companies put their plans in place, Africa could see both risks and benefits - from being shut out of tightening supply chains to winning a big share of carbon offset cash, African analysts told an online event during London Climate Action Week. \"CARBON-POSITIVE\" GABON Officials said Africa, with its key Congo Basin forests, is well-positioned to tap into new, fast-growing markets for carbon credits, which are sold to compensate for emissions elsewhere. Lee White, Gabon's environment minister, said his Central African nation, which has protected its forests carefully, was already absorbing 1 million more tonnes of carbon dioxide a year than it emitted.

But having financial incentives for safeguarding forests is crucial, he added - from ensuring what timber is cut is processed at home, creating jobs and income, to tapping into carbon markets as companies globally seek to offset emissions they cannot manage to eliminate. \"That's how we're going to get the Gabonese people and therefore Gabonese politicians thinking about how you maintain these forests. The forests have to become a valuable resource for us,\" White said. Without a clear financial incentive to keep forests standing and \"make the Congo Basin forests work for the Congo Basin people and countries\", no amount of aid or conservation grants will protect them, he said.

These are good investments,\" he said. For him, such finance is \"a much better way forward\" than seeking help from the Green Climate Fund, which gives loans and grants for developing countries to grow cleanly and adapt to climate change impacts. LOW INVESTMENT Ogunbiyi, of Sustainable Energy for All, said the lack of clean energy investment in countries like Gabon - with good low-carbon policies in place and political stability - was worrying.

Many African nations are interested in low-carbon growth - but few have received anywhere near enough finance to make it a reality, added Anthony Nyong, director of climate change and green growth for the African Development Bank. Meanwhile, initial payments for storing carbon have proved a disappointment in some countries, said Mithika Mwenda, executive director of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance. In Kenya, some farmers were promised payments for changing their practices to store more carbon in their soils and farm trees - but as the market price for carbon collapsed, they received little reward for their efforts, Mwenda said. The burden of addressing climate change, he said, must fall predominantly on the world's biggest and richest emitters, not on Africa or other poor nations. \"We cannot allow the developed countries to live their profligate lifestyles and think they can solve the climate crisis by asking farmers in Kenya and Gabon to absorb that carbon,\" he said. \"Even if you turn the whole of Africa green as an offset, I can assure you, we will not solve the climate change crisis.\" - Reuters/ic</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["LOW INVESTMENT Ogunbiyi, of Sustainable Energy for All, said the lack of clean energy investment in countries like Gabon - with good low-carbon policies in place and political stability - was worrying.

Many African nations are interested in low-carbon growth - but few have received anywhere near enough finance to make it a reality, added Anthony Nyong, director of climate change and green growth for the African Development Bank. Meanwhile, initial payments for storing carbon have proved a disappointment in some countries, said Mithika Mwenda, executive director of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance. In Kenya, some farmers were promised payments for changing their practices to store more carbon in their soils and farm trees - but as the market price for carbon collapsed, they received little reward for their efforts, Mwenda said. The burden of addressing climate change, he said, must fall predominantly on the world's biggest and richest emitters, not on Africa or other poor nations. \"We cannot allow the developed countries to live their profligate lifestyles and think they can solve the climate crisis by asking farmers in Kenya and Gabon to absorb that carbon,\" he said. \"Even if you turn the whole of Africa green as an offset, I can assure you, we will not solve the climate change crisis.

After days of uncertainty, the votes have tipped in favour of Joe Biden, and the US president-elect has since kicked off his transition team to tackle, among other things, climate change. During campaigning, Pennsylvania received a lot of attention from both presidential candidates. The state sits atop the Marcellus shale, a major source of natural gas; it is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the US, after Texas. </p><p>The industry employs about 32,000 people in Pennsylvania, but clean energy is among the fastest growing sectors in the state. Some speculated that Biden's stance on fossil fuel divestment, especially his comments during the final presidential debate on moving away from fossil fuels, might have turned away voters worried about their job security in these key states. Yet, the election results have shown the opposite. READ: Commentary: Why markets are upbeat about the US election results LISTEN: What is corporate climate action and why companies need a paradigm shift | EP 11 BIDEN'S CLIMATE PLATFORM IS NOT RADICAL During the final presidential debate, Biden argued that he would \"transition [away] from the oil industry ... because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time\". The principal policy he proposed was to stop federal subsidies to the oil and gas industry. After the debate, Biden's team clarified that his proposal means a gradual phase-out of fossil fuels and he would not impose bans on the oil and gas industry. In short, Biden has been strategically ambiguous about the timeline of decarbonising the US economy. He supports the idea of achieving net-zero emissions in the US by 2050, yet serious questions remain whether his budget-saving and market-oriented approach to fighting climate change would effectively discourage a carbon rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic. In June, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, issued a stern warning that \"the world only has six months to avert climate crisis\" - a post-lockdown rebound in global greenhouse gas emissions would substantially derail the global targets set by the Paris climate agreement signed in 2016. The US officially left the agreement on Nov 5, but Biden has promised that it will rejoin. In light of such policy recommendations, Biden's reliance on market mechanisms to slowly phase out fossil fuels presents, at best, a moderate approach to decarbonisation. READ: Rolling back Trump's rollbacks: Biden seen reversing climate deregulation Biden's stance on fracking further reveals his hesitance to take radical measures on the US fossil fuel addiction. During the final presidential debate, Biden repeatedly emphasised that he did not oppose fracking and would prefer to explore technical solutions to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. There are few readily available solutions for reducing the methane pollution associated with the fracking process. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas - 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in the first two decades after its release.

Previous research has addressed the pros and cons of fossil fuel divestment as a climate action tactic, the strong support it receives within higher education and its implications for climate justice. But there is no in-depth information available on undecided and conservative voters' perceptions on fossil fuel divestment. Prior to this election, climate change was a peripheral concern during presidential campaigns and debates. Scientific American highlighted that climate change received more attention during the first Trump versus Biden debate than in any other presidential debate in history. Comparing this year's election results with the final polling average and previous election results, two divergent trends emerge. In Colorado, which produces the most shale oil and gas in the US, voters remain supportive of Biden. Despite being defeated in Texas, the Democratic share of popular votes there increased to 46.4 per cent this year from 43.2 per cent in 2016. The results suggest one of two things: Either Biden's talk of fossil fuel divestment did not substantially change voters' minds, or it led to larger voter turnouts of progressive young voters. LISTEN: US election: A bitter fight for the soul of the world's most powerful nation READ: Commentary: The world has big expectations for a Joe Biden presidency The results in Ohio and Pennsylvania followed the same trend. Although Biden's performance in both states has been worse than the national polling average numbers, he gained a larger share of votes than Hillary Clinton in 2016. In Pennsylvania, Biden has managed to win 49.8 per cent of the votes, which is a solid performance considering Trump's strong pro-fracking push in Pennsylvania days before the election. At the county level, the dynamics become more complicated. In the southwest and northeast corners of the state where fracking activities concentrate, Trump held a decisive lead. In Bradford County, one of the most fracked places on the planet, Trump received over 70 per cent of the votes. READ: Commentary: Don't forget record numbers of Americans voted for Donald Trump Although election results suggest that fossil fuel divestment did not negatively impact Biden's overall election performance, it remains a pivotal and polarising topic for many states, and could be a challenge for future progressive contenders.

This year is on track to be one of the three hottest on record. The average global temperature in 2020 is set to be about 1.2\u00c2\u00b0C above pre-industrial (1850 to 1900) levels. There is at least a one-in-five chance of it temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C by 2024.</p><p>Why mention the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C threshold? Because we all committed five years ago, in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, to contain the rise in temperature at well below 2\u00c2\u00b0C and to strive to limit it to 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C by the end of the century. If our pledges \u00e2 \" the so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions \u00e2 \" stay what they are now, we will reach a global warming of over 3\u00c2\u00b0C, and miss our target.</p><p>The detrimental effects of climate change on the environment should not be seen as something too far away to care about. They are already jeopardising our livelihood. In some ocean basins, sea levels have risen to 20cm since the start of the satellite record in 1993. This trend is alarming for countries like Malaysia, where 70% of the population lives in coastal zones.</p><p>Regarding biodiversity, if we follow a business-as-usual approach, 20% to 30% of animal and plant species will be directly threatened by extinction. The heat waves and droughts are getting more frequent, impacting our water supplies and agriculture. On this current path, by the end of this century, what used to be once-in-20-years extreme heat days are projected to occur every two or three years.</p><p>Yet a gloom-and-doom attitude is not appropriate. Now is the time to act together. The Covid-19 crisis is an opportunity to take a step back and put climate at the top of our priorities.</p><p>We have to reset this new decade on a positive agenda. That is exactly why France, the UK and the UN, in partnership with Chile and Italy, decided to organise a virtual summit on Dec 12 to upgrade our pledges before the next Conference of the Parties to the Agreement in Glasgow in 2021.</p><p>Moreover, France has been pushing recently for an increase in the EU\u00e2  s pledge with a new target of a 55% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared with 1990 in order to align our commitments with the Paris Agreement. France is also supporting the ongoing transformation of the European Investment Bank into a European Climate Bank, which should make it possible to mobilise \u00e2 \u00ac1 trillion by 2030 in favour of ecological transition.</p><p>Turning the economy around is not only a necessity but also a great opportunity to create local jobs, generate growth and unleash innovation. The green transition is the next industrial revolution.</p><p>This crisis is an opportunity to make our economies greener and more resilient to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Among them is the unavoidable energy transition to reach SDG No 7, which is to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services by 2030.</p><p>Everyone is responsible for this change. Let\u00e2  s not waste the next decade and do this the right way.</p><p>Creating a fossil-free nation</p><p>The world\u00e2  s largest asset management company BlackRock recently conducted a survey among its clients around the world in order to better understand the tectonic shift in capital towards sustainable assets that is presently taking place. Its findings were clear, namely that investors recognise the importance of sustainable investing to risk-adjusted returns and are backing up this conviction with their asset allocation plans. Of the respondents, 86% stated that sustainable investing is already \u00e2 \" or will become \u00e2 \" central to their investment strategies.</p><p>So, climate is king and sustainable business is here to stay! And it does not matter if a company operates globally or is limited to its domestic market. For long-term profitability, sustainability is a necessary and worthwhile investment. Let me share some of the things that are happening in my country Sweden in the industry sector with a focus on climate action.</p><p>Sweden is aiming to be one of the world\u00e2  s first fossil-free welfare nations. Our long-term target is to have zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 at the latest and to achieve negative net emissions after that. One piece of the puzzle to achieve this ambitious goal is Fossil-free Sweden, which is a government initiative launched prior to the global climate summit in Paris in 2015 with a clear message: \u00e2  Sweden can and will be fossil-free\u00e2 . Under the Fossil-free Sweden umbrella, 22 industrial sectors have developed roadmaps showing how they can become fossil-free or climate-neutral while at the same time boosting their competitiveness. Based on this, Fossil-free Sweden now aims to identify and reduce obstacles for several upcoming industrial projects that will contribute to more jobs and greater welfare in Sweden while also providing the greatest global climate benefit.</p><p>The most talked-about projects so far are the HYBRIT development project in which steelmaker SSAB, iron ore producer LKAB and electricity producer Vattenfall are collaborating on a process to enable the reduction of steel from iron ore using hydrogen instead of carbon, and Northvolt, which will be Europe\u00e2  s biggest battery factory focusing on sustainability and recycling. Other industry sectors, such as aviation, cement, concrete, forest, construction and heavy road haulage, have also adopted roadmaps describing how they will become fossil-free and which technologies need to be developed.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the industry will need access to renewable energy. Today, more than 54% of Sweden\u00e2  s energy production comes from renewable sources. One important part is our waste management system, where 99.2% of household waste is reused or recycled. A lot of the waste is used to produce biofuel, district heating and electricity and many city buses run on biogas derived from waste and municipal sewage. In recent years, we have also seen an increase in the use of heat pumps, another contribution to a greater proportion of our energy coming from renewable sources. In the electricity sector, hydropower constitutes the main source of renewable energy, although we have seen huge investments in onshore and offshore wind farms in Sweden in the last couple of years.</p><p>And we can see that access to green and affordable electricity has attracted more investments to Sweden, for example in green batteries. This does not mean, however, that we can rest on our laurels. Production, storage and transportation of clean electricity must increase substantially \u00e2 \" both the HYBRIT project and Northvolt will require a lot of electricity \u00e2 \" if our journey to a fossil-free future is to be successful.

He lamented that G20 countries were channelling 50 per cent more of their COVID-19 stimulus to sectors related to fossil fuels, compared to those using low-carbon energy. Indeed, some would argue G20 countries are advanced economies today because they have burnt fossil fuels and contributed most of the man-made carbon dioxide emissions causing climate change. Most would argue the moral burden is on G20 countries to support adaptation and mitigation efforts across the world, especially in developing countries. READ: Commentary: Five years since Paris Agreement, world must get ambitious on climate action READ: Commentary: Big oil and coal exporters face reckoning as Paris Agreement turns five COUNTING BOTH METHANE AND CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS As a scientist who studies the Earth's climate, my first instinct is to look for evidence that rich countries today account for most of the world's historical carbon dioxide emissions. From publicly accessible data at OurWorldinData.org, the seven leading economies that have emitted the most carbon dioxide from 1751 to 2017 (from before the start of the Industrial Revolution until now), are: The US (399 billion tonnes), European Union nations (353 billion tonnes), China (200 billion tonnes), Russia (101 billion tonnes), Japan (62 billion tonnes), India (48 billion tonnes), and Canada (32 billion tonnes). These are also among the top eight economies by gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. However, carbon dioxide is not the only man-made greenhouse gas (GHG) that causes climate change. </p><p>While it makes up 76 per cent, methane accounts for another 16 per cent of the annual global GHG emission of 49 gigatonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide in 2010, according to the fifth and most recent Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel for Climate Change. Although human society emits annually much less methane than carbon dioxide, methane absorbs about 30 times more radiant energy in a period of 100 years, which means one tonne of methane is roughly equivalent to 30 tonnes of carbon dioxide for its 100-year global warming potential. How could climate change reshape your dinner? Listen to an expert break it down on The Climate Conversations podcast: (sl) TCC food As about half of anthropogenic methane comes from agriculture today, and this fraction was even higher in pre-industrial times, even ancient agrarian societies must be held responsible for methane emissions. But how far back the timeline should stretch is unclear. The Agricultural Revolution took place about 12,000 years ago, when mankind largely abandoned hunter-gatherer lifestyles and started planting crops and herding animals. Modern nations began taking shape many millennia later. Even then, agricultural production data across societies were not collected or preserved for the most part in history. READ: Commentary: Save forests or build 4-rooms? It's not a zero-sum game READ: Commentary: Let Singapore's green spaces grow wild DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' EMISSIONS WILL ECLIPSE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' Current GHG emissions are just as important to climate change as past emissions. The G20 nations include large, fast-developing economies which have seen some of the most rapid growth in recent years, like China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, which will continue to emit much GHG until 2100 and beyond. For the remainder of this century, many Asian, South American and African countries outside the G20 are also projected to accelerate their industrialisation and agricultural production. Some of their future economies would no doubt be big enough to challenge G20 members. Non-G20 nations together already make up about 27 per cent of the world's GDP in 2019, larger than the leading G20 economy, the US, which accounts for about 16 per cent. If they continue to exploit fossil fuels, especially natural gas which is cleaner than coal and oil, and perpetuate methane-producing farming practices, future history will only recount how one leading group of GHG-emitting nations was replaced by another group. With proper planning, mitigation efforts today can be tailored to cost less than projected costs of adaptation to avoid the potential loss of life and property, and to replace damaged ecosystem services under future climate change scenarios. Therefore, it is in the economic interest of non-G20 countries to finance in part their own shift towards renewable energies and sustainable agriculture today.

READ: Commentary: China's move on climate action signals arrival as a 'hybrid superpower' HARD TO PIN DOWN RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING FOSSIL FUELS We often personify nations as though they are morally responsible for an action like an individual is. But the people comprising a nation at present are entirely different from those centuries ago. To say that citizens of a nation today enjoy the fruits of past generations - and hence inherit the moral burden of their forebears - also ignores the fact that those fruits benefited people beyond that nation's border, due to international trade. For example, in the early 1800s, steam-powered cotton mills in England burnt coal for energy and produced textile that were exported and used all over the world. Furthermore, in the 19th and most of the 20th century, fossil fuels were the only technologically feasible and commercially available large-scale energy source that could reliably power entire industries and raise living standards. In this sense, the historical carbon dioxide emissions were an \"unavoidable evil\" in the pursuit of economic growth. (Let's also not forget the earliest scientific results providing evidence for the global warming effect of carbon dioxide was only published in 1896 by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius, long after fossil fuel adoption has become widespread across the world.) Likewise, we should also expect poorer countries to continue using fossil fuels if they receive no technological or economic assistance today to access renewable energies.

The good news is there is general consensus that G20 nations should bear more of the economic and technological burden for climate change, as with most challenges involving global commons, since they have the resources to do so. This is one of the longest standing social contract regarding climate action. At the same time, non-G20 nations must act responsibly because they are now aware that GHG emissions cause the Earth to warm up.

Super Typhoon Goni - known locally as Rolly - barrelled across the southern part of Luzon, the country's largest and most populous island, on Oct 30 leaving at least 25 people dead, nearly one million affected and extensive damage to infrastructure and agricultural land. Tens of thousands of homes were damaged, their occupants left stranded in evacuation centres. Overall, the bill is estimated to well exceed US$200 million. As the recovery process continued, Typhoon Vamco hit and caused major flooding in Manila on Thursday (Nov 12). At least 27 lives were lost. </p><p>Vamco was the 21st typhoon to hit the Philippines this year. For a population left reeling by COVID-19, it has been another sapping few weeks. Typhoons in the Philippines are becoming more regular, more intense and unpredictable. While damaging weather patterns are highly complex and multi-faceted, the science is all but settled on the climate-related factors that are contributing to the more frequent emergence of monster typhoons. About a quarter of the world's typhoons hit the Philippines, and while their number is not expected to rise in the years to come, because of climate change, they will hit harder and move along paths that are difficult to predict and prepare for. Between 2006 and 2016, 99 typhoons entered the Philippines; 10 of them were particularly deadly, most notably Typhoon Haiyan which killed at least 6,000 people in 2013. \"Most of the typhoons are intensifying, especially in the last quarter of the year. We are experiencing stronger typhoons than before and we can attribute it to the warming of the sea surface temperature and the warming of the atmosphere,\" said Esperanza Cayanan from the Office of the Deputy Administrator for Research and Development at PAGASA, the Philippines' national meteorological agency. \"Projecting our future is really scary. But we have to prepare. We have to think of ways to protect ourselves knowing we have these projections,\" she said. Warmer water, which is a symptom of climate change, helps give tropical typhoons their energy. The presence of the La Ni\u00f1a atmospheric phenomenon as a result of the cooling of sea surface temperature in the central Pacific Ocean means warmer waters currently persist around the Philippines, accelerating the formation of typhoons. As global temperatures increase, so too does the ability of the atmosphere to hold water vapour - the air can hold about 7 per cent more for every single degree rise. It means heavier rains being dumped over a typhoon's path. \"In the next century, tropical cyclones, such as Super Typhoon Haiyan will become the norm,\" said Associate Professor William Holden, a field expert from the University of Calgary's Department of Geography and Environmental Science Program. It presents big problems for highly vulnerable communities, who may have grown accustomed to regular storms but are equally fearful of the big ones. About 80 per cent of the country's population lives within 50km of the coast, where sea level rise is expected to become a growing issue. READ: Singapore to contribute US$200,000 in disaster relief for ASEAN nations hit by typhoon, floods Higher storm surges, which was the main cause of Typhoon Haiyan's destruction, will exponentially increase across islands of the archipelago, which are already witnessing higher-than-average sea level rise, making the Philippines one of the places most prone to land loss in the world. \"Sea level rise will see islands removed from the map. Looking at the Philippines, being an archipelago prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, we do not find many safe places anymore,\" said Cayanan of PAGASA. The casualty rate from Goni was relatively low compared to previous disasters, but that should not distract from its pure power and the need to better understand future risk, says Dr Antonio La Vi\u00f1a, environmental policy expert and executive director of the Manila Observatory. \"It's always a misperception when not too many people die because then we think it's not really serious when it is in fact,\" he said. \"The way I describe it is that Rolly destroyed one third of the island of Luzon.\" \"WE ARE TIRED OF BEING TOLD WE ARE RESILIENT\" Despite high prevailing levels of poverty across much of the Philippines, the regularity of damaging weather has seen its people gain a reputation for their ability to bounce back. While admirable, La Vi\u00f1a of the Manila Observatory says it has led to apathy among policymakers and authorities. \"We are tired of being told we are resilient. You have to change the situation that allows this to happen,\" he said. \"Resilience is a good thing if it's not an excuse for not doing the right things before the storms hit: when resilience is misused to justify negligence. \"You have to fix the systems in place so that people do not have to start all over again every time there's a storm. People are tired of being told this okay.\" Awareness is growing among the wider community about the havoc climate change is already wreaking. Regular storms on the horizon that were once simply part of life in this part of the world are now a reason to fear. READ: Dislocation and dysfunction hang over lives of Tacloban evacuees, five years after Typhoon Haiyan \"Most people are aware of the 'new normal' especially after Haiyan. Policy makers and ordinary people finally woke up to the perils of climate change,\" said Dr Rodel Lasco, executive director of The Oscar M Lopez Center for Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management Foundation. \"Moving forward, more intense typhoons will expose more of our vulnerabilities,\" he said. PAGASA is playing a leading role in awareness and education campaigns, particularly among young people. But \"experience is the best teacher\", according to Cayanan. \"It's very difficult to educate the public. Their memory of extreme events is only for a short period of time. But we are doing our best,\" she said. \"If you experience extreme events in your life, you will remember and you should pass that experience to the next generation.\" CHANGES TO CLIMATE ACTION POLICIES While typhoon mitigation is a work in progress, the Philippines has taken recent steps to be more proactive in a global problem. The country's climate action policies do not currently align with goals of the Paris Agreement, mainly due to the growth of the coal industry, but changes are afoot. The Department of Energy last month declared a moratorium on all new planned coal projects, with the aim of modernising the country's power generation on the back of cleaner and cheaper renewables. Energy security has been a problem with frequent network-wide outages in recent years, an issue that experts believe renewables can help solve, while also reducing national emissions. Still, it remains a country highly exposed to climate change, without contributing significantly to the global problem. \"Thus this becomes a discussion of 'climate justice',\" said Holden of the University of Calgary. Like many developing countries, working out ways to get compensated for climate damage caused by higher polluting nations is an important agenda. READ: Commentary - Rising temperatures, fires and floods highlight importance of understanding weather extremes \"We have to document all of this loss and damage. Then we can build better,\" La Vi\u00f1a said, while at the same time rejecting the notion that \"relatively low emissions\" can be an excuse for domestic inaction. \"The Philippines itself has to do its part because we cannot contribute to our own destruction,\" he said. \"We are not reducing our emissions considerably and there's a lot of space to do that in energy, forestry and agriculture without any real burden on us. In fact it could make our economy stronger. It's just that there's inaction at that level. \"Inside the Philippines we need to get the science better and eliminate the risks in some places by moving people early and changing our land use patterns,\" he said, adding that land reclamation actually makes the country more vulnerable. Many of the natural defences that the country had against disasters have been wiped out by human activity. Mangrove forests have been cleared and large-scale mining allowed to destabilise the earth and poison coral reefs. Reversing those trends and fast will be key for the Philippines if it wants to withstand the coming storm.</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["CHANGES TO CLIMATE ACTION POLICIES While typhoon mitigation is a work in progress, the Philippines has taken recent steps to be more proactive in a global problem.

So did workers in New York, Illinois and Minnesota. These and other Amazon.com Inc employees across the country are seizing on the coronavirus to demand the world's largest online retailer offer more paid sick time and temporarily shut warehouses with infections for deep cleaning. Employees in at least 11 states this year have voiced their concerns and staged actions to highlight a variety of purported workplace deficiencies, allegations the company has denied. Supporting these Amazon workers are labor groups and unions eager to penetrate the Seattle-based behemoth after years of failed attempts to unionize its operations. </p><p>Reuters spoke with 16 unions and labor groups targeting Amazon. They included established organizations such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), as well as newer worker advocacy groups like Warehouse Workers for Justice and Athena, a coalition of labor and social justice groups that have criticized Amazon's business practices. Most unions acknowledged their long odds at organizing Amazon using traditional tactics such as holding meetings and gauging interest. Legal hurdles to unionizing the company's workplaces and mounting elections are steep. For now, many groups said, they are showing workers how to harness public opinion to shame Amazon into granting concessions. The strategy proved effective in the national \"Fight for US$15\" campaign to raise the minimum wage. Labor organizations in recent years helped retail and fast-food workers stage highly publicized protests and social media campaigns to draw attention to their modest pay at a time when the economy was booming. Cities and states including Seattle, San Francisco, California, Arkansas and Missouri raised their minimum wages as did some large US employers, including Amazon, which attributed its pay hikes to a tight labor market as well as pressure from lawmakers and labor groups. In labor's latest efforts targeting Amazon, organizations are helping workers create online petitions, connect with elected officials, contact media and file labor complaints with the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The initiative puts public pressure on Amazon to respond, several groups said, while laying the groundwork for unions to recruit card-carrying members in the future. \"We expect that there will be more push for unionization when we get to the other side of this,\" said Stuart Applebaum, president of RWDSU. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said Amazon already offers what these groups are requesting: US$15 per hour or more to start, health benefits and opportunities for career growth. \"We encourage anyone interested in the facts to compare our overall pay and benefits, as well as our speed in managing this crisis, to other retailers and major employers across the country,\" she said. Central to the organizing effort, union officials said, is fear among some frontline Amazon workers over the spread of coronavirus in the company's warehouses. At least 800 workers in Amazon's 519 US distribution facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, based on internal company figures compiled by Jana Jumpp, an Amazon warehouse employee in Indiana, who shared the numbers with Reuters. Amazon sends text messages and automated calls to employees alerting them to positive cases in their facilities. Jumpp aggregates cases mentioned in messages sent to her by Amazon workers around the country. Jumpp said the informal process she has developed likely misses cases. She and other employees said Amazon does not share a running tally of cases at each facility or provide a nationwide count. \"We have no idea how many people are actually sick, not tested or out on quarantine,\" Jumpp said on a recent media call organized by Athena, the labor coalition. At least six Amazon workers have died of COVID-19, which the company confirmed publicly after each incident. Amazon's Lighty would not disclose to Reuters the total number of Amazon employees who have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States. She said the company's efforts to quarantine infected workers are helping to slow the spread, and rates of infection \"are at or below the communities we're operating in at almost all of our facilities.\" Lighty did not provide data to support that claim. A majority of Amazon employees are showing up at work and the company \"objects to the irresponsible actions of labor groups and others in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon,\" she said. Lighty said employee health and safety is the company's top priority. Amazon will spend more than US$800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, she said. Amazon over the past decade has eviscerated brick-and-mortar retail competitors, some of them unionized, while successfully fending off several attempts by its own employees to organize. With shutdowns now battering Main Street, Amazon is poised to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger than ever. The company reported record first-quarter sales of US$75.5 billion, up 26per cent from the same period a year ago, as customers sheltering in place have relied on its services and its stock price has risen 35 per cent since the start of the year. Amazon had nearly 600,000 US employees in 2019, according to its latest annual report, making it one of the largest employers in the country. In 2019, 10.3 per cent of US workers were union members, down from 20.1per cent in 1983, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over 33 million US workers have filed for unemployment benefits in recent weeks, strengthening the hand of employers at a time of mass unemployment. Still, some labor experts said coronavirus presents unions with their best shot in decades to make inroads at Amazon. \"Justice issues and safety at work tend to be the most powerful arguments in organizing,\" said Alex Colvin, a labor relations professor at Cornell University. \"They're the strongest reason for workers to want representation.\" He said unions have resorted to public relations as a tool to pressure companies as worker protections such as \"collective bargaining and employment rights enforcement have weakened.\" FIGHTING UNIONS Amazon has resisted unionization within its workforce since its founding in 1994. It defeated unionizing efforts in Seattle in 2000 and in Delaware in 2014 by a wide margin. In recent weeks it has fired at least four workers in three states who had publicly criticized the company and were involved in organizing. Lighty said Amazon has \"zero tolerance\" for retaliation. These workers were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but for violating policies such as physical distancing, she said. Among those sacked was Emily Cunningham, a Seattle-based activist with Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, who gained prominence for pushing the company to do more to fight global warming. She had recently circulated a petition calling for measures such as improved sick leave and urged all employees to agree on a day in April to call in sick to protest warehouse working conditions. \"There is a lot of frustration on how Amazon is handling the issue of workplace safety,\" Cunningham said. She said she has been in touch with the AFL-CIO about the sickout, and a local affiliate of the union called MLK Labor has offered support to continue the fight on working conditions. MLK Labor confirmed it is working with employees that Amazon fired in Seattle. The AFL-CIO's secretary treasurer, Elizabeth Shuler, said the union is using the pandemic to galvanize Amazon workers at company headquarters and enlist support from elected officials. Amazon had over 53,000 employees in Seattle in 2019. \"Amazon's backyard is Seattle, and that's a major focus for us in terms of how to take the energy, the courage, the activism that we are already seeing there and build that into a real movement,\" she said. Amazon's Lighty said the company has listened to complaints and implemented over 150 measures to keep workers safe. The company is also running television advertisements thanking warehouse workers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in April showed up at a Texas distribution center and met workers to show his support. NEW APPROACH But a steady rise in the number of infections at warehouses has spurred more protests. Amazon worker Mario Crippen led an April 1 walkout at a Michigan warehouse to protest what he said was a lack of transparency from the company about the number of infections. He said about 40 workers participated in that action at the facility in Romulus, about 24 miles southwest of Detroit. Amazon disputed that figure, saying fewer than 15 people participated. Helping Crippen was labor nonprofit United for Respect, which coached him on how to gain media attention without getting fired and use social media to gather more supporters. The group also offered legal help from attorneys if he was terminated. Crippen, 26, whose job is to stow products at the warehouse, told Reuters he felt as if \"somebody had my back.\" He said at least 25 workers at the Romulus warehouse have tested positive, according to figures compiled by employees at the site. Crippen said some workers want the facility shut down for cleaning, and plan to continue protesting working conditions while exploring the idea of working closely with labor groups and unions in the future. Amazon spokeswoman Lighty did not comment about the Romulus protest, the number of cases at the site or the company's decision to not shut down the facility. She said Amazon's decision to handle the closure of a building for deep cleaning depends on several factors, including consulting with health authorities and medical experts. A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Labor said the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA), received employee complaints about the Romulus site and sent a letter to Amazon listing steps the company \"could take to correct the hazards.\" She and MIOSHA would not provide more information. Lighty did not comment on the details in the letter. Some labor organizers are instructing workers on how to file such safety complaints.

So did workers in New York, Illinois and Minnesota. These and other Amazon.com Inc employees across the country are seizing on the coronavirus to demand the world's largest online retailer offer more paid sick time and temporarily shut warehouses with infections for deep cleaning. Employees in at least 11 states this year have voiced their concerns and staged actions to highlight a variety of purported workplace deficiencies, allegations the company has denied. Supporting these Amazon workers are labour groups and unions eager to penetrate the Seattle-based behemoth after years of failed attempts to unionise its operations. </p><p>Reuters spoke with 16 unions and labour groups targeting Amazon. They included established organizations such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), as well as newer worker advocacy groups like Warehouse Workers for Justice and Athena, a coalition of labour and social justice groups that have criticized Amazon's business practices. Most unions acknowledged their long odds at organising Amazon using traditional tactics such as holding meetings and gauging interest. Legal hurdles to unionising the company's workplaces and mounting elections are steep. For now, many groups said, they are showing workers how to harness public opinion to shame Amazon into granting concessions. The strategy proved effective in the national \"Fight for US$15\" campaign to raise the minimum wage. Labour organizations in recent years helped retail and fast-food workers stage highly publicized protests and social media campaigns to draw attention to their modest pay at a time when the economy was booming. Cities and states including Seattle, San Francisco, California, Arkansas and Missouri raised their minimum wages as did some large U.S. employers, including Amazon, which attributed its pay hikes to a tight labour market as well as pressure from lawmakers and labour groups. In labour's latest efforts targeting Amazon, organizations are helping workers create online petitions, connect with elected officials, contact media and file labour complaints with the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The initiative puts public pressure on Amazon to respond, several groups said, while laying the groundwork for unions to recruit card-carrying members in the future. \"We expect that there will be more push for unionization when we get to the other side of this,\" said Stuart Applebaum, president of RWDSU. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said Amazon already offers what these groups are requesting: US$15 per hour or more to start, health benefits and opportunities for career growth. \"We encourage anyone interested in the facts to compare our overall pay and benefits, as well as our speed in managing this crisis, to other retailers and major employers across the country,\" she said. Central to the organizing effort, union officials said, is fear among some frontline Amazon workers over the spread of coronavirus in the company's warehouses. At least 800 workers in Amazon's 519 U.S. distribution facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, based on internal company figures compiled by Jana Jumpp, an Amazon warehouse employee in Indiana, who shared the numbers with Reuters. Amazon sends text messages and automated calls to employees alerting them to positive cases in their facilities. Jumpp aggregates cases mentioned in messages sent to her by Amazon workers around the country. Jumpp said the informal process she has developed likely misses cases. She and other employees said Amazon does not share a running tally of cases at each facility or provide a nationwide count. \"We have no idea how many people are actually sick, not tested or out on quarantine,\" Jumpp said on a recent media call organised by Athena, the labour coalition. At least six Amazon workers have died of COVID-19, which the company confirmed publicly after each incident. Amazon's Lighty would not disclose to Reuters the total number of Amazon employees who have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States. She said the company's efforts to quarantine infected workers are helping to slow the spread, and rates of infection \"are at or below the communities we're operating in at almost all of our facilities.\" Lighty did not provide data to support that claim. A majority of Amazon employees are showing up at work and the company \"objects to the irresponsible actions of labour groups and others in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon,\" she said. Lighty said employee health and safety is the company's top priority. Amazon will spend more than US$800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, she said. Amazon over the past decade has eviscerated brick-and-mortar retail competitors, some of them unionized, while successfully fending off several attempts by its own employees to organise. With shutdowns now battering Main Street, Amazon is poised to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger than ever. The company reported record first-quarter sales of US$75.5 billion (62 billion pounds), up 26per cent from the same period a year ago, as customers sheltering in place have relied on its services and its stock price has risen 35per cent since the start of the year. Amazon had nearly 600,000 U.S. employees in 2019, according to its latest annual report, making it one of the largest employers in the country. In 2019, 10.3per cent of U.S. workers were union members, down from 20.1per cent in 1983, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over 33 million U.S. workers have filed for unemployment benefits in recent weeks, strengthening the hand of employers at a time of mass unemployment. Still, some labour experts said coronavirus presents unions with their best shot in decades to make inroads at Amazon. \"Justice issues and safety at work tend to be the most powerful arguments in organising,\" said Alex Colvin, a labour relations professor at Cornell University. \"They're the strongest reason for workers to want representation.\" He said unions have resorted to public relations as a tool to pressure companies as worker protections such as \"collective bargaining and employment rights enforcement have weakened.\" FIGHTING UNIONS Amazon has resisted unionization within its workforce since its founding in 1994. It defeated unionising efforts in Seattle in 2000 and in Delaware in 2014 by a wide margin. In recent weeks it has fired at least four workers in three states who had publicly criticized the company and were involved in organising. Lighty said Amazon has \"zero tolerance\" for retaliation. These workers were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but for violating policies such as physical distancing, she said. Among those sacked was Emily Cunningham, a Seattle-based activist with Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, who gained prominence for pushing the company to do more to fight global warming. She had recently circulated a petition calling for measures such as improved sick leave and urged all employees to agree on a day in April to call in sick to protest warehouse working conditions. \"There is a lot of frustration on how Amazon is handling the issue of workplace safety,\" Cunningham said. She said she has been in touch with the AFL-CIO about the sickout, and a local affiliate of the union called MLK Labor has offered support to continue the fight on working conditions. MLK Labor confirmed it is working with employees that Amazon fired in Seattle. The AFL-CIO's secretary treasurer, Elizabeth Shuler, said the union is using the pandemic to galvanize Amazon workers at company headquarters and enlist support from elected officials. Amazon had over 53,000 employees in Seattle in 2019. \"Amazon's backyard is Seattle, and that's a major focus for us in terms of how to take the energy, the courage, the activism that we are already seeing there and build that into a real movement,\" she said. Amazon's Lighty said the company has listened to complaints and implemented over 150 measures to keep workers safe. The company is also running television advertisements thanking warehouse workers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in April showed up at a Texas distribution center and met workers to show his support. NEW APPROACH But a steady rise in the number of infections at warehouses has spurred more protests. Amazon worker Mario Crippen led an April 1 walkout at a Michigan warehouse to protest what he said was a lack of transparency from the company about the number of infections. He said about 40 workers participated in that action at the facility in Romulus, about 24 miles southwest of Detroit. Amazon disputed that figure, saying fewer than 15 people participated. Helping Crippen was labour nonprofit United for Respect, which coached him on how to gain media attention without getting fired and use social media to gather more supporters. The group also offered legal help from attorneys if he was terminated. Crippen, 26, whose job is to stow products at the warehouse, told Reuters he felt as if \"somebody had my back.\" He said at least 25 workers at the Romulus warehouse have tested positive, according to figures compiled by employees at the site. Crippen said some workers want the facility shut down for cleaning, and plan to continue protesting working conditions while exploring the idea of working closely with labour groups and unions in the future. Amazon spokeswoman Lighty did not comment about the Romulus protest, the number of cases at the site or the company's decision to not shut down the facility. She said Amazon's decision to handle the closure of a building for deep cleaning depends on several factors, including consulting with health authorities and medical experts. A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Labor said the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA), received employee complaints about the Romulus site and sent a letter to Amazon listing steps the company \"could take to correct the hazards.\" She and MIOSHA would not provide more information. Lighty did not comment on the details in the letter. Some labour organizers are instructing workers on how to file such safety complaints. They are also using Facebook Live, Instagram posts, Telegram chats and WhatsApp messages to share other tactics with Amazon employees.

The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is meeting this week in Incheon, South Korea, and plans to discuss the report, which will determine whether global warming this century can be kept to a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The IPCC aims to release the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C on Oct 8. \"The main issue of the report discussion will be around how we can get to a 1.5 degree limit and what will be the carbon (emissions) budget available to do that,\" said Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University. </p><p>In 2015, nearly 200 nations pledged in Paris to limit the global average temperature rise to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times while \"pursuing efforts\" for a tougher 1.5 degrees Celsius goal. The IPCC report, seen as the main scientific guide for combating climate change, will provide guidance on the required actions to combat climate change. There has already been a rise of 1 degree Celsius since the mid-1800s as industrialisation produced rising emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. According to a draft of the report seen in June but subject to change, governments can still limit temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius but only with \"rapid and far-reaching\" action. The draft said current pledges in the Paris Agreement are too weak to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The document said there was a need to increase renewable energy output by 60 per cent between 2020 and 2050, while energy from coal should be scaled back by two-thirds. By 2050, that means renewables would supply between 49 per cent and 67 per cent of primary energy.

The 16-year-old has become the face of youth climate action, going from a lone child sitting outside the Swedish parliament building in mid-2018 to a symbol for climate strikers - young and old - around the world. Thunberg was far from the first young person to speak up in an effort to hold the powerful accountable for their inaction on climate change, yet the recognition of her efforts come at a time when world leaders will have to decide whether - or with how much effort - they will tackle climate change. Their actions or inactions will determine how much more vocal youth will become in 2020.

Today's youth saw themselves on the generational frontlines of climate change, so they walked out of their schools to demand transformative action. The strikes spread throughout the fall and winter, and spilled over to 2019. Students in the United Kingdom joined the movement on Feb 15, 2019 with a mass mobilisation, on the heels of Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Japan and many other countries around the world. They skipped school because they felt there was no point to school without a future, and their resistance took their grievances around generational injustice directly to elected officials.

Secwepemc leaders and their allies have built tiny houses to prevent the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from being forced through unceded Secwepemc territory. There's been resistance to fracking.

This mirrors Indigenous-led environmental action against energy projects around the world, including work in Karen communities in Thailand, Indigenous peoples in Colombia, Waorani peoples in Ecuador, among Saami peoples and countless other Indigenous nations. REJECTING INACTION The climate strikes are an example of youth becoming politicised, rejecting adult inaction and demanding more from governments. LISTEN: Heart of the Matter podcast - Talking about the Madrid climate talks, what happened and what's next? In the coming years, we can expect the climate movement to keep growing, become even more politicised and escalate the intensity of tactics. When governments resist reasonable requests, decades of social movements teach us that activists escalate. \\We can look at the histories of the HIV/AIDS movement, the Civil Rights movement, African liberation struggles and \"poor people's movements,\" which show us that when people get pushed out, they turn up the pressure. That escalation is necessary to win substantive change. Escalation is not usually seen by the public as nice as polite entreaties, but research clearly shows that direct action leads to change. Greta's recognition by Time Magazine will continue to inspire more young people to join their peers in demanding bold climate action like the Green New Deal and to use the legal system as a tool by suing governments over climate inaction. If elected officials fail to act, we can expect these young people to adopt more disruptive tactics and do the work on the ground to elect new leaders. Even if they can't yet vote themselves, there are many ways they can- and will continue to- shape our politics and our future.

How dare you?\" Here's what you need to know about the 16-year-old activist: SHE HAS ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, OCD AND SELECTIVE MUTISM Greta Thunberg was born on Jan 3, 2003 in Stockholm. She was about eight years old when she first heard about climate change. Thunberg found it \"too unreal\" that no one was doing anything about it and, at age 11, fell into depression. She stopped eating and speaking, she said in a TED talk. Later she was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder and selective mutism. In her talk at TEDxStockholm, she said this means she \"only speaks when (she) thinks it's necessary - now is one of those moments\".       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzGj1NZilgq/\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BzGj1NZilgq/</url> \"I overthink,\" she said in an interview with The Guardian earlier this year. \"Some people can just let things go, but I can't especially if there's something that worries me or makes me sad.\" She recalled that when she was younger, she would cry when teachers showed her class films of plastic in the ocean and starving polar bears. \"My classmates were concerned when they watched the film, but when it stopped, they started thinking about other things. I couldn't do that. Those pictures were stuck in my head.\" SHE WAS JUST 15 WHEN SHE STARTED HER CLIMATE STRIKE In August 2018, Greta skipped school and sat outside the Swedish parliament to protest climate change. Thunberg said in a Facebook post that she initially planned and carried out the strike all by herself, as no one was interested in joining her at that time. While outside parliament, she handed out fliers with a long list of facts about the climate crisis and explanations on why she was striking.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Y8a7riiVA/\">https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Y8a7riiVA/</url> \"The first thing I did was to post on Twitter and Instagram what I was doing and it soon went viral. Then journalists and newspapers started to come,\" she said. This eventually evolved into the Fridays for Future movement, which saw millions of young people march in their home countries in support of Greta. CHANGE BEGAN AT HOME Thunberg's revolution started at home with her parents, opera singer Malena Ernman and actor Svante Thunberg. When Thunberg first approached them with her idea of school striking, they were not supportive. \"They did not support the idea of school striking and they said that if I were to do this I would have to do it completely by myself and with no support from them,\" Thunberg said.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/gretathunbergsweden/posts/767646880269801\">https://www.facebook.com/gretathunbergsweden/posts/767646880269801</url> She eventually convinced her family to start lowering their carbon footprint by adopting a vegan diet and giving up air travel, which also meant her mother had to give up performing internationally. SHE SAILED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC INSTEAD OF FLYING To reach the United States and take part in the United Nations summit, Thunberg shunned air travel in favour of a trans-Atlantic voyage on a racing yacht. The 18-metre boat was fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines that produced electricity onboard. The catch? The boat had no showers or toilets - those on board had to use a blue bucket.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1jk-7KCtBC/\">https://www.instagram.com/p/B1jk-7KCtBC/</url> \"Greta taking on this challenge of sailing across on a race boat with zero comfort really shows her commitment to the cause and how far she's willing to push herself,\" said the boat's skipper. According to a TIME report, the trip on the racing sailboat from Plymouth in the United Kingdom took about two weeks.

The Southeast Asian country is joining more than two dozen other countries looking to add nuclear power to their energy mix, including neighbours Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said on Tuesday reviving the mothballed 620-megawatt nuclear plant in Bataan province, northwest of Manila, will require a US$1 billion investment. </p><p>Nuclear generation is one of the options for the Philippines to meet its growing power needs, with annual electricity demand expected to rise by an average 5 percent until 2030, he said. \"We have to weigh all our options, with emphasis not just on meeting capacity requirements, but sustainability and environmental obligations as well,\" Cusi said, speaking at the opening of a three-day international conference on nuclear power in Manila. Cusi will revive a government task force created in 2007 to study nuclear power as an alternative to imported fuel oil and coal, which currently provide more than half of the country's energy mix. He said technical experts, including those from the International Atomic Energy Agency, have been invited to help the country identify the next steps and come up with a \"well-informed\" decision. Cusi is not committing any timetable for the study, but he expects the move to reignite protests against the project, especially by environmentalists and the Catholic Church arguing restarting the plant is unsafe and expensive. \"We need to move away from fossil fuels like coal but nuclear energy is not safe and will also harm the people and environment,\" said Zaira Patricia Baniaga of the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice in a statement issued before the conference. The late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos order the plant built in 1976 in response to rising energy prices and it was finished in 1984. The facility never started generating electricity after it was declared unsafe because it sits on a major earthquake fault line and lies near the Pinatubo volcano, which was dormant at that time. Pinatubo's 1991 eruption had no effect on the Bataan plant, 70 km (45 miles) away, but the project was mothballed in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.

A vast human tragedy, it is one of the least reported, least recognised, least understood issues before us.</p><p>Stunting, caused by chronic under nutrition early in a child's life, blights the lives of some 165 million children around the world. It is far more than a problem of inadequate growth/height for these children. It can trap them in a lifetime cycle of poor nutrition, illness, poverty and inequity.</p><p>Why? Because stunted growth in the first months of a child's life means stunted development of the brain and thus, of cognitive capacity. Permanently.</p><p>Stunting hampers not only the future ability of an individual child to learn and earn, but also the social and economic progress of the countries in which they live. In real terms, it cuts school performance, translating into a reduction in adult income by 22 per cent on average. It also leads to increased risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adult life.</p><p>In 2011 it was estimated that more than one in every four children under five in the developing world were stunted, or 28 per cent -- an estimated 160 million children. 80 per cent of children globally live in just 14 countries. Stunting continues to be highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and is highest among low-income countries.</p><p>High stunting rates are part of the reason why the world is not on track to reach most of the Millennium Development Goals, notably on extreme poverty and hunger, child and maternal health, and combating HIV and AIDS. Under nutrition contributes to one-third of child deaths and around one-fifth of maternal deaths.</p><p>The good news is that it does not have to be this way. In fact, attacking stunting is a huge development opportunity. And a cost effective one.</p><p>We know what works. Expectant mothers need vital nutrients like iron and folic acid; newborn babies need that natural \"superfood\" -- breastfeeding, in that first fragile hour after birth and then for the next six months. Adequate solid foods need to be introduced at the right time. Throughout, adequate health care and good hygiene and sanitation are vital. Poor sanitation and thus repeated bouts of diarrhoea contribute to stunting.</p><p>In 2008, eight of the world's leading economists, including five Nobel Laureates, in the so-called Copenhagen Consensus, recommended priorities for confronting the top 10 global challenges. They ranked providing young children with micronutrients the number one most cost-effective way to advance global welfare. And last year, they reached a similar conclusion.</p><p>More good news: while stunting may be under-appreciated as a global challenge and opportunity, there is a growing international response, to which the conference in Dublin will contribute.

The \u00e2  loss and damage\u00e2  proposal, backed by the United States and other countries, could help vulnerable nations gain access to insurance and other support to cut their financial risks from climate stresses, experts said. But the proposal, one of two, would explicitly rule out the prospect of poor countries that suffer devastating losses from climate change seeking compensation under the agreement from rich nations, whose emissions have been largely responsible for causing the problems, they said. \u00e2  This pretty clearly throws poor and vulnerable people under the bus, and it has really troubling legal implications,\u00e2  said Brandon Wu, a senior policy analyst for ActionAid USA and a longtime tracker of finance and justice issues at the talks. </p><p>His colleague Harjeet Singh, ActionAid\u00e2  s global lead on climate change, said the provision, if adopted, could push climate-affected countries to sue for compensation under general international law, instead of dealing with loss and damage under the agreement. Michael Jacobs, a political and economic scientist at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations, agreed that \"the possibility of that in international law is not removed by this deal\". But for island nations that may see their land disappear to rising seas, and other vulnerable countries that could face huge financial losses from climate change, \u00e2  we are taking away their right forever to demand justice\u00e2  under the new agreement, Singh said. Without the threat of lawsuits to drive aggressive action on climate change, \u00e2  the pressure is off\u00e2  on wealthier polluting nations, he said. Climate justice activists said the move to block liability for emissions was a particular affront by wealthy countries because poorer nations earlier this year had stopped calling for compensation, in an effort secure a place for a loss and damage mechanism in a binding Paris agreement. Now, poorer countries might prefer to see efforts to deal with loss and damage excluded entirely rather than settle for a deal that permanently limits their rights, said Sven Harmeling, climate change advocacy coordinator for CARE International. \u00e2  Loss and damage is still totally at risk in this agreement,\u00e2  he said. Wu said one worry if the proposed language was adopted is that it could have implications for the success of climate lawsuits outside the U.N. climate deal, and could \u00e2  narrow the scope of what loss and damage can do\u00e2  even within the deal. Early lawsuits or human rights complaints seeking damages from oil, gas and coal companies have recently been filed in countries from Germany to the Philippines. These could help drive divestment from fossil fuel companies, as investors fret over the implications for their reputations and profits, lawsuit backers say. Any kind of legal precedent that polluters are not liable for climate damage could potentially threaten that divestment push, which would be \u00e2  really unfortunate\u00e2 , Wu said. Similarly, the provision \u00e2 \" if included in the final deal \u00e2 \" could have a \u00e2  chilling effect\u00e2  on discussions around ways to deal with loss and damage that could be seen as evoking liability or compensation. \u00e2  People will say, 'This is going to lead us down the path to (talking about) liability, so we can\u00e2  t have this conversation,'\u00e2  he said.

In the French capital, where demonstrations were banned by the authorities after attacks by Islamic State militants killed 130 people on Nov. 13, activists laid out more than 20,000 shoes in the Place de la Republique to symbolize absent marchers on the eve of the summit. Among the high heels and sandals were a pair of plain black shoes sent by Pope Francis, who has been a vocal advocate for action to prevent dangerous climate change, and jogging shoes from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. </p><p>One activist, dressed in white as an angel with large wings, held a sign saying \"coal kills\". About 10,000 people joined arms to form a human chain through Paris along the 3-km (2-mile) route of the banned march, organisers said. More than 2,000 events were held in cities including London, Sao Paulo, New York and Asuncion, Paraguay, on the eve of the Paris summit which runs from Nov. 30-Dec. 11 and will be attended by about 150 heads of government. \"Over 570,000 people called with one voice for global leaders to deliver a 100 percent clean energy future at the Paris summit,\" said Emma Ruby-Sachs, campaign director of Avaaz, one of the organisers. Around the world, activists marched, dressed as polar bears or penguins at risk from melting ice, or chanted slogans such as \"climate justice\". Organisers said that 570,000 people so far had taken part in rallies worldwide and that they expected demonstrations including in Ottawa and Mexico City later in the day to push the count above 600,000. \"These are the biggest set of global marches in history,\" said Sam Barratt at Avaaz. There was no independent verification of the numbers, although none of the individual marches rivalled one in New York last year that drew an estimated 310,000 people. CLASHES IN PARIS In Sydney, about 45,000 people are estimated to have marched through the central business district towards the Opera House. Protesters held placards reading: \u00e2  There is no Planet B,\u00e2  and \u00e2  Say no to burning national forests for electricity\u00e2 . In London, organisers said 50,000 marchers were joined by fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, actress Emma Thompson and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said the turnout was especially impressive for a wet November Sunday. Almost all the demonstrations were peaceful, but riot police fired tear gas and clashed with about 200 protesters in Paris, some wearing masks, in the Place de la Republique. Police detained 149 people for questioning. French President Francois Hollande criticised the protests as scandalous amid the candles and flowers left on the square in memory of the 130 killed on Nov. 13. The demonstrators had carried banners calling for the defence of the climate and democracy. U.S. President Barack Obama and China's Xi Jinping will be among the leaders attending the start of the summit, which organisers hope will produce a legally binding agreement to commit both rich and developing nations to curbing emissions of greenhouse gases, blamed for warming the planet, beyond 2020. Hopes are high that the Paris summit will not fail like the previous such meeting six years ago in Copenhagen. Popular and political momentum for tougher action on carbon emissions has accelerated in recent years, with 2015 set to be the warmest on record. Activists are seeking to combat everything from Beijing\u00e2  s smoggy skies to Canada\u00e2  s Keystone oil pipeline. Saiba Suso, a 26-year-old demonstrator in Paris, said the poor were most at risk: \"We are paying the price and we are not the cause. The industrialised countries owe us a lot.\" Still, all sides say pledges made in Paris will be insufficient to limit a rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, widely viewed as a threshold for dangerous changes in the planet's climate system.

The direct cause of the crisis is the severe drought this year that has affected 80% of the US, and hit Russia and Australia as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The drought has shrivelled key crops like corn, wheat and soybeans, causing global prices to jump 6% in July after three months of decline.</p><p>Last week, three United Nations food agencies urged governments to take quick action to prevent a repeat of the 2007/08 food crises that sparked bread riots in some 30 countries.</p><p>The indications are that 2013 will be another year of global crisis, according to commentators like author David Frum, although others are not so pessimistic.</p><p>More contentious, however, is the approach taken by international institutions, including the World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation to address the issue of food security.</p><p>Critics of these institutions argue that they promote an industrial model of agriculture that \u00e2  threatens the viability of ecosystems and contributes massively to climate change\u00e2 . Some 120 civil society groups said as much in a statement of concern issued ahead of the 2nd Global Conference on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change that began in Hanoi last Monday.</p><p>The groups, from both the North and South, argued that the central themes of the Hanoi conference were heavily contested. They pointed out that the approaches had not been sufficiently considered from the perspective of peasants, small-scale producers and indigenous peoples, who are suffering the worst effects of climate change.</p><p>The groups were also concerned at the lack of transparency, participation and consultation with many governments in the preparation for the conference. Moreover, they said, the roadmap from the previous conference, held in the Hague in October 2010, was neither endorsed by attending governments nor accepted as a binding outcome.</p><p>The impact of industrial agriculture on climate change was highlighted in a briefing note for the Hanoi conference, based on information from the Climate Justice Now! group. The note, released by the Third World Network, stated that developed countries, with 17% of the world\u00e2  s population, are responsible for 26% of global nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils, 30% of methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation due to the digestive processes of ruminants, and 52% of CH4 and N2O emissions from manure management.</p><p>Yet, market-based approaches are being promoted by the international institutions, allowing developed countries to continue rather than change their unsustainable production and consumption patterns. Furthermore, this forces emissions reduction responsibilities onto peasants and small producers in developing countries.</p><p>Instead of focusing on the protection of agriculture from climate change, the groups said, the conference programme appeared to endorse a greater role for the private sector to invest in schemes that would commodify natural resources and disenfranchise local and indigenous communities.</p><p>The priority should be to work with local food producers to help them conserve, store and further develop their own varieties and breeds. \u00e2  It is clear that the best hedge against the increasing instability of local climates in the future is a diversity of varieties and breeds to address the threat of increasing floods, drought and storms,\u00e2  the civil society groups said.</p><p>Instead, industrial agriculture has reduced the number of farmers\u00e2   varieties and breeds drastically and has therefore dangerously reduced the basis of food security for the future, their statement said.</p><p>There is also a critical need to reverse the economic concentration of global markets \u00e2 \" particularly for grains, livestock and food processing \u00e2 \" that has led to unsustainable forms of industrial agriculture worldwide and are responsible for the bulk of the emissions from the agriculture sector.</p><p>Moreover, carbon market mechanisms actually finance the emissions reduction commitments of developed countries through \u00e2  offsetting\u00e2  projects in developing countries. This not only increases the threat of climate change by allowing developed countries to continue rather than change their unsustainable production and consumption patterns, but also forces emissions reduction responsibilities onto peasants and small producers in developing countries. Developed country mitigation and \u00e2  offsetting\u00e2  priorities should not and cannot drive discussions on the nexus between climate change, food security and agriculture, they emphasised.</p><p>The upshot is that nothing less than a system change \u00e2 \" towards ecological agriculture, based on principles that create healthy soils and cultivate biological diversity, and which prioritise farmers\u00e2   and traditional knowledge \u00e2 \" is needed.</p><p>The landscape approach, promoted by the World Bank, had a high profile in the conference agenda.</p><p>Using a market-based approach to convert large tracts of landscape that include water, land, agriculture and forests into commodities is unethical when it comes to the question of food security. Further, land-grabbing in the developing world had become an ever greater concern since the first conference, particularly as financial assets become unreliable and both state and private actors secured land for financial gain and food security.</p><p>This point finds resonance in a news analysis last week on commodities and financial instruments, in which Jennifer Clapp, a Canada-based academic on global environmental governance, noted: \u00e2  NGOs have highlighted the strong correlation between financial market deregulation, increased financial investment in agricultural commodities and food price volatility. Reports such as the World Development Movement\u00e2  s Broken Markets, Oxfam\u00e2  s policy brief Not a Game and Friends of the Earth\u00e2  s Farming Money, have made this case.\u00e2 </p><p>Quoting a recent report in the Financial Times, she said that most financial institutions are in fact deeply involved in much more sophisticated financial products linked to the agricultural sector that reach deeper into agricultural commodity chains than the index funds that simply track prices of commodities. They are getting into investments that track the performance of agricultural commodity-related firms, and also directly into farmland.</p><p>This converges with the concerns expressed by the civil society groups about the food and climate conference last week. But climate change has merely precipitated the mounting crisis that is engulfing the global financial system. The time has come for economies to be organised once again as if people mattered.</p><p>R B Bhattacharjee is associate editor at The Edge</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Malaysia", "instances": ["Some 120 civil society groups said as much in a statement of concern issued ahead of the 2nd Global Conference on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change that began in Hanoi last Monday.
