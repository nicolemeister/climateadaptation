After losing almost half of his 1,200 hives of Ligurian bees to the blazes on the island, Davis hopes relocating the remainder to unburnt forest and a food supply of eucalypt sugar gums will save them. Kangaroo Island, about 15,000km away from the Ligurian bees' ancestral home of Italy, is believed to host the world's last genetically pure population of the species. </p><p>READ: Dust storms and giant hail batter bushfire-weary Australia The bees were imported to South Australia in 1885 and officials banned the introduction of any other bee species or honey since, making it a sanctuary for Ligurian bees. Italy's pure stock of the bees was wiped out due to interbreeding and disease. Bushfires burnt a third of Kangaroo Island over New Year, killing two people and destroying an estimated quarter of the island's 4,000 Ligurian hives as well as the eucalypts that feed that the bees. \"The main tree for food at this time of the year is the Sugar Gum, Eucalyptus cladocalyx, that grows all along the North Coast which has been devastated by fire,\" another Kangaroo Island Ligurian honey producer, David Clifford, told Reuters. \"So we are not going to get a honey supply from that this year and it will take 15 years for it to recover.\" While Clifford's bees escaped the flames, he said the insects appeared \"very disorientated\" and \"more aggressive\" than usual after they were relocated. Davis said the destruction has lost him about 20 tonnes of honey for this season alone and cost him an estimated A$500,000 (US$340,000) including lost production from the surviving hives. Ligurian honey is used to make a range of high-end products including hand creams and candles.

Although there's no safe level of air pollution, the health hazards tend to be greatest for vulnerable groups. Alongside people with pre-existing conditions, smoke exposure presents unique risks for pregnant women. Research shows prolonged exposure to bushfire smoke increases the risk of pregnancy complications including high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, low birth weight and premature birth (before 37 weeks). READ: Commentary: Australian bushfires threaten drinking water safety. </p><p>The consequences could last decades These conditions can have short-term and lifelong effects on a baby's health, with increased risk of conditions including cerebral palsy and visual or hearing impairment. Even babies born only a few weeks early can experience learning difficulties and behavioural problems, and have an elevated risk of heart disease in later life. So it's especially important pregnant women protect themselves from exposure to bushfire smoke. WHY PREGNANT WOMEN ARE AT HIGHER RISK Pregnant women breathe at an increased rate, and their hearts need to work harder than those of non-pregnant people to transport oxygen to the fetus. This makes them particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution, including bushfire smoke. We often measure poor air quality by the presence of ultra-fine particles called PM2.5 (small particles of less than 2.5 micrometres in size). These particles are concerning because they can penetrate into our lungs, and into blood and tissue to cause inflammation throughout the body. Importantly in pregnant women, environmental pollutants can cause inflammatory damage to the placenta's blood supply. This can interfere with the placenta's development and function, which can in turn compromise the growth of the fetus. SPIKES IN PREMATURE BIRTHS AND OTHER RISKS Many studies have linked poor air quality, particularly high PM2.5 levels, to poor pregnancy outcomes. Data from 183 countries showed in 2010, an estimated 2.7 million premature births, 18 per cent of the total, were associated with PM2.5 pollution. A 2019 study of more than 500,000 pregnant women from Colorado looked at the effect of bushfire smoke on pregnancy outcomes. The authors analysed data on air quality, fire incidence and pregnancy and birth records from 2007-2015, during which time Colorado was regularly affected by smoke from fires burning in California and the Pacific Northwest. READ: Commentary: Australian bushfires reveal a national crisis of under-insurance The study found PM2.5 due to bushfire smoke was linked to spikes in premature birth, especially in women exposed during the second trimester. In women exposed to smoke during the \ufb01rst trimester, birth weight was lower than average. Further, exposure during any trimester increased the chance of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. The effects were detectable even with low exposure to smoke and small increases in PM2.5. For every 1 microgram per cubic metres increase in average daily exposure to PM2.5 during the second trimester of pregnancy, the risk of premature birth increased by 13 per cent. READ: Commentary: Air pollution's nasty effects should motivate stronger action but hasn't To put this into context, in Canberra in the first week of January, PM2.5 levels averaged more than 200 micrograms per cubic metre, compared with the typical background concentration of 5 micrograms per cubic metres. Victorian environment authorities classify PM2.5 levels above 25 micrograms per cubic metres as unsafe for vulnerable people. In another large study, a 24 per cent increase in premature birth was seen after 10 micrograms per cubic metres increase in PM2.5. As well as PM2.5, bushfire smoke contains larger PM10 particles, nitric oxides, carbon monoxide and other gases and toxic chemicals. These all have potential to impair lung and heart function in the mother, activate inflammation, and directly affect fetal and placental development. READ: Commentary: We call it climate change. It's more like a global health crisis Air quality is also a factor for couples attempting to conceive or dealing with infertility. Population studies suggest air pollution compromises human fertility by reducing ovarian reserve (the number of eggs in the ovary) and affecting sperm number and movement. Direct exposure to fire, burns and fire retardant chemicals can also negatively impact fertility. PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE IF YOU'RE PREGNANT The best strategy is to reduce smoke exposure as much as possible. Recommendations include staying inside on high-risk days, sealing the house to prevent smoke infiltration and using air conditioning to keep cool. Avoid creating smoke by cigarette smoking, burning candles, or frying and grilling. Use PM2 (N95) masks and air-filtering devices if possible, and avoid exposure to ash, which contains particulate material you can inhale. Pregnant women in a fire region should carefully follow emergency services' direction. It's better to evacuate early, with an emergency supply kit containing clothes, medications, water and food you don't need to cook. Make sure your medication and prenatal vitamins are accessible, continue to take them, and stay well hydrated. Inform authorities and shelters you are pregnant and need to maintain your antenatal care. READ: Commentary: Miscarriages affect 1 in 6 pregnancies - but is rarely caused by anything the mother did Be aware of the signs of premature labour including abdominal cramps or contractions, a heavy vaginal discharge, loss of fluid or vaginal bleeding, pelvic pressure and low backache. Seek help if you think you may be going into labour. Given what we know about the consequences of poor air quality on pregnancy outcomes, it's critical pregnant women are given top priority when it comes to bushfire relief and health care support.

Shane Fitzsimmons, the NSW RFS commissioner, pointed to that death when asked about the fire-induced weather patterns. \"That extraordinary event resulted in cyclonic-type base flipping over a 10-tonne truck. That is the volatility and danger that exists,\" he said. The pyrocumulonimbus clouds are essentially a thunderstorm that forms from the smoke plume of a fire as intense heat from the fire causes air to rise rapidly, drawing in cooler air, according to information from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. As the cloud climbs and then cools in the low temperatures of the upper atmosphere, the collisions of ice particles in the higher parts of the cloud build up an electrical charge, which can be released as lightning. These can cause dangerous and unpredictable changes in fire behaviour, making them harder to fight as well as causing lightning strikes that could ignite new fires. The rising air also spurs intense updrafts that suck in so much air that strong winds develop, causing a fire to burn hotter and spread further. - Reuters/ic</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 53, "title": "Commentary: The Australian bushfires are straining emergency disaster volunteers", "published": "2020-01-11", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">SYDNEY: Australia is in the midst of inconceivably bad bushfires.

Although expensive, the cost of not acting on disaster risk, planning and preparation will be greatly outstripped by the cost of future climate and weather catastrophes. DISASTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM NEEDS UPGRADING The states and territories are primarily responsible for disaster preparedness and response. Typically, the federal government has no direct responsibility, but lends a hand when asked through a variety of programmes, policies and initiatives. This may have worked in the past. But with ever larger and more complex disasters, these arrangements are no longer fit for purpose. Australia's national emergency management workforce is largely made up of volunteers, who are stretched to the bone, exhausted and some say, under-resourced. What's more, experts led by former Fire and Rescue New South Wales (NSW) commissioner Greg Mullins have called for significant changes in Australia's disaster management preparedness and response. They've signalled the need for new resources, policies and processes to tackle more frequent and complex disasters. We've also seen how consultation and collaboration between Australia's federal and state governments are not working smoothly. NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons only learned that Defence reservists would be deployed when it was reported in the media. And it wasn't immediately clear how new reservists would be integrated into existing response activities. FINDING A BIPARTISAN WAY FORWARD The decade-long ideological battle between the left and right of Australian politics has paralysed climate policy development. This cannot continue. Well-funded disaster preparedness and response inevitably builds resilience to climate change and extreme weather events like bushfires. This is something both sides of politics agree on - in fact, it was noted in the federal government's own recent report profiling our vulnerability to disasters and climate change. READ: Commentary: Bushfires in Australia and adapting holidays to a hotter, drier world Aside from needing bipartisanship, an overhaul of Australia's disaster management will require money. While Australia is lucky to have a dedicated, paid and exceptional set of state and territory disaster and emergency management agencies such as the NSW Rural Fire Service, most heavy lifting is done by agency volunteers. But with fire seasons starting earlier and lasting longer, we can no longer rely for months at a time on volunteers who must also work, pay their bills and feed their families. We need a larger, paid, trained, professional emergency management workforce. I reject claims that such a workforce would stand idle most of the year. Severe weather seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer, so these professionals will be busy. The workforce could be divided in to areas of expertise to tackle specific disaster types, and focus on different aspects of the disaster cycle such as prevention and preparation. These continue year-round. Alternatively, volunteers could be compensated through direct payments for lost income, tax offsets for volunteers and their employers, or rent or mortgage assistance. READ: Commentary: How data-sharing by Big Tech can save lives in disasters, solve new problems What's more, a new national disaster management approach must intersect with state and local governments to help reduce disaster risk. These might include contributing to land-use zoning plans, building design and standards for construction in at-risk areas, or building partnerships with the private sector. FUNDING DISASTER PREPAREDNESS All this will cost money. Australia must accept that taxpayers will pay for future disaster preparedness, response and recovery. We need a bucket of cash for when disasters strike. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced A$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) for recovery, but disaster funds should be ongoing. This would be no different to the national Medical Future Research Fund - a A$20 billion fund to focus on solving nationally important medical issues funded through savings from the health budget. There are several ways the money could be gathered. Commonwealth, state and territory governments could rethink their insistence on achieving budget surpluses, and instead spend money on a disaster fund. A \"disaster levy\" could be applied to household rates bills, a tax on carbon introduced, or planned tax cuts for middle and high income earners abandoned. The public could also contribute to the fund directly. The ABC's recent Australia Talks survey found on average, Australians would be willing to chip in A$200 each per year to pay for adaptation to climate change. READ: Commentary: How effectively can Singapore adapt to sea level rise? If every Australian contributed, there's another A$5 billion per year for the fund. Future disaster management will require Australia to step up. It means making hard choices about what we want the future to be like, how we'll pay for that, and what level of risk we are prepared to tolerate. It also means demanding that our leaders deliver meaningful climate change adaptation, including disaster planning.

The consequences could last decades", "published": "2020-01-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">SYDNEY: Bushfires pose serious short- and long-term impacts to public drinking water quality. They can damage water supply infrastructure and water catchments, impeding the treatment processes that normally make our water safe to drink. Several areas in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria have already been issued with warnings about the quality of their drinking water. SHORT-TERM RISKS Bushfires can damage or disrupt water supply infrastructure as they burn. </p><p>And the risks can persist after the fires are out. A loss of power, for example, disables important water treatment processes such as chlorine disinfection, needed to kill microorganisms and make our water safe to drink. Drinking water for the towns of Eden and Boydtown on the NSW south coast has been affected in this way over recent days. Residents have been advised to boil their water before drinking it and using it for cooking, teeth brushing, and so on. READ: Australia issues new evacuation alerts as monster bushfires regenerate Other towns including Cobargo and Bermagui received similar warnings on New Year's Eve. In some cases, untreated water, straight from a river supply, may be fed directly into drinking water systems. Water treatment plants are bypassed completely, due to damage, power loss, or an inability to keep pace with high volumes of water required for firefighting. We've seen this in a number of southern NSW towns this week including Batlow, Adelong, Tumbarumba, and the southern region of Eurobodalla Council, stretching from Moruya to Tilba. Residents of these areas have also been urged to boil their drinking water. READ: Commentary: Australian bushfires reveal a national crisis of under-insurance Untreated river water, or river water which has not been properly disinfected with chlorine, is usually not safe for drinking in Australia. Various types of bacteria, as well as the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium, could be in such water. Animals including cattle, birds and kangaroos can excrete these microorganisms into river water. Septic tanks and sewage treatment plants may also discharge effluents into waterways, adding harmful microorganisms. Human infection with these microorganisms can cause a range of illnesses, including gastrointestinal diseases with symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting. LONG-TERM RISKS Bushfires can damage drinking water catchments, which can lead to longer term threats to drinking water. Drinking water catchments are typically forested areas, and so are vulnerable to bushfire damage. Severe impacts to waterways may not occur until after intense rainfall. Heavy rain can wash ash and eroded soil from the fires into waterways, affecting drinking water supplies downstream. For example, bushfire ash contains nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Increased nutrient concentrations can stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria, commonly known as \"blue-green algae\". READ: Australian authorities warn bushfire reprieve will be over soon Cyanobacteria produce chemicals which may cause a range of water quality problems, including poor taste and odour. Some cyanobacteria can produce toxic chemicals, requiring very careful management to protect treated drinking water. Many water treatment plants include filtration processes to filter small suspended particles from the water. But an increase in suspended particles, like that which we see after bushfires, would challenge most filtration plants. The suspended particles would be removed, but they would clog the filters, requiring them to be more frequently pulled from normal operation and cleaned. This cleaning, or backwashing, is a normal part of the treatment process. But if more time must be spent backwashing, that's less time the filters are working to produce drinking water. And if the rate of drinking water filtration is slowed and fails to keep pace with demand, authorities may place limitations on water use. BOILING WATER NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH In order to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal and other illnesses, water suppliers and health departments may issue a boil water alert, as we've seen in the past week. Bringing water to a \"rolling boil\" can reliably kill most of the microorganisms of concern. In cases where water may be contaminated with chemical substances rather than microorganisms, boiling is usually not effective. So where there's a risk of chemical contamination, public health messages are usually \"do not drink tap water\". This means bottled water only. Such \"do not drink\" alerts were issued this week following bushfire impacts to water treatment plants supplying the Victorian towns of Buchan and Omeo. Impacts to catchments from bushfires and subsequent erosion can have long-lasting effects, potentially worsening untreated drinking water quality for many years, even decades. Following these bushfires, many water treatment plant operators and catchment managers will need to adapt to changed conditions and brace for more extreme weather events in the future.

The warning from the world's biggest miner underscores how an unusually long bushfire season that has scorched an area one-third the size of Germany is damaging the world's No. 14 economy. Australia's tourism and insurance industries have already foreshadowed they face a AUS$1 billion (\u00a3528.76 million) hit each from the fires. \"Smoke from regional bushfires and dust have reduced air quality at our operations, which has impacted December 2019 production,\" BHP said in a trading update, referring to its energy coal plants in New South Wales state where hundreds of fires have raged. </p><p>\"If air quality continues to deteriorate then operations could be constrained further in the second half of the year,\" it added. The fires have killed 29 people and millions of animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and razed 11 million hectares of wilderness since September. Even with thunderstorms and rain in recent days, scores of fires are still burning on the east coast. The disruption has extended to the capital, Canberra, and its two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, all of which have been repeatedly blanketed in thick smoke that has earned them air quality ratings among the worst in the world. Last week, a tennis player collapsed during a qualifying round at the Australian Open tournament in Melbourne due to inhaling bushfire smoke, although the competition has continued in more moderate weather this week. The Bureau of Meteorology forecast rising temperatures in the state of Victoria on Wednesday, combined with strong winds, creating a new risk of bushfires. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service issued a high fire danger rating for Tuesday on the state's south coast. The NSW state government, meanwhile, said it was increasing a grant for primary producers affected by the fires to AUS$75,000, from AUS$15,000 previously. \"Putting money back in people's pockets as soon as possible will allow affected communities to focus on rebuilding and repairing crucial infrastructure, treating, euthanising or burying livestock, as well as buying much-needed fodder,\" said Minister for Agriculture Adam Marshall. Here are key events in the bushfire crisis: * Early on Tuesday, 86 fires were burning across New South Wales, none above the lowest warning level. There were 27 emergency warnings in Victoria, including one flash flood warning. * The Bureau of Meteorology warned the East Gippsland region to expect strong winds after thunderstorms rolled through a day earlier. Earlier this month, people in East Gippsland were evacuated by Navy ships as bushfires destroyed whole towns. * The Australian Open tennis tournament continues in Melbourne.

The fires have swept through major dairy areas along the New South Wales south coast, where many producers have faced a three-year drought, and East Gippsland in Victoria. Bushfire-affected regions account for about a third of the country's milk output, data from industry group Dairy Australia shows. \"It isn't yet possible to get a full picture,\" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness analyst, National Australia Bank. \"Hundreds, perhaps thousands of cattle will have been lost. We have to wait for the full assessment but the impact will be devastating.\" Australia is the world's seventh-largest dairy exporter, supplying mainly Asian markets with products such as fresh milk, butter and cheese, as well as milk powder. Dairy is the country's fourth-biggest rural industry, worth A$3.3 billion (US$2.3 billion), according to government figures. Even before the fires, Australia's milk production was set to fall to a 22-year low due to drought, according to country's chief commodity forecaster, leaving processors scrambling for sufficient supplies to meet demand. \"The processors were already under pressure beforehand as Australian milk production falls,\" said Michael Harvey, a dairy analyst at Rabobank. Many farmers are now struggling to secure feed for their cattle, which could affect both milk production and breeding. \"Many roads are closed so we can't get fodder to farmers who need feed,\" said Paul Mumford, a dairy farmer in Won Wron, 210 km east of Melbourne. \"The fires have primarily killed the youngest in the herd. It will take years to rebuild,\" he added. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday nearly 4,000 livestock had been killed by the fires.

Already more than 1,500 homes have been destroyed - with months still to go in the bushfire season. Compare this to 2009, when Victoria's \"Black Saturday\" fires claimed more than 2,000 homes in February, or 1983, when the \"Ash Wednesday\" fires destroyed about 2,400 homes in Victoria and South Australia, also in February. The 2020 fire season could end up surpassing these tragedies, despite the lessons learned and improvements in preparedness. </p><p>READ: Australia fires: RSAF Chinooks to bring relief supplies, help with evacuation One lesson not really learned, though, is that home insurance is rarely sufficient to enable recovery. The evidence is many people losing their homes will find themselves unable to rebuild, due to lack of insurance. We know this from interviews with those affected by the October 2013 Blue Mountains bushfires (in which almost 200 homes were destroyed). Despite past disasters, more than 65 per cent of households affected were underinsured. Research published by the Victorian government in 2017, meanwhile, estimated just 46 per cent Victorian households have enough insurance to recover from a disaster, with 28 per cent underinsured and 26 per cent having no insurance. The consequences aren't just personal. They potentially harm local communities permanently, as those unable to rebuild move away. Communities lose the vital knowledge and social networks that make them resilient to disaster. MISCALCULATING REBUILDING COSTS All too often the disaster of having your home and possessions razed by fire is followed by the disaster of realising by how much you are underinsured. As researchers into the impact of fires, we are interested why people find themselves underinsured. Our research, which includes interviewing those who have have lost their homes, shows it is complicated, and not necessarily due to negligence. READ: Australia prepares for renewed bushfire threat as economic costs mount READ: Commentary: Bushfires in Australia and adapting holidays to a hotter, drier world For example, a woman who lost her home in Kinglake, northeast of Melbourne, in the 2009 fires, told us how her insurance calculations turned out to bear no resemblance to the actual cost of rebuilding. \"You think okay, this is what I paid for the property,\" she said. \"I think we had about A$550,000 (US$380,000) on the house, and the contents was maybe A$120,000.\" It was on these estimates that she and her partner took out insurance. She told us: You think sure, yeah, I can rebuild my life with that much money. But nowhere near. Not even close. We wound up with a A$700,000 mortgage at the end of rebuilding. AN EXTRA MORTGAGE A common issue is that people insure based on their home's market value. But rebuilding is often more expensive. For one thing there's the need to comply with new building codes, which have been improved to ensure buildings take into account their potential exposure to bushfire. This is likely to increase costs by 20 per cent or more, but is rarely made clear to insurance customers. READ: Australian bushfire cloud visible in Chile and Argentina Construction costs also often spike following disasters, due to extra demand for building services and materials. A further contributing factor is that banks can claim insurance payments to pay off mortgages, meaning the only way to rebuild is by taking out another mortgage. \"People who owned houses, any money that was owing, everything was taken back to the bank before they could do anything else,\" said a former shop owner from Whittlesea (about 30km west of Kinglake and also severely hit by the 2009 fires). This meant, once banks were paid, people had nothing left to restart. She told us: People came into the shop and cried on my shoulder, and I cried with them. I helped them all I could there. That's probably why we lost the business, because how can you ask people to pay when they've got nothing? UNDERMINING SOCIAL COHESION In rural areas there is often a shortage of rental properties. Insurance companies generally only cover rent for 12 months, which is not enough time to rebuild. For families forced to relocate, moving back can feel disruptive to their recovery. Under-insurance significantly increases the chances those who lose their homes will move away and never return - hampering social recovery and resilience. Residents that cannot afford to rebuild will sell their property, with \"tree changers\" the most likely buyers. Communities not only lose residents with local knowledge and important skills but also social cohesion. Research in both Australia and the United States suggested this can leave those communities less prepared for future disasters. This is because a sense of community is vital to individuals' willingness and ability to prepare for and act in a threat situation. A confidence that others will weigh in to help in turn increases people's confidence and ability to prepare and act. In Whittlesea, for example, residents reported a change in their sense of community cohesion after the Black Saturday fires. \"The newer people coming in,\" one interviewee told us, \"aren't invested like the older people are in the community.\" Australia is one of the few wealthy countries that heavily relies on insurance markets for recovery from disasters. But the evidence suggests this is an increasingly fraught strategy, particularly when rural communities also have to cope with the reality of more intense and frequent extreme weather events. If communities are to recover from bushfires, the nation cannot put its trust in individual insurance policies. What's required is national policy reform to ensure effective disaster preparedness and recovery for all.

His dog is safe and so is a small jar of soil, collected from his grandfather's vineyards. \"It's a bit silly. But these are the things that matter,\" he says. The winemaker in the Snowy Valley of New South Wales has lost a lot over the past few weeks. </p><p>The region has been punished by a devastating bushfire season that has had local communities on edge, and under siege, for weeks. Tumbarumba, a historic timber town, found itself wedged between two large fire fronts that slowly but destructively merged together into a mega fire that on Monday (Jan 20) was still more than 332,100 hectares in size and uncontrolled. Brayne's 10-hectare vineyards are just a small fraction of the vast swathes of bushland and forest - as well as more than local 100 homes - that have burned since the blaze ignited last month. But for the 35-year-old, the personal loss is shattering. \"It ripped up the back of the farm, came through, took out my house and then pushed at the winery. Basically any equipment that wasn't in the main building is gone. All my possessions, the house, it's all gone up,\" he said. The gentle hills of eucalypts that surround his vineyards now resemble a crude and blackened moonscape. The fire came through with such intensity and heat that Brayne's tractors have been left as piles of melted metal. \"The vineyard is heavily fire impacted to the point of being unsalvageable. To resurrect this is to start again, replant and go from there. It's about five years for this site to be back to reproduction,\" he said. Brayne's operation - called Obsession Wines - is boutique. He is one of a handful of cool climate growers in the area, producing and cellaring a variety of grape varieties, uniquely including tempranillo. Many of the vines on the property were planted in the early 1990s but have been completely destroyed. He predicts that he has been left with only about five per cent of his crop. Promising harvests of chardonnay, pinot gris, viognier, and pinot noir planned for February are no more. \"Things were looking really good actually. We'd put a lot more work into here. It was a lot of time, a lot of money and a lot of love that's gone into the site. And to have it ripped out like that, it's pretty hard to take.\" Official wine industry groups have been at pains to emphasise the limited impact of bushfires and residual smoke on Australia's wine production. But while only a small fraction of the country's vineyards have been impacted, those affected have been hit hard. In the Adelaide Hills, a premier wine growing area, bushfires in late December have left many growers reeling. In one night, about one-third of the entire region's vineyards - approximately 1,000 hectares - were hit as some 200 different fires burnt across South Australia. \"Some individuals, businesses and communities have suffered dreadful losses and this must not be downplayed. However, the actual fire footprint to date covers less than one per cent of the total vineyard area in Australia,\" a spokesperson from Wines Australia, a government body responsible for wine research and development, exports and marketing. \"The extended exposure to smoke is a concern - however the geographic spread of the wine sector means that while some areas have been affected the majority has not. Even though smoke haze looks and smells bad, the greater risk to vineyards comes from fresh smoke close to a fire,\" the spokesperson said. Grape growers throughout fire affected areas will be encouraged to have their grapes tested for smoke exposure before they are used for winemaking. But the process is currently lengthy, expensive and comes late in the season for growers, leading to potentially long periods of uncertainty before their grapes can be passed as useable. Smoke taint is damaging; the cost to the industry is assessed at about US$275 million since 2003, according to Wines Australia. \"Laboratories are already braced for an unprecedented level of testing,\" the spokesperson said. Vineyards like Cathy Gairn's Courabyra Wines in Tumbarumba are among those unclear about this season's harvest. A \"beast of a fire\" forced Gairn and her husband to evacuate their property, but the flames skirted the fringes of their property, only scorching fruit on the perimeter of the 27-year-old plantation. \"The fire was coming right over the back and we could see it coming. It was pretty horrific actually. I am absolutely terrified of fires and when we saw that coming I panicked a little bit,\" she said. \"We don't know if we'll even pick anything this year. We're hoping. Our income has been greatly affected. We've got 10 staff who are all out of work at the moment. \"That's going to be a long road back for us.\" The worsening effects of climate change have also posed extra challenges to those in the industry; trying to reestablish vines throughout a prolonged drought will be tough. \"If we're in drought, the whole country is just about buggered,\" Gairn said. \"We've had good irrigation so our wines are good at this stage but in the future, who knows. Water supply is getting harder and harder.\" While the federal government has pledged some financial support and mental counselling to those affected, growers like Adrian Brayne says it is local communities, under strain but in solidarity, that are helping ease the burdens for now. \"We've all had losses of various degrees but there's always someone that's had it worse than you,\" he said. \"Everyone is so generous and we're all about that. Because without a community, why have a business?\" A proud man, he says having to reach out for help - for even the most basic items - has been one of the most difficult obstacles of this episode. He has no home right now and sleeps on a couch with a blanket inside his winery building. \"I'm not one to ask for help. To ask for a handout is pretty tough and probably the hardest thing was going into one of the disaster centres to get a shirt on my back. I didn't think I'd experience that in my life. \"Not having a place, not having a sense of going home. That's a hard one.\" Communities right through the Snowy Valley are hurting, with industry, agriculture and tourism coming to an abject halt. The fire threat continues to hang over to an exhausted population. But when safety and some normality returns to what is a spectacular part of the country, locals hope visitors will too. \"As soon as the people can come in, come. Come spend money in the town, experience what's here. The biggest thing is the air. It's so fresh and clean. It's a beautiful part of the world,\" Brayne said. As he speaks, rain starts to steadily fall on the ashen fire ground. It is a small moment to savour after weeks of pain. He looks to the skies, smiling. \"That's unreal.\"</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 9, "title": "Australia seen waiting till March for sustained rains to douse bushfires", "published": "2020-01-16", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">SYDNEY: Australia will have to wait until March for rains heavy enough to bring sustained relief from dry weather that has fuelled deadly bushfires, the country's weather bureau said on Thursday (Jan 16).

At the same time, Rachel Yeo drove her car in the opposite direction - towards the inferno. The 31-year-old Singaporean ignored the emergency evacuation instructions issued by fire authorities on New Year's Eve, as an out of control bushfire threatened to overwhelm the community. Instead she went to work - at the Mogo Wildlife Park where she would spend a harrowing day trying to save the zoo's animals from the unfolding disaster. \"The first thing I thought of was to come to the zoo and check on the animals. </p><p>I had to make sure they were safe and that was just my priority,\" she said. \"It was the loneliest car drive of my life because as I was driving to the zoo, everyone else was driving the opposite direction. \"We were basically bracing ourselves for the approaching fire.

And there was so much tension in the air and just a lot of nerves going,\" she said. Mogo Wildlife Park is home to about 200 animals, including lions, giraffes, zebras and rhinos. Many were either too large or too dangerous to evacuate safely. While the staff did all they could to protect, shelter and prepare them, they were vulnerable to the unprecedented fury of the fire, which would eventually destroy more than 176 houses and kill two people in Mogo, a devastating loss in a town of little more than 300. READ: Australian bushfire cloud visible in Chile and Argentina READ: Bushfires bring fears of 'new normal' to life Down Under This fire is just one of many which have devastated many parts of Australia in recent weeks, destroying vast areas of bush and laying waste to entire communities. Yeo had only joined the zoo's team in early December. Still, she treated the animals - particularly the primates she cares for on a daily basis - like family. \"We have such a bond with our animals. It's not a meerkat, it's not a gibbon, it's a friend of ours. We're very personal with them. They can't get out of this. We're not going to let them suffer.\" READ: Wildlife ravaged by Australia fires could take decades to recover READ: Australian animals face extinction threat as bushfire toll mounts She and a group of 14 other staff positioned themselves around the zoo and prepared themselves for a fight against the flames. As spot fires broke out, they extinguished them - at one point a blaze began on the complex's gibbon island, forcing the staff into desperate action to put it out. As day appeared to turn to night in the heavy smoke, even the zoo's director Chad Staples, who had made the protection preparations in the event of a fire threat, began to fear the worst. The park was cornered. \"I never knew that anything could be like that. There were about three hours when it was at its worst. Watching the fire roll in ... it was pretty full on,\" he told CNA. \"I cannot explain how terrifying it was,\" Yeo said. \"The smoke, the ash, the debris, the winds swept it all up and it felt like a blizzard. It felt like midnight at 10am. The feeling was like, you felt all alone. It was indescribable. \"Every biological instinct tells you to run. I can only imagine what the animals were going through.\" Eventually as a wind change swept through, the danger was finally averted. The Mogo staff had managed to prevent damage to the zoo, as well as keeping every single animal out of harm's way.

The consequences could last decades While the good outcome for the zoo was widely celebrated, the destruction of many parts of the historic town, and large swathes of the south coast region, has left the community reeling. The summer period is essential for the local tourism business. \"We can now be at the front of getting people to come back to the south coast of NSW. This is the busy time. People are going to hurt from this. This is something that's going to hurt for a long time,\" Staples said. And while the zoo's animals were safe, wild creatures left to fend for themselves in the inferno suffered huge losses. The staff's veterinarians have been tending to injured wildlife since the fire came through. \"It's an understatement to say it's devastating. I have cried over just the thought of so many animals being lost. So much area has been lost and the ones that are still alive are starving because they've lost their homes, they've lost all their food,\" Yeo said. A GoFundMe page was started to assist the zoo in the aftermath of the disaster, and has raised more than US$60,000 so far. Staples says the money will be used to establish a veterinary hospital to treat the vast numbers of wild animals that are \"injured, sick, dying, starving\". He also plans to help regrow trees in the surrounding area to assist wildlife left without their natural habitat. Yeo's \"trial by fire\", as she describes it, was not the way she thought her first working month in Mogo would go.

Morrison is under intense pressure for his government's handing of a bushfire crisis that has killed 29 people and millions of animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and razed 11 million hectares of wilderness - an area one-third the size of Germany. The scores of fires follow three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change, but Morrison said late on Tuesday (Jan 21) that his critics are too focussed on carbon emissions. \"Hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season,\" Morrison told Sky News Australia. Australia is one of the largest carbon emitters per capita due to its reliance on coal-fired power plants, and Morrison is a firm supporter of the industry.

By family, he means giraffes, rhinos, lions and gorillas among the 200 residents of Mogo Zoo, which he and 15 staff battled to defend last week from raging bushfires that ravaged dozens of homes and vehicles across the tiny tourist town on New Year's Eve. When they knew the fires were coming, Staples and his team made a plan to keep flames at bay and save the 26.3 hectare private zoo and its 40 species, including shifting some primates into their own living quarters.

At Mogo Zoo, staff spent New Year's Eve dousing the grounds with hundreds of thousands of litres of water as the fires approached, shifting quickly as winds changed. Flaming trees collapsed close to animal enclosures as the fire jumped over a stream on two sides of the grounds. The sky turned red and Mogo was in darkness by noon, Staples said. A local fire service official stopped by at the zoo and told them no one would be able to come rescue them.

Volunteers and veterinarians tend to the animals, all victims of damaging bushfires that swept through South Australia in late December. This makeshift emergency triage centre for wounded koalas has been a site of both tears and triumph over the past few weeks. Death has never been far away as the team at Adelaide Koala Rescue (AKR) has responded to hundreds of calls to help animals burnt, displaced and starving as a result of the fires. But for dozens of the koalas left here now, home is calling. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqAB9kt4ZB4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqAB9kt4ZB4</url> There have been staggering losses to Australia's wildlife this summer, as bushfires ripped through more than 10 million hectares of land. Experts predict that some 1.25 billion animals, including mammals, birds and reptiles, have been killed nationwide. The number reaches into the trillions when insects and other invertebrates, all essential to delicate ecosystems, are counted. And still, the blazes rage. READ: Australia's bushfire danger returns as Sydney faces scorching heat While the casualty rates and long term impact on the environment are hard to fathom, those working tirelessly to save and recuperate the survivors have been left holding onto small positives. For AKR, it comes in the form of paper signs at the entrance to their triage centre. On it is listed the names of all of the koalas who have successfully \"graduated\" back to the wild. Each of them - like Spud and Janet and Alice Cooper - is a \"cause for celebration\", according to director Jane Brister. \"I think more than anything, it's important for the morale for our volunteers,\" she said. \"It's been a really traumatic time for a lot of the team members, especially the ones that go out in the field. I've certainly seen things that I can't unsee.\" READ: 'A long road back from here': Small winemakers feel the pain of Australian bushfires Brister estimates that AKR has retrieved more than 300 koalas from scorched areas within the past three weeks, and cared for up to 120 wild animals at any one time. Each animal has different medical treatment needs - from burnt paws to singed ears and dehydration - but all of them require housing, food and a bit of love, during what is a traumatic and confusing period. \"What people love about them the most and what upsets people the most when it comes to bushfires is their innocence and their vulnerability. They can't fly away, they can't run away,\" she said. \"They're stuck there up a tree and they're really defenceless. They have to rely on us to fight for them, to fight for their habitat and I think that's in part what makes them so endearing.\" Despite the easing of the worst fire conditions in South Australia, here and right across bushfire affected areas, finding relocation refuges for rehabilitated or dislocated wildlife is proving to be a difficult challenge. For those survivors hanging on in burnt out areas, the situation is desperate too. READ: 'The most terrifying day of my life': Singaporean zookeeper at centre of dramatic animal rescue during Australia bushfires 'THEY'RE ALL BASICALLY GONE' In Majors Creek, a small rural community close to Canberra, Bill Waterhouse and his wife Lesley run a wombat refuge, which has quickly transformed into a rescue operation for a menagerie of wildlife. \"This morning a little baby wombat was brought to us, I was called out for a kangaroo hanging in a fence and on the way home I brought home a magpie,\" Waterhouse said. The couple have been responding to rescue requests since bushfires reared up in their area in early December. The danger has not passed and they constantly live in fear of another evacuation from their property, which is home to several injured animals. \"We feel like we're under siege, personally here, but we also feel like all the animals we've cared about for so many years are now being burnt to death and now our release sites and their carers are under attack,\" he said. \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't feeling a sense of anguish about it.\" READ: Forget a 'new normal': Experts say Australia's worst bushfires still lie ahead Local areas that used to be safe havens for the animals they released back into the wild are now affected by fire. There are few safe places left. On the back of donations, Waterhouse is attempting to mobilise local landowners to try and provide much needed food on the edges of the fireground where wild animals are coming to scavenge. But he has been left saddened by the lack of animals that appear to be in need of help. \"There have been very few animals brought to us, burnt or not. In general, with the amount of damage that's taken place, we were expecting many more but it's been so hot and so devastating that they're all basically gone,\" he said. \"We think the animals are increasingly going to be hungry, they'll be desperate. There's no flowers out there, there are no leaves, there are no nests. \"The canopy, if it wasn't burnt, it was scorched. You really notice the silence. The habitat's had it.

With electricity still out in the area, the heat pads used to keep the small creatures warm are not working. Little Jack, as he has been dubbed, was found in the pouch of his dead mother, who had been struck by a car, a common accident during this period of prolonged drought and fire. \"The nature of the road is it's warm and water runs off it. So there's almost always a little bit of greenery on the roadside and animals are drawn to it,\" Waterhouse said. \"He's a little pinkie and has no fur yet. He's the size of a sweet potato with little legs and wriggly bits. It has a very good chance of surviving all the way through. It's a two year program for him.\" Waterhouse and other rescuers are bracing for the long haul care of wildlife amid the widespread habitat destruction. But while koalas, wombats and other generalist Australian species will inevitably bounce back, there are greater fears that lesser known, critically threatened species may have already been lost. READ: Thousands evacuated from Australian tourist haven as bushfires rage FACING EXTINCTION Analysis by the Australian Department of Environment and Energy shows that 49 threatened species have had more than 80 per cent of their likely or known distribution area affected by fire. A further 65 species have had at least half of their habitats burnt. \"If the habitat of those species is removed, then there are real fears for whether they can persist. These would be species extinctions, things that occur here uniquely that won't occur anymore,\" said Chris Dickman, a professor of ecology at the University of Sydney. \"It's clearly a really emotional time for anyone associated with the native fauna. It's awful to see the pictures and it's awful to know there's a whole lot more behind them,\" he added. READ: Koalas, native animals rescued from flash floods as rain pours over Australia bushfire Prof Dickman says while iconic, charismatic animals are important for raising awareness about the damage to natural environments, there are many, many others that are essential to ecosystem balance that have suffered major losses. \"It may be ecologically important species that carry out functions like pollination or moving seeds around in the forest environment, or are important because they move fungal spores, or digging the topsoil. If these are lost, then it means the ability of the forest ecosystem to regenerate in the future will be slowed down or compromised,\" he said. But the Australian bush is known to be resilient and he says in some areas, especially if rain has fallen, the recovery of habitats could be \"rapid\". The federal government has pledged A$50 million (US$34m) for a Wildlife and Habitat Recovery Package that will be used to try to prevent species extinction and enable the work of local wildlife rescuers. But opposition figures, like Senator Mehreen Faruqi from the Australian Greens, says that money \"is just a drop in the ocean\". \"Really what we need at this time is an open chequebook from the government because that is the only thing that will ensure the survival of our species and our native species into the future,\" she said. \"Wildlife carers have been working around the clock to save the animals, to protect the animals and to rehabilitate animals but you know this is really expensive work, it is time consuming work and it is absolutely emotionally draining work.\" READ: Threatened species hit hard by Australia's bushfires The tired eyes of the volunteers at the koala triage centre are testament to the fatigue and stress inflicted upon them these past weeks.

This year, Eden is anything but a paradise for Baxter and other business owners on the town's smoke-filled main street. Just days after the entire town, including tourists, was evacuated in the face of fierce wildfires, most shops remained shuttered. Dead birds and burnt leaves littered the beachfront. </p><p>\"It's a seasonal town,\" Baxter told Reuters from behind the counter of her shop, adding that income was down 85 to 90 per cent. \"This money, through this time of year, gets us through winter and we don't have it now.

Weeks into the crisis, the economic costs are mounting, potentially wrecking the central bank's hopes for a \"gentle turning point\" of renewed growth in gross domestic product this quarter. \"The fires have come at a time when there was already a lot of uncertainty about Australia's economic outlook,\" AMP's Sydney-based head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said in a telephone interview. Oliver estimated a minimum 0.4 per cent hit on gross domestic product (GDP) in the March quarter, which could mean growth stalled completely in the period and prompt a further interest rate cut as early as February. \"The impact on tourism is expected to be more lasting while the impact on consumer spending is the biggest unknown,\" Oliver said. Australia's AUS$1.95 trillion economy is already limping after 28 years of recession-free expansion as cash-strapped consumers shun everything from clothes to cars while a three-year drought has hurt the farm sector.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he expected the full economic impact of the fires to be \"very significant\". \"All those businesses in those communities who have been impacted, been hit at exactly the wrong time of the year, when they're the busiest time,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. SMOKE ON THE WATERFRONT In Eden, the reopening of the town following the weekend evacuation and the fact that it escaped any major fire damage has made little difference to businesses. At least two cruise ships have bypassed the port in the past week as smoke blankets the waterfront. Eric Wolske moved to the town with his partner two years ago, buying an antiques shop as an investment. \"Well compared to last year this time, business obviously is down,\" Wolske told Reuters, adding he was banking on a cruise ship due to berth later this month. Tourism accounts for more than 3per cent of Australia's annual GDP and many hotels and resorts have suffered extensive damage, while many national parks are closed. In the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra the smoke has dented the country's clean and green image and led to the cancellation of some entertainment events. Agricultural businesses have also been affected, with the sizeable dairy industry struggling to secure milk supplies. Insurers have received 8,985 bushfire-related claims in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland since Nov 8. The claims are estimated to have a loss value of AUS$700 million.

If policy and politics are about managing competing interests and prioritising different constituencies, the varied national COVID-19 responses point to the acute challenges of getting this balance right. How do we balance the economic implications of movement restrictions against the public health risks of increased infections? How do we weigh individual freedoms against community protection?</p><p> And if we shut down elements of our economy, do we protect affected people and businesses? All of them? How much support should we give them? And for how long? LISTEN: The COVID-19 vaccine will be the biggest product launch in history. Can we pull it off? READ: Commentary: More bold measures needed to protect against the job losses heading Singapore's way Almost every country has answered these questions differently, with measures ranging from total lockdown to contact tracing, widespread testing to business as usual. These have seen varying degrees of success, of course, and varying degrees of public support for those measures. There has been consistent and robust debate about policies enacted in many countries, including movement restrictions and the closure of schools, borders and businesses. Who would want to be a policymaker trying to get this balance right, and trying to sell it politically? Climate change, however, makes the policy and political challenge of responding to COVID-19 look like a picnic, by comparison. In at least five ways, climate change is much tougher. 1. WORST-CASE SCENARIO UNCLEAR With COVID-19, the public has a sense of what a worst-case scenario looks like. It makes justifying extraordinary measures a lot easier for politicians if they can, for example, point to dramatic scenes from a country hit hard by the pandemic to say: \"These are people and societies much like ours, and that's our future if we do nothing.\" The same is more difficult to say of climate change - or at least with any degree of certainty. We can point to the devastating effects of disasters like the 2019 to 2020 Australian bushfires or the drought that preceded it. We know that climate change means an increase in the frequency and severity of such events. But we can't definitively say that climate change caused these disasters - and plenty of voices contest any attempt to link them. The threat of climate change in this sense is a different one, and emergency measures are just a bit harder to sell. READ: Commentary: This new Ministry of Sustainability and Environment looks pretty promising 2. A SUITE OF POSSIBLE MEASURES With COVID-19, we have a clearer idea about the effectiveness of different responses. We can see from other states - and from sophisticated modelling - what measures will lead towards what range of outcomes, and in what timeframe. The same does not apply to climate change. Ecosystem functions are far more complex, and the suite of possible measures - from mitigation to adaptation to geoengineering - make this a much more complicated policy challenge. READ: Commentary: The wonder of clear skies and returning wildlife is our new climate problem 3. UNILATERAL ACTION INSUFFICIENT With COVID-19, unilateral national action can work. Quickly closing off borders is actually possible, and if New Zealand's experience is anything to go by, can be effective. With climate change, the nature of the atmosphere as a global commons obviously makes such actions impossible. We can focus on adaptive measures to try to insulate ourselves from the effects of climate change, but we can't prevent disasters from happening in the first place. So we need mitigation, but one country can't achieve necessary goals on its own. We need sustained international cooperation, with many states doing their part - which has proved to be elusive in practice. READ: Commentary: The coronavirus could take climate action with it And if we think - or we're led to think - that others aren't doing their part for international response, major domestic mitigation efforts are that much harder to sell domestically. 4. OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND With COVID-19, we're protecting ourselves and those closest to us. COVID-19 can immediately and directly affect us, family members and fellow citizens, which is how extraordinary policy measures can be justified and sold. Those most immediately and directly vulnerable to climate change, though, are seen as something other - they're people in the developing world, other living creatures, or future human generations. We're seldom encouraged to orient our moral - or political - concerns to these constituencies. Again, this makes mobilising and sustaining extraordinary measures harder than with COVID-19. READ: Commentary: We have much to learn from COVID-19 and the lockdowns 5. NO 'FOR NOW' SACRIFICES A return to something approaching life as normal beyond COVID-19 seems possible. Sacrifices are politically easier to sell if it looks like a \"for now\" scenario, with effective measures in place and the chance of a vaccine on the horizon. That won't be the case with climate, where we'll likely be facing a world that has changed irrevocably. READ: Commentary: Rising temperatures, fires and floods highlight importance of understanding weather extremes A MORE PROFOUND CHALLENGE In all these ways, climate change poses more profound challenges for policy and politics than COVID-19. That's even assuming that policymakers have the political will to try to address climate change. More positively, what the COVID-19 experience tells us is that the public and policymakers have a capacity to listen to and follow the guidance of experts. We seem to recognise that prevention is much better than cure. And when we recognise an issue as a crisis, we appear capable of enacting and accepting extraordinary measures. Whether a country's public - and in particular its leaders - can accept that climate change is a crisis is, of course, another thing altogether.

Their small acreage is close to the beach and a haven for local wildlife. \"The birds, the surroundings and just a different lifestyle. I couldn't bring my kids up anywhere else,\" she said. But for the past few weeks, the realities of a life surrounded by nature have brought little but danger and displacement. </p><p>Bushfires have ripped through the area, turning the skies black with ash and leaving indelible marks not only on the landscape, but on the psyche of small rural communities. READ: From Australian bushfire ashes, a community rises in solidarity The intensity and scale of Australia's bushfire crisis this summer has been unprecedented. Already more than 10 million hectares of land - about 140 times the size of Singapore - have been left scorched, 27 people killed, a billion plus animals suspected dead and some 2,000 houses destroyed. But the worst is still yet to come, according to experts forecasting more extreme fire seasons as the effects of climate change become more apparent on the dry continent. READ: Hot and dry Australia could join the ranks of 'climate refugees' On New Year's Eve, Rochelle Ethell was meant to be ushering in 2020 with friends. The celebrations had already been muted by the looming threat and a deep orange sky that hung over Long Beach. They had been forced to evacuate their home earlier that month as the risks intensified. The community had emerged relatively unscathed on that day, and were able to return home. But what was coming at them now was a beast. Up and down the coast and into the hinterland, different fire fronts were tearing through sections of bush that had not burned for decades. The family was at risk and ordered to leave again. They did so, with Ethelle fleeing with her husband, two children, dog, cat, two birds and three chickens in tow. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWfFIxRyUDk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWfFIxRyUDk</url> \"It was a very stressful day not knowing if we were able to go home. It's not something I'd ever want to put my children through or experience again myself,\" she said. As they cowered, sweltering in the heat, soon the bad news came flowing in. Ethell was getting condolence messages she did not initially understand. Her business, a small tea salon in the historic town of Mogo, had been destroyed in the flames. \"There was nothing left. It was all gone.\" It took two days for her business neighbour and close friend Lexie Dunn to discover the same fate had befallen her shop, a fashion boutique. \"It's just devastating. I've lost my dream, a place that I used to come every day. I've been telling people, you know, I've loved this shop as much as I love my kids,\" she said. \"I just presumed it was going to be okay, and didn't think that this could happen to me. But it has.\" The fire's intensity and speed on that day and night shocked even one of Australia's most experienced fire officials - former New South Wales fire commissioner turned fighting volunteer, Greg Mullins. \"I've seen lots of fire over nearly 50 years of firefighting. I've never seen anything quite like this: The heat of the flames, the distance that new fires are starting ahead of the main fires because of sparks that were blown by very strong winds,\" he told CNA. \"As firefighters, we had to run for our lives on a number of occasions. There were streets we simply just couldn't go into because of the intensity of the fires. There were many, many homes that caught on fire and there was no way that we could put them out.\" READ: 'Too late to leave': Bushfires out of control across southeast Australia It is these type of fire events, unparalleled in Australia's history, that experts confidently predict will return in the near future. Last year was the country's driest and hottest in known history. It is not a record expected to stand for long. A FUTURE YOU REALLY WANT? The rise in temperature that Australia experienced in 2019 - more than two degrees above the 1960-1990 baseline - was \"extraordinary\", according to Professor Mark Howden, the director of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University and Vice Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And the science indicates that the only trajectory for heat in the country is up. \"We're likely to see that go up and up and up under the current emission commitments and actions that are taken globally. That will continue to drive things like extreme fires,\" Prof Howden said. READ: Authorities warn Australian bushfires developing their own weather systems He says there will be no time to get used to this hotter, drier environment. More intense, prolonged and damaging weather systems are on the way. \"In a constantly changing environment, there is no new normal. The new normal is continuous change. As soon as we start to think we're on top of climate change, new things will happen that we're not able to manage,\" he said. Historical climatologist Dr Linden Ashcroft researches past weather patterns and events to help better understand our climate future. And it is scary, she says. \"It was the hottest and driest and not by a little bit. We truly knocked it out of the park,\" she said. \"Scientifically, we know that these events are going to happen more often. But how common, how frequent and how devastating they are comes down to how much more we let the world heat up. \"It's not to say there won't be a future, but is that a future you really want? Where you have to wear a mask every day in the summer to walk your dog because every mountain is on fire. If you're afraid to go out into nature because a fire could start any time, then that's a weird world to be in. I think we can do better than that.\" READ: UN warns more extreme weather ahead after hottest decade on record READ: Extreme weather events in 2019 - Killer typhoons, Venice floods and the Sydney smoke crisis The Australian government has been reticent to draw direct comparisons between these bushfires and climate change. In fact, scepticism of the global crisis among influential members of the ruling party has stymied even modest changes to Australia's economy, energy use or major industry. The country overwhelmingly relies on mineral extraction, including coal, and exports as a source of national prosperity, as a result making it one of the worst polluters, per capita, in the world. Even throughout this disaster season, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has proven reluctant to answer probing questions about the impacts of climate change and worsening future fire seasons. He has suffered in public opinion polls in recent weeks. \"You cannot link any individual, single emissions reduction policy of any country, whether it's Australia or anyone else, to any specific fire event,\" Morrison told the ABC during an interview on Jan 10. \"I mean, that's just absurd.\" 'THE TIPPING POINT IS VERY NEAR' The government has committed to reducing its national emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris Agreement, a lowly objective compared to many other developed nations. But it is unclear whether the very limited climate policies currently in place will get the country close to achieving that target. \"The policies currently are flatlining our greenhouse emissions. They're not heading them downwards,\" Prof Howden said. \"There are ways of moving ahead on this issue but it does require a change of mindset and it does require leadership.\" The Australian Greens, a minor but vocal party on the national and state level, has been escalating its calls for \"a wholesale shake up of our political, economic, and social systems\". \"Australia has sadly become an embarrassment on the world stage. Not only are we not taking enough action on climate change but we have been trying to wreck climate change action globally as well,\" said NSW Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi. Commentary: Climate change needs better storytelling to address severe threats Other experts have highlighted the potential for Australia to refashion mining-dependent towns into renewable energy hubs and invest in new innovative technology. The potential political cost of such dramatic or expensive actions have long proven a barrier. Yet despite a polarised national debate, powered by government rhetoric and prominent media outlets, a 2019 survey by independent think tank Lowy Institute showed Australians overwhelmingly accepted the challenges and risks that lay ahead. With shocking images of bushfires destroying the environment around the country and toxic smoke hanging for weeks in major cities - and even spreading around the globe - there is a growing sense that change and action is required. \"It's really captured the world's imagination about what a scary apocalypse looks like. It's so visual. It's so graphically terrifying,\" Dr Ashcroft said. \"The community obviously has been going through a rollercoaster of emotions: distress, sadness, anxiety and anger. A lot of anger,\" Faruqi added. \"The community is definitely demanding strong actions and I do feel that the tipping point is very near, if it is not here already. We need to make sure that business as usual is no longer what we do,\" she said. Greg Mullins says he and other former fire chiefs tried to warn Prime Minister Morrison months ago about the fire threat this year and for the years to come. After being \"fobbed off\", now he sees victims angrily demanding more from their leaders. \"People in Australia want to know why these were the worst fires ever experienced and why we can't seem to do much about it. And that's because it has been supercharged by climate change. Therefore, action must be taken.\" Business owner Lexie Dunn is one of those suffering, her beloved Mogo store a pile of burned rubble and facing tens of thousands of dollars of losses. She is questioning strategies from authorities to keep people safe. \"This is too big now to be just sweeping the ash under the mat and forgetting about it. They can't afford to screw up again,\" she said.

But for some Australians involved in the coal-mining industry, the fires seemed to mainly be a natural catastrophe: Australia has had bushfires, even serious ones, since time immemorial and so there is no reason to put the blame on the exploitation of fossil fuels. So, is anthropogenic climate change real? Or is it be a matter of personal opinion? BIG HISTORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE Let us start with a simpler question: has the climate really changed?</p><p> The weather varies from day to day and season to season. These changes tend to reverse so that the environment never strays far from a stable, mean condition. This stable condition is what we refer to conceptually as the climate. Climate refers to both the physical and chemical state of the environment. It characterises not just the air but also the land, sea and ice on the planet. Therefore, a change in climate is a fundamental shift in the environment, unlike changes in weather, which is shorter term. Since the late 19th century, instruments documenting the average temperature of the Earth's surface show that the temperature has gone up by about 1 degree Celsius. Over the same period, the global mean sea level has climbed by nearly one-quarter metre at an increasing pace. This is because oceans expand thermally and because ice-caps and glaciers melt and flow into the sea. The chemical composition of the air is also a telling marker for our changing climate: carbon dioxide concentration has risen from around 290 ppmv (parts per million by volume) in 1880 to 400 ppmv in 2020. Today's elevated level of carbon dioxide is alarming because ancient air bubbles trapped in Antarctica's ice reveal that the level never exceeded 300 ppmv for the past 800,000 years. The big history of climate change has arrived. READ: Commentary - The wonder of clear skies and returning wildlife is our new climate problem HOW DOES CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT US? When the climate warms, extreme hot, dry weather becomes more severe and last longer, thus increasing the occurrence of forest fires that destroy life and property. This is what happened in Australia's case. Smoke from widespread fires creates haze which irritates the eyes and exacerbates respiratory illnesses. A regional haze episode can last for weeks to months. Meanwhile, unreliable water supply from rain catchment compels cities to rely more on costly desalination and water reclamation technologies. Just recall the dry spell in Singapore from July to September last year. As the sea level rises, agriculture in low-lying river deltas takes a hit: the Mekong delta has suffered from seawater seeping into precious paddy fields. As food prices tend to rise whenever food production falls, a populous, rice-importing nation like Indonesia is vulnerable to rice production cut-backs in Vietnam. There are many other examples that illustrate how climate change impacts negatively our lives and the economy. But the consequences go beyond human society as ecosystems are sensitive to environmental changes too. Warmer seas have bleached coral from the Great Barrier Reef in Southwest Pacific to the Maldives in Indian Ocean, for instance. UNDERSTANDING THE ROOT CAUSE Nowadays, many climate change sceptics no longer deny the reality of climate change. However, they argue that climate change is due to natural causes like an increase in the Sun's radiation. So how do we know that the scientists are right when they say that climate change is mainly caused by emissions of greenhouse gases? \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b The science of how greenhouse gases lead to global warming is no mystery: a greenhouse gas (GHG) is an atmospheric constituent that is effective in absorbing and emitting infrared radiation - a kind of light that has a longer wavelength than is visible to our eyes. Water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane are the three most abundant naturally occurring GHGs. The Earth's surface emits mainly infrared light upwards which is mostly absorbed by GHGs. Then GHGs re-emit the infrared light, some eventually escaping upward into space while the rest goes back downward. The Earth's surface re-absorbs the downward infrared light converting some of it into heat. This radiative transfer naturally keeps the Earth warm enough for life to exist. But from the time of the industrialisation, humankind has burnt much coal, oil and natural gas for energy, producing excessive carbon dioxide that has accumulated to the unprecedented levels today. Fossil-fuel mining, cattle farming and rice cultivation have also released much methane into the environment. The increased concentration of GHGs leads to greater absorption and re-emission of infrared light, causing the Earth's surface to be excessively warm and hence the sea level to rise. READ: Greener and cleaner - Reimagining our cities in the wake of COVID-19 REFUTING THE CLIMATE SCEPTICS There is an important fact which refutes the sceptics' argument that the Sun's radiation has simply increased. It is a little known fact that the temperature of the atmosphere does not change uniformly. Observations made by satellites from space show that around 15 to 25 km above the Earth's surface, in a layer of the atmosphere called the \"lower stratosphere\", there has been a long-term cooling trend since the late 1970s. The existence of global cooling refutes the climate sceptics' simple explanation that today's climate change is due to the Sun warming the Earth more. At the same time, this reinforces our understanding of the GHGs' effect. When GHGs absorb infrared light, they re-emit the radiation both downwards and upwards. As the downward infrared light warms up the Earth's surface, the upward infrared light simultaneously carries energy away into space. It is the increase in escaping energy from higher GHG concentration that cools the lower stratosphere. The distinctive pattern of warming-below-and-cooling-above is the fingerprint that identifies the culpability of GHGs. FAST-FORWARD TO THE FUTURE The climate has been changing for more than 100 years because of man-made GHG emissions. Projecting into the future, if we continue our business as usual, carbon dioxide levels are expected to exceed 900 ppmv before the year 2100. Scientists estimate that global average surface temperature will warm by about 3 to 5 degrees Celsius and global mean sea level will rise by about half to one metre over the 21st century. Changes in rainfall patterns are harder to predict but in Southeast Asia, droughts will likely worsen. Today, Singapore's daily temperature varies on average between 25 and 31 degrees Celsius. This spans 6 degrees Celsius. If we fast-forward to the decade 2091 - 2100, Singapore may be confronted with the possibility that its normal night-time temperature would be as high as today's normal day-time temperature! By 2100, about half the land in the Mekong delta of Vietnam could be lost to seawater intrusion. The risks posed to water and food resources will be grave if we continue to emit GHGs while ignoring climate change.

There are four sets of actions that individuals can resolve to: One, to conserve energy because most fossil fuel today is burnt to provide energy. For example, enjoying fewer hot showers and raising temperature settings in air-conditioners, or using more public transport and taking the stairs instead of the lift, all contribute to mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide. Two, to save water and reduce food wastage. The purification or reclamation of freshwater and the production, processing and transport of food expends energy, indirectly emitting carbon dioxide. Moreover, when food supply matches closely food demand, less methane is released unnecessarily in food production.

The country's Ninoy Aquino International Airport was closed for half a day as a precaution, affecting hundreds of flights, while the SEA Games 2019 saw some programming postponed.
