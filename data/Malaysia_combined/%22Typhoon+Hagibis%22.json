Olympic organisers have rescheduled rowing and archery over concerns about high winds from Tropical Storm Nepartak, which is packing gusts of up to 108 kmh. The storm, currently around 190km east of Choshi city, was originally headed for Tokyo, but has shifted north and is now expected to make landfall around the Miyagi region early on Wednesday. </p><p>Miyagi and neighbouring Ibaraki are hosting several Olympic events - some of the few that fans are allowed to attend, but organisers said they would not be affected by the storm. \"Games in Miyagi and Ibaraki will be held as scheduled. We expect spectators to come watch too,\" Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya told reporters. On Tuesday, the approaching storm was already bringing wind and rain to parts of Japan's east coast, making for challenging conditions at the women's triathlon in Tokyo. The event started 15 minutes late because of the weather and the wet roads slipped up several athletes during the cycling section. But conditions were better at the surfing competition, taking place east of Tokyo in Chiba. Organisers decided to squeeze the quarter-finals, semi-finals and medal events of the men's and women's competitions into Tuesday to take advantage of the waves. Japanese government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Tuesday that the storm was moving very slowly and already producing strong winds and rough seas along much of the northeast coast. He warned of \"heavy rain through tomorrow\" in the areas around Tokyo, as well as the Tohoku region to the northeast and the Hokuriku region to the northwest, where the storm will head after making landfall. Kato urged local residents to \"pay attention to the latest information about the weather and evacuation orders\". Some train services in the area where the storm will hit have been cancelled, and non-mandatory evacuation orders have been issued around the town of Atami, where heavy rain earlier this month caused a landslide that killed 21 people. Japan's typhoon season runs from around May to October, peaking in August and September.

Elsewhere in the gym, cardboard partitions separate the 233 evacuees' sleeping areas and another sign instructs them to check their temperature each morning, then sterilise the thermometers. The measures show what a thorny issue it is for Japan to deal with natural disasters in the time of coronavirus. READ: Japan issues fresh rain disaster warnings as toll hits 54 Japanese authorities have been warning local officials for months to include coronavirus measures in their disaster preparations. </p><p>Residents have been urged to seek shelter with friends or relatives if possible to avoid overcrowding evacuation centres. But coronavirus contagion was the last thing on the mind of 78-year-old retiree Aiko Ishimura when neighbours knocked on her door on Monday to tell her about evacuation orders. Ishimura, who lives alone, had planned to shelter at home. \"So we just came as we were. We were in such a rush to come here, we didn't bring anything,\" Ishimura, who fled with neighbours, told Reuters. \"I wasn't worried at all about coronavirus, not at all.\" \"We don't have many cases here in the first place. We don't really do the whole mask-wearing thing,\" she added, although she said she keeps a mask in her pocket.

That compares with close to 7,000 in Tokyo, where cases are on the rise again among its 14 million residents. Misa Matsuda, a 48-year-old nurse, accustomed to the annual floods in the region, had also intended to remain at home. But she was stunned early Monday when she opened her door and found the river flowing just a few feet from her house. \"I thought, there's no way the water would come up here to our house, where it's a bit of a hill,\" she said. Extreme weather disasters have become increasingly common in Japan recently. Last year, Typhoon Hagibis killed nearly 100 people, a year after more than 200 died in western Japan in the worst flooding in decades. Matsuda said she wasn't too concerned about coronavirus because basic steps were being taken, but did worry residents would congregate to chat, creating just the sort of crowded conditions authorities say increase infection risk. City official Takanobu Ono said the evacuation centre was limited to 300 people despite a capacity for 500. But he said the priority for evacuees was escaping with their lives. \"Some of have just been saved by the skin of their teeth,\" he said. \"The reality is that coronavirus is less of a concern for them ...

Born in New Zealand but a resident of Japan since he was 15, Leitch captained a multicultural squad that represented a nation often perceived, by the Japanese as much as anyone, as monocultural. Three straight wins over Russia, Ireland and Samoa set the World Cup alight and triggered a mania that engulfed Japan for a few glorious weeks. Central to their success, Leitch says, was the 'One Team' ethos, bringing together players born in seven different countries to present an entirely new face of Japanese sport. </p><p>\"One thing we did well as a team was base our team in Japan and brought different ways of thinking and cultures ... into the team,\" Leitch told Reuters in an interview last month. \"This made it the team we had. \"There are a lot of things that Japanese society can take out from what we accomplished at the World Cup.\" Monday marks six months to the day since Japan's final pool fixture against Scotland, a match almost blown away by a super typhoon that caused the unprecedented cancellation of three other World Cup matches. Typhoon Hagibis threatened to wreak havoc with the tournament as it bore down on the Tokyo region. The Scots, who would have been eliminated had the match been cancelled, trained in the confines of their hotel while their union boss issued threats of legal action. Japan, by contrast, trained outside during the quieter moments of the typhoon and were raring to go when the match was given the green light a few hours before kickoff. \"We addressed it, said we weren't going to change anything, it is going to be raining but we are going to be training,\" Leitch recalled. \"We were fully focused on us beating Scotland. If we flip the coin and look at Scotland, they were very, very nervous. Which they should have been. \"For us to focus on ourselves and go out there and bounce Scotland was a very good feeling.\" It is hard to imagine much more going right for Japan on an emotional and unforgettable night at Yokohama Stadium. Scotland scored an early try but Japan soon hit their stride, replying with four of their own en route to a 28-21 win and a place in the last eight of a World Cup for the first time. At the final whistle, the home fans erupted in a frenzy that would have stirred the most stoic of neutrals. Leitch's first words were, typically, for those suffering from the typhoon. MASSIVE PRESSURE While the victory over Scotland looked nerveless, there had been some jitters in coach Jamie Joseph's squad a few weeks earlier when four years of hard work were put on the line in the tournament opener against Russia. \"The pressure was massive, we expected it and I thought we dealt with it very well,\" reflected Leitch. \"There was a period of 15 minutes where we were a bit flustered, but collectively I think we re-grouped.\" Japan eventually overcame their opening-night nerves, recovering from conceding the first try of the tournament to beat Russia comfortably. Next up were Ireland, who had run up 50 points against the Japanese at the same Shizuoka Stadium two years previously and were ranked number one in the world coming into the tournament. Although seen as a free hit for Japan, they were still expected to pick their strongest team for their toughest pool match and there was shock when Leitch was dropped to the bench. \"That was a very interesting week,\" Leitch said with a smile. \"It definitely wasn't a surprise. If the team was to win then the best team needed to play and the way I was playing that wasn't me. \"I had to take it on the chin and prepare the team like I usually do ... One thing I appreciate about Jamie too is that is he not going to beat around the bush and say it nicely. He will say it straight. That is what makes him such a good coach. \"But I had an opportunity to gain his trust again in that second test.\" Leitch did just that, coming on after 30 minutes with Japan trailing 12-3 and inspiring a comeback that left the Irish clinging on to a losing bonus point at the end. \"We knew, as a team, if we got everything right and played to our gameplan, everyone did their individual roles, then we would come away with what we wanted,\" said Leitch. That victory over Ireland would have gone down as the biggest upset at a World Cup had Japan not beaten South Africa at the 2015 tournament. Four years later the Springboks had their revenge, however, defeating the tired Japanese 26-3 in the last of the 2019 quarter-finals before going on to win the tournament. \"If we had played any other team we would have had a different outcome I think,\" said Leitch. \"I wouldn't have done anything differently.

No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics, and every country has important gaps to address.\" Just a couple of months later, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China - and quickly demonstrated the accuracy of the report's assessment. The virus, now called COVID-19, was first discovered in China's Wuhan municipality, but was not taken sufficiently seriously by the authorities in the early weeks. Multiple mistakes being made, including the failure to comprehend the virus's speed of transmission, compounded by the delay in informing the public about the outbreak. </p><p>In fact, some who first warned of the disease - most notably the ophthalmologist Li Wenliang - were reprimanded by local authorities. (Li subsequently died of the disease.) It was not until Jan 20 that the government acted, after another doctor, Zhong Nanshan - a hero in China's fight against the 2003 outbreak of another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - alerted the public of the seriousness of the new virus. Explore our interactive: All the COVID-19 cases in Singapore and the clusters and links between them Wuhan and neighbouring cities in Hubei province - with a total population of some 58.5 million people - are now in complete lockdown. Across China, as many as 700 million people are largely confined to their homes. AN UNPRECEDENTED RESPONSE China's government subsequently mobilised more than 200 medical teams from around the country, including from the military, to help contain the disease. It also built three new hospitals, and nine temporary hospitals, with unprecedented speed. And it gave provincial, municipal, and county-level governments strict instructions on improving public hygiene, isolating possible victims, and sharing experience and expertise. China's unprecedented response appeared to have slowed the spread of the disease domestically. But densely populated Wuhan is a transportation hub, home to central China's biggest airport, from which roughly 30,000 people, on average, depart daily. This means COVID-19 can and has spread around the world rapidly, testing the public health response capacity of countries far and wide. MORE COUNTRIES NOW FACE THE SAME TEST As of Feb 25, the World Health Organization reported over 80,000 cases in at least 33 countries, and 2,700 deaths (a 3.4 per cent mortality rate). Hubei province accounted for the most cases, and 95 per cent of fatalities so far. South Korea is now second to China for COVID-19 infections, with over 1,200 confirmed cases. The government has placed the country on the highest possible alert - a move that allows for lockdowns and other containment measures. The southeastern city of Daegu, where cases are concentrated, has essentially been under a state of emergency. Japan, with over 800 cases (if you count around 700 from a single cruise ship) is third on the list. READ: Commentary: Three scenarios if the COVID-19 outbreak gets worse READ: Commentary: Japan shows how not to deal with a COVID-19 outbreak The virus is also gaining ground in Europe, with 325 cases confirmed in Italy. The country has now quarantined more than 50,000 people. Even Iran is facing an uptick in infections. Hopes that a pandemic can be averted are dwindling fast. A SERIOUS ECONOMIC TOLL All of this is taking a serious economic toll, as global supply chains are disrupted and services halted. Moreover, Japan's economy - already under pressure from another consumption-tax hike and the fallout from Typhoon Hagibis - seems likely to contract even further. In South Korea, a key hub in global supply chains, Samsung Electronics has suspended smartphone plant operations in Gumi after an employee tested positive for COVID-19. After Apple warned that its quarterly revenues will take a hit, owing to slowed iPhone production and the closure of Apple stores in China, global investors are getting nervous. In the United States, the S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 3 per cent at the start of trading on Feb 24. With the outbreak still escalating, the global damage will run deeper than supply-chain disruptions. The sudden reduction in production and services is driving a shift in consumption patterns and business operations in China toward e-commerce and tele-commuting - a trend that may be mirrored in other affected countries as the virus spreads. A HUGE BELIEF IN CHINA SHAKEN The economic effects of this shift - including changes in Chinese demand for travel, tourism services, and luxury goods - will reverberate globally for months to come. But the more profound effect of the COVID-19 lockdown is on Chinese social dynamics. READ: Commentary: In Hong Kong, the COVID-19 outbreak sent shockwaves but could reinvigorate protests READ: Commentary: Hit hard by COVID-19, Singapore Airlines may need to pursue deeper capacity cuts An unprecedented number of Chinese, up to half of the population, have been trapped indoors for more than a month, with time to reflect on the disease's consequences for life, family, and society. However difficult the lockdown has been, they have been able to count on their government to deliver power, water, and online services reliably. Of course, the government has also faced plenty of criticism on social media for its early attempts to suppress critical information. But it has since allowed more open debate and feedback, as in-depth reports by Caixin magazine have shown. The COVID-19 crisis has shaken the belief that economic prosperity can compensate for social well-being. Death in one-child households terminates the whole generational lineage, something unprecedented in Chinese family history. As a result, the Chinese may reorient themselves toward health, home, and family, after years of rising travel and offline consumption. The global media frenzy, some tinged with coronavirus-fuelled xenophobia, could reinforce China's self-reflection and self-strengthening impulses, particularly in sorting out domestic public health, social security, and governance issues. Already, COVID-19 has led to swift domestic damage control and a massive re-orientation of priorities, such as innovative ways of dealing with business cash flows, survival of SMEs, job disruptions, and restoring key supply chains. A FOCUS ON RESILIENCE NEEDED But even when the virus is contained, escalating geopolitical rivalries, technological disruption, climate change, and the likelihood of new pandemics loom. So, beyond tackling the current crisis, China's government should be working on long-term resilience-building reforms in education, health care, the social safety net, and internal feedback mechanisms. The public expects no less. The same is true worldwide. At a time of unprecedented global interconnectedness, our biggest challenges are shared. Every country must work to build its resilience, or no one will be safe.

A SERIOUS ECONOMIC TOLL All of this is taking a serious economic toll, as global supply chains are disrupted and services halted. Moreover, Japan's economy - already under pressure from another consumption-tax hike and the fallout from Typhoon Hagibis - seems likely to contract even further. In South Korea, a key hub in global supply chains, Samsung Electronics has suspended smartphone plant operations in Gumi after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.

This was done through his brand of economics, known as Abenomics, aimed at addressing Japan's low inflation problem, decreasing worker productivity and the challenges raised by an ageing population. Abe has also been credited for restoring relations with China after a bilateral maritime dispute soured relations from 2012 to 2013. That is why there was a wave of concern in the international media recently when PM Abe was admitted to the Keio Hospital for check-ups on Aug 24 and Aug 17, drawing attention to his health. Due to the open transparency requirements of political office holders in Japan, his previously disclosed ailment of chronic colitis is not a new issue. It was the main cause of his resignation during his first term in office from 2006 to 2007. The ailment was managed well in his second term with the use of a new drug. Nevertheless, the visits were sufficient to trigger media speculation over leadership succession within the party. </p><p>CONCERNING TIME FOR LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION If any potential leadership change takes place hypothetically, there are two narratives about its timing. For one, critics of the administration consider these medical check-ups to be an honourable way for the Prime Minister to leave office based on legitimate health reasons. This year alone, Abe has come under criticism from the opposition parties for his plan to raise the retirement age of prosecutors. Critics charged that his government has reacted too slowly to COVID-19. A poll by Nikkei TV in May showed that 55 per cent of the respondents did not agree with Abe's handling of the crisis though the NHK poll released on Aug 12 showed that 58 per cent of those who support the Cabinet said it is better than other ministerial line-ups. READ: Commentary: How many times must Japan be urged to step up COVID-19 testing? However, many Abe allies and their Japanese supporters do not see the need to change leadership in the middle of an economic crisis and a pandemic. They have argued political continuity will be key in this battle. As of Aug 27, Japan has recorded 63,822 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 1,209 deaths. At 45th highest number of cases overall in the world, these are relatively low numbers in advanced economies. It has suffered its worst economic growth in the post-war period, as its second quarter GDP dropped at an annualised rate of 27.8 per cent though its 7.8 per cent drop from the previous quarter makes it the best performing economy among G7 economies. Despite criticisms, there is also a tacit acknowledgement that Abe is probably Japan's best bet to engineer a credible response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has after all provided a strong economic policy response to the post-bubble economy since coming into office. READ: Commentary: Japan sure is smug about beating COVID-19 There is also concern and recognition that many of his potential successors may not have the necessary factional support of leading the country out of economic difficulties yet. THE CONTENDERS FOR THE POST Contenders being highlighted by the media include younger members of Abe's cabinet: Toshimitsu Motegi, who is a trusted Abe confidante, negotiator for the US-Japan free trade agreement and now the country's Foreign Minister; Health Minister Katsunobu Kato, Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, Defence Minister Taro Kono who is also a Washington insider, former Foreign Minister and the son of veteran China-hand and former Speaker of the House Yohei Kono. In terms of dark horse candidates, another name floated in the media is that of former economy, trade and industry minister Yuko Obuchi - the daughter of former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi who was replaced in 2000 due to a stroke while Yuko stepped down due to a scandal. She stands out as the only female candidate in this race mentioned in the media though current Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike's name was momentarily also mentioned. READ: Commentary: Yuriko Koike, the woman who may be Japan's first female prime minister Besides these younger politicians, two veterans have also been touted as potential candidates: Yoshihide Suga, a trusted Abe ally and Chief Cabinet Secretary, and former LDP Secretary General Shigeru Ishiba who was formerly also Abe's main rival and contender for prime ministership. Since 2019, Japan's media has scrutinised these candidates. At various points, different candidates have enjoyed more attention since speculation that Abe may call for a snap election to renew his mandate was afoot, even though his current term lasts until September 2021. JAPAN'S BEST BETS FOR SUCCESSION That speculation continued this week as news of Abe's illness broke. This time, it was Foreign Minister Motegi's turn to enjoy the media spotlight. Presently, Motegi is also the favourite to succeed Abe. Motegi's success in building factional support, especially from the powerful Taro Aso - the current Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Finance Minister - faction could prove useful in the current pandemic and economic scenarios. This is an essential step for any would-be PM aspirant as the consensus seeking nature of the Japanese political system requires its leader to be a skilful aggregator of the different interests of all stakeholders, rather than behave like an authoritarian leader. His dine-in meeting with Aso on Jul 31 was highly publicised and has positioned him as a strong and driven leader who can mobilise factional support to manage the multiple crises facing Japan. Motegi's biggest obstacle is perceived to be the faction of Wataru Takeshita, the former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) General Council Chairperson, which previously split along the lines of support for Abe in the 2018 LDP Presidential election. In the last two years, Fumio Kishida, former Foreign Minister and now chairman of the LDP's Policy Research Council, enjoyed media attention as a candidate for political succession. But, due to the pandemic, Kishida's clout has weakened in 2020 as his COVID-19 relief plan was dropped in favour of an alternative plan advocated by LDP's coalition partner, the Komeito Party. READ: Commentary: The road to a COVID-19 vaccine is long and narrowing He also carries the image of a dovish peacetime leader rather than a strong crisis leader who has to handle severe ongoing China-US tensions, challenging bilateral relations with South Korea, as well as managing the devastating economic impact of COVID-19. In fact, before the emergence of Motegi as frontrunner, veteran Suga was floated as an alternative candidate since he enjoys factional support inside the party and has a positive working relationship with LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai. Another who has impressed in recent times is Koike. In addition to providing gender diversity, the Tokyo Governor has been heralded by the media for her skilful management of the COVID-19 mitigation measures in Tokyo. Her success in doing so may convince Japan's lawmakers that she could replicate that formula on the national level too. As for future leaders-in-waiting, 2019 witnessed the emergence of a young and rising political star - Koizumi. He is the second son of charismatic former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and the third youngest individual to assume a cabinet-level post in Japanese political history. Koizumi's ministerial portfolio is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has given him much-needed crisis management experience. As Environment Minister, he has to manage the fallout from the damaged Fukushima nuclear reactor, given domestic and international concerns over its leakage. Barely a month into his ministerial post in 2019, Koizumi was already put to the test in the public eye when Japan was hit by a series of typhoons, including Typhoon Hagibis, the deadliest typhoon to have directly hit Tokyo in half a century. Many consider Koizumi to be a Washington insider as he is well-acquainted with Washington DC's corridors of power as well as top Japan specialists and academics in the US. Koizumi graduated with a Masters in Political Science from Columbia University and interacted with top US-based Japan specialists while he also worked in the well-known US think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. His political pedigree as the fourth generation in his family to be in politics, US education and familiarity with Washington hands are advantageous to his future political ambitions, putting him in good stead for managing international relations in a future leadership role. His charismatic popularity with the Japanese public is another plus point. If he becomes prime minister, he can help win back support for the government, which according to opinion polls stands at 49 per cent. JAPAN'S POLITICAL FUTURE APPEARS BRIGHT While having a competent and experienced prime minister could be crucial, Japan's population can take heart knowing that, regardless, the leader of their country will have access to a highly-competent bureaucracy that not only enjoys wide public support and legitimacy but also provides sound and experienced policy advice. While it is yet unclear if Abe will or need to step down, at least the attention on his health issues has opened up a conversation on what Japan's political future after Abe may look like. Even if there is no change in the prime minister appointment, it seems a whole new generation of younger leaders have emerged to take over the baton in any post-Abe scenario. The state of Japanese leadership succession is energetically competitive with no lack of credible candidates. That may be a bright spot in an otherwise challenging period for the nation.

Average temperatures for the last five years were the highest on record for most of the planet. Land-based global temperature from January to October 2019 was approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, according to the World Meteorological Office. In Singapore, 2019 was our joint hottest year on record, on par with 2016 temperatures. The island state is heating up at about 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade - twice as fast as the rest of the world, according to the Meteorological ServiceSingapore (MSS). READ: Commentary: That low-carbon future for Singapore isn't so far-fetched Worse, our planet's oceans, which act as a buffer by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide, continue to heat up far more quickly than previously thought. </p><p>Recent research has estimated the oceans are heating up 40 per cent faster on average than estimated five years ago. At our coast, the rate of sea level rise continues to accelerate primarily due to the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, driven by rising greenhouse gas concentrations. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit a record 411.85 parts per million (ppm) in December 2019. Carbon dioxide we emit into the atmosphere stays there for centuries, and carbon dioxide taken into the ocean stays for even longer, thus locking us into further climate change and global warming. HOTTER DAYS Our planet continues to heat up on average. Singapore's hottest day in 2019 was Apr 17, with 36.4 degrees C measured in Paya Lebar, according to the MSS. Our hottest days are likely to get even hotter. Hotter days are not only unpleasant for humans and many animals, but they will likely place greater strain on human health and our health system in Singapore. An increase in the number of days over 36 degrees will place tremendous stress on our vulnerable elderly and those that work outdoors. Singapore and much of Southeast Asia already experience relatively hot temperatures and high humidity year-round. High humidity means perspiration doesn't evaporate as quickly placing stress on your body as it is harder to stay cool. If the temperature continues to rise and humidity remains high then there will likely be an increase in the number of people who experience heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

Many other regions across Asia are likely to feel the pressures of extreme heat and its effects on ageing populations and the economically disadvantaged. ABNORMAL WEATHER EVENTS While the average climate change indicators continue rising, the day-to-day impact of climate change on our lives are felt through extreme or \"abnormal\" weather events. One of the main impact of climate change is erratic rainfall patterns. Such variability in rainfall threatens agriculture and crop yields, which combined with population increase, pose considerable food security challenges to vulnerable countries in the region. In mid-2019, Thailand saw a significant drop in rice production as reservoirs dried up. Australia, a net exporter of wheat, faced the unique case of needing to seek imports to supply its domestic demand. Other events in 2019 also demonstrated the importance of understanding extreme events such as floods and droughts, as much of Asia received abnormally high or low rainfall. In India, the onset and withdrawal of the Indian Monsoon was delayed, causing a dry spell and water stress in June. The dry spell was followed by extreme rainfall that generated a series of floods in late July and early August 2019. The floods killed at least 200 people and displaced more than a million. People were going from having no water in a drought to too much water in floods in the space of a few weeks. Exceptionally dry conditions prevailed in Asia Pacific over 2019, especially Indonesia and the Mekong basin in the second half, which led to the most significant fire season since 2015, with haze spreading across the region, including Singapore. READ: Commentary: Air pollution's nasty effects should motivate stronger action but hasn't Commentary: Typhoon Mangkhut destroys rice, corn and fish - but what has this got to do with Singapore? Drought conditions in Australia also highlighted this peril to the world. Much of inland eastern Australia had been experiencing drought through 2017 and 2018, and in 2019, the drought expanded and intensified. Australia just experienced its worst fire season in recent memory, but as some fires ended, the rains came. Much of fire-ravaged eastern Australia is now experiencing dramatic flood events. There should be no doubt the Australian fires are linked to climate change. A warmer, dryer atmosphere coupled with prolonged drought were a catastrophe waiting to happen. The Australian government was warned repeatedly and accurately. The Garnaut Climate Change Review of 2008 said projections of fire weather \"suggest that fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later, and generally be more intense\", further stating that \"this effect increases over time, but should be directly observable by 2020.\" Other climate extremes that made the news several times in 2019 were tropical cyclones or typhoons, with Typhoon Hagibis barely missing Tokyo in October, but still causing severe flooding and significant economic losses. Toward year-end, the people of the central Philippines experienced yet another damaging typhoon, as Typhoon Phanfone battered the Philippines on Christmas Day, bringing a wet, miserable and terrifying holiday to millions. With continued warming of our oceans, the future of cyclones and storms remains a topic of considerable debate. Here too, there is much more to do to answer questions about the future of cyclones in our region. READ: Commentary: I care about climate change. I don't wish to live in a Waterworld like Kevin Costner THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE RESEARCH Climate researchers are always examining the likelihood of changes in how often extreme weather and climate events will occur and whether or not they will become larger and more damaging. Unfortunately, our understanding of the dynamic processes in the tropics remains rather poor. We have very little data on the comparative frequency and intensity of past events. However, the extreme climate events of 2019 have generated a groundswell of activity calling for a new wave of climate impact research. In July 2019, for instance, Malaysia's Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources commissioned a national audit on the water industry in anticipation of the longer droughts expected due to climate change. Such research would inform and facilitate efforts by industries and governments to improve the way they interpret and manage risks around extreme climate events. What we do know is that extreme events are commonly the result of a combination of driving factors. Multiple hazardous events cascade when they act as a series. For example, droughts can lead to increased risk of wildfires, which then heighten the risk of landslides. This rising risk posed by extreme events is very real in the tropics and Asia's emerging cities. We urgently need to dig deeper for detailed investigations of likely changes in storm systems, dry periods, extreme rainfall or heat in the context of a rapidly changing climate.

CORE ISSUES FOR SINGAPORE'S FUTURE Climate change and climatic extremes are a core issue for Singapore's future. Not only do hotter days strain public health, but prolonged droughts or dry spells will almost certainly stress our water supply. This will force Singapore to consider further investment in relatively expensive water recycling and desalinisation engineering. Moreover, flooding events are all likely to affect the everyday lives of many Singaporeans by disrupting transport and business. READ: Commentary: As time runs out on the climate crisis, Singapore prepares to address the cost of adapting Against the backdrop of rising sea levels, Singapore faces an increased risk of compound flooding as flood waters reach our coast. In his Budget 2020 speech, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced a new Coastal and Flood Protection fund with an initial injection of S$5 billion. Being that climate change adaptation might cost S$100 billion or more over 100 years, Singapore is beginning to set aside resources for it. As we keep an eye on climate change, it's crucial that we understand how it can manifest as extreme weather, with adverse impact on Singapore and the region.

The government set up a task force to deal with the damage. \"I extend my condolences for all those who lost their lives and offer my sympathy to all those impacted by Typhoon No.19 (Hagibis),\" Abe said. \"With respect to blackouts, water outage and suspension of transportation services, we intend to exert all-out efforts for the earliest recovery ... we ask the public to remain vigilant of landslides and other hazards,\" he said. Some 27,000 members of Japan's self-defence forces as well as firefighters, police and coast guard members were sent to rescue stranded people in central Japan's Nagano prefecture and elsewhere, the government said. Some came in helicopters who winched people from the roofs and balconies of flooded homes. FLOODS, LANDSLIDES NHK said overflowing rivers could inflict more damage as waters had reached dangerously high levels. With thousands of homes without power, Japanese feared a repeat of the weeks-long power outages after last month's typhoon that hit east of Tokyo. In Fukushima, north of the capital, Tokyo Electric Power reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overnight. The plant was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Tepco spokeswoman Emi Iwasa said the typhoon triggered 11 leak alerts at the plant. Of those, eight were confirmed as being triggered by rainwater and the rest were still being investigated. Iwasa said the operator had so far not confirmed if any radioactive water leaked into sea. Landing restrictions at Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports were lifted but more than 800 flights were cancelled for the day, NHK said, as were some Shinkansen bullet train services to the worst-hit areas.

The storm claimed its first victim even before making landfall, when high winds flipped a vehicle, killing its driver. The first floor of a large aged care home in Nagano city was shown under water. Rescuers took residents from another flooded aged care facility by inflatable boats and carried them on their backs to safety. They also searched for survivors in homes destroyed in landslides near Tokyo's suburbs and in Fukushima prefecture, NHK showed. \"GREAT IMPACT\" Bodies were retrieved from homes and vehicles submerged by floodwaters, from raging overflowing rivers, and from buildings buried in landslides. NHK said overflowing rivers could inflict more damage as waters had reached dangerously high levels. \"We continue to see a great impact on people's life,\" Mr Abe said. \"The government will do its utmost,\" he added, pledging to deploy more troops and emergency officials if needed. Authorities at one point issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Close to 150 injuries have been reported so far, NHK said. The storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm of rain over 24 hours. \"The water came up higher than my head in the house,\" Hajime Tokuda, a finance professional living in Kawasaki near Tokyo told AFP. He moved to his family's home nearby, but that flooded too and they had to be rescued by boat. In Saitama's Higashi Matsuyama city, northwest of Tokyo, rice and flower farmers were counting their losses, with water submerging warehouses full of freshly harvested product. \"We never had a flood like this before in this neighbourhood,\" said one farmer, who declined to give his name. \"We cannot even go into the flower warehouse due to the water.

A dire game sparked into life in the 45th minute when simmering tensions briefly boiled over leaving the 1.72m Springbok leaning up into his 1.97m opponent who grabbed De Klerk's collar. The pair were quickly separated, but the image spawned dozens of memes, some set to romantic music. Canadian gents Canada left Japan without a win on the rugby field, but they won over an entire nation by helping to clean up flood-ravaged parts of Kamaishi following Typhoon Hagibis. The Canadians' last game against Namibia was cancelled due to the typhoon with landslides and flooding affecting the area near the stadium. Instead the Canadian team visited places hit by the typhoon and helped sweep streets and clean out elderly residents' flood-damaged homes. Kabuki roar The comically blood curdling Kabuki roar... imitated by many, mastered by few, the loud, prolonged shout was a firm favourite with fans inside stadiums. The scream, heard at every restart, was accompanied by a cartoon head peeping up from the bottom of the scoreboard.

Wing Kenki Fukuoka led the way with two tries, while Kotaro Matsushima and Keita Inagaki also scored as the hosts held off a fierce second-half assault from a team they had lost against in all seven of their previous meetings. When Japan beat South Africa four years ago - having won only one of their previous 24 World Cup matches - it was considered the greatest shock in rugby history. This time, having already beaten Ireland three weeks ago, it did not even feel like a real surprise. They were faster, sharper, more inventive and, roared on by the vast majority of the delirious red-clad 72,00 crowd, absolutely relentless in everything they did as they became the first tier-two team to reach the last eight since Fiji in 2007. Having won all four of their matches to top Pool A, they will face the Springboks again in the quarter-finals and the twice-champions will be taking absolutely nothing for granted. </p><p>The result also meant that Ireland, through as runners-up, will play New Zealand. \"Tonight we went another level,\" said Japan coach Jamie Joseph. \"They wanted it as much as the Scots and gave as much as they could.

Captain Michael Leitch said that the victory owed more to heart than skill and while that might be true of their mighty defensive effort in the final quarter, no team in the tournament so far has come close to matching the pace and directness of Japan's first-half assault.

Fukuoka tore down the left and as he was tackled to the floor, slung a one-armed pass into the arms of the supporting Matsushima to go over and detonate an explosion of noise. If that was good, their next score was a contender for try of the tournament. Fukuoka and Matsushima again put on the afterburners and then a mesmerizing series of off-loads and side-steps ended with Shota Horie presenting supporting prop Inagaki with an unmissable opportunity. Japan were playing with a speed and intensity that the Scots just could not live with and got a third try at the end of the half when Tim Lafaele slipped through a deft grubber that bounced perfectly into the arms of the Fukuoka. It was then bedlam two minutes into the second half when Fukuoka stripped Chris Harris and galloped clear for a fourth and bonus-point clinching try. The Scots, who came from 31-0 down to draw 38-38 with England in the Six Nations in March, dredged up that Twickenham spirit from somewhere as WP Nel and Zander Fagerson scored to get back within seven points with 25 minutes to go. It was relentless Scottish pressure and desperate, at times demented, Japanese defending from then on, but the hosts held out for another famous victory in what became a deafening cauldron of noise. It was only the second time Scotland have failed to reach the last eight - the other coming in 2011 - but they can have few complaints, bookending wins over Russia and Samoa with defeats by Ireland and the hosts. \"We had a mountain to climb after that first half but we started climbing it and I thought the effort the players put in to get back to within seven points was excellent,\" said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend. \"We were obviously aware that this was huge for the home nation.

Scotland (currently 10 points) would be eliminated. Ireland (11 points) can guarantee progress with a bonus-point victory over Samoa (5). An Irish win without a bonus point could open the way for a three-way tie at the top on 15 points if Sunday's game goes ahead. In that scenario, the deadlock would be initially settled by total points difference, which currently stands at Scotland (+71), Ireland (+52) and Japan (+46). If Scotland still have the higher difference after the last two matches, they would top the group. For second place and the other ticket to the quarter-finals, the process reverts to head-to-head results and would send Japan through thanks to their win over Ireland. Should Ireland end with the best overall points difference, they would top the group and Scotland would go through in second place after what would be their win over Japan. If Scotland beat Japan with no bonus points for either side, they would pip the hosts on the head-to-head result and progress. Depending on the Ireland result, Scotland could also advance with a bonus point win - assuming Japan do not collect two bonus points in defeat. If Japan gain a losing bonus point and Scotland fail to claim a bonus point, Japan would finish above the Scots and advance to the knockout stage in first or second place. Victory or a draw for Japan would seal top spot, but they would also go through as pool winners if they lose to Scotland by seven points or less but score four tries, delivering a rare two bonus points. Four years ago Japan won three games but finished third in their pool because of bonus points, pipped to qualification by Scotland and South Africa - the only time a team has won three pool matches and not progressed. Likely outcome: Ireland to qualify with bonus-point victory over Samoa. Too close to call on who joins them. POOL B After the cancellation of New Zealand's game against Italy, the top three places are settled. New Zealand (16) top the group, with South Africa (15) runners-up. Italy (12) finish third. New Zealand will play the Pool A runners-up, with South Africa playing the Group A winners. POOL C Things are also settled here after England v France was cancelled. England (17) and France (15) are through to the last eight. Group winners England will play the runners-up from Pool D, probably Australia, with France likely to play Wales. POOL D Australia (16) and Wales (14) are guaranteed a place in the last eight but the pool's final match - Wales v Uruguay (4) on Sunday - could also still fall foul of the weather. If it is cancelled, Wales would collect two points to finish level with Australia but would get top spot due to beating them earlier in the tournament. If the game goes ahead, any sort of win for Wales would also put them top, although they would still top the group in the unlikely scenario of them picking up two losing bonus points. Fiji (7) finished third to secure automatic qualification for the 2023 World Cup. Likely outcome: Wales to win last game against Uruguay, top the group and play France in last eight.

Both games were in the projected path of the large and powerful typhoon, which currently has a \"violent\" rating - the highest category by Japan's weather bureau - and is due to hit the Tokyo area on Saturday. Sunday's four games, including the key Pool A shoot-out between hosts Japan and Scotland in Yokohama, near Tokyo, remain under review, said tournament director Alan Gilpin. \"We've taken the very difficult decision to cancel certain matches in the affected areas,\" Gilpin said. </p><p>\"While it's regrettable, we've made, we believe, the right decision with everyone's safety as the priority,\" he added. READ: England boss thanks 'typhoon gods' after World Cup game axed Tens of thousands of fans, many of them visitors from abroad, will be affected by the cancellations - the first in the tournament's 32-year history. Their tickets will be fully refunded, Gilpin said. Japan, whose capital Tokyo hosts the Olympics next year, is battered by around 20 typhoons per year and is one of the world's most seismically active countries. But Gilpin stressed he had \"no regrets at all\" about bringing the World Cup to Japan, the first Asian country to host the tournament. \"I think what you've all seen over the last three weeks absolutely in every respect vindicates the right decisions to be hosting a World Cup here in Japan,\" he said. \"We always knew there were going to be risks. It's rare for a typhoon of this magnitude to cause this impact this late in the typhoon season.\" He added that World Rugby had looked \"pretty exhaustively\" at other options for the games, including switching venues, but \"we couldn't guarantee consistent contingency plans across all those games safely for all the teams and fans involved\". Seven games were slated for the final weekend of the pool stage, when matches are tightly packed and cannot be rescheduled. Cancelled games are recorded as 0-0 draws, with both teams awarded two points. IMPACT ON FINAL PLACINGS England and France have already booked a spot in the quarter-finals but the decision to cancel Italy's match eliminates them from contention. A win over the All Blacks in Toyota could have taken the Italians through. New Zealand now top the group, ahead of South Africa. With hosts Japan and Scotland still locked in battle for a place in the knockout round, any decision to cancel that game will have a huge impact on the final placings. That decision will be taken on the day of the game. If Japan's match in Yokohama is cancelled, the hosts would go into the quarter-finals for the first time. Organisers received immediate criticism for the cancellations, with former World Cup winner Francois Pienaar telling Sky Sports: \"Everybody has worked so hard. Why, if you work that hard and prepare yourself, let weather influence the outcome of the match? It shouldn't.\" Simon Learey, a British fan here, said he had flown out for the England-France game after getting the tickets as a birthday present. \"Very disappointed, we're only here four days, only to see that game,\" said Learey. But World Rugby's Gilpin said safety had to be the determining factor in these decisions. \"We fully appreciate that England, France, New Zealand and Italy fans will be disappointed, but we trust they will appreciate that their safety must come first,\" he said. Japan's Meteorological Agency said Hagibis was currently \"a large and violent typhoon\" and while it will weaken before hitting the mainland, it will \"remain very strong\" and have a \"significant impact over large areas\". Hagibis is currently forecast to clip the southeastern corner of Japan near Tokyo and Yokohama but given its size, the impact will be felt across wide swathes of the country. Formula One organisers also said they were \"closely monitoring\" the potential impact of Hagibis ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, southwest of Tokyo.

Japan's Meteorological Agency said Hagibis was currently \"a large and violent typhoon\" and while it will weaken before hitting the mainland, it will \"remain very strong\" and have a \"significant impact over large areas\". Hagibis is currently forecast to clip the southeastern corner of Japan near Tokyo and Yokohama but given its size, the impact will be felt across wide swathes of the country. Formula One organisers also said they were \"closely monitoring\" the potential impact of Hagibis ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, southwest of Tokyo.

Many people in Chiba, east of Tokyo, are still recovering from Typhoon Faxai, which struck Japan in early September and caused widespread disruption, leaving two people dead and cutting power to half-a-million homes.

Organisers of Sunday's Japanese Formula One Grand Prix, obviously mindful of the fact that driver Jules Bianchi died after a crash at Suzuka in 2014 when the track was soaked by Typhoon Phanfone, are closely monitoring the situation, while a 2020 Olympics BMX cycling test event has been brought forward. Gilpin defended the decision to hold the tournament, the first to be hosted in Asia, at this time of year. \"We always knew there would be risks but it's rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year,\" he said, adding that he did not feel the integrity of the tournament had been compromised. \"We have no regrets.\" CANCELLED GAMES Tournament regulations state that cancelled games are ruled a 0-0 draw, with two points going to each team. That would be enough to ensure Japan reach the quarter-finals if their game falls victim to the typhoon, which might look like some sort of sporting karma to their supporters. Four years ago Japan beat South Africa in the biggest upset in rugby history but then became the first team to fail to reach the knockout round after winning three pool games, being edged out on bonus points by Scotland. A decision on whether that match will be played is set to be made early on Sunday and the Scottish Rugby Union said it expected the game to go ahead. \"Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch and will be flexible to accommodate this,\" the SRU said on Twitter. Coach Gregor Townsend added: \"I hope everyone involved in the tournament wants the game to be played and will do their utmost for the game to be played. We have got to believe, and have faith in the organisers, even if it is behind closed doors or played at a different venue.\" Ireland are due to play their final game against Samoa on Saturday knowing a bonus point victory would ensure progress. A win without a bonus point, or even a bonus point in defeat, would also send the Irish through if Japan's game is called off. Italy finished third behind New Zealand and South Africa after their match against the All Blacks was cancelled leaving an angry Parisse to question the tournament regulations. \"If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled,\" said the man who has been the backbone of Italian rugby for years. \"It is ridiculous that there was no Plan B, because it isn't news that typhoons hit Japan. \"Sure, everyone might think that Italy v New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we'd have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team.\" Coach Conor O'Shea said the players' reaction to the news was \"horrible.\" \"Their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field,\" he said. New Zealand finish top of the group with South Africa going through as runners-up. Thursday's decision marks the first time a World Cup match has been cancelled since the tournament started in 1987. The 1995 semi-final between hosts South Africa and France was delayed by an hour due to a waterlogged pitch, but famously went ahead after a team of cleaning ladies took to it with brooms.

At least six people have died and more than 700 homes destroyed. </p><p>In early December, a spokesperson for the New South Wales department of environment declared that the bushfires and dust have caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen\" in Australia.

Bushfires are common in Australia, but scientists say this year's season has come earlier and with more intensity due to a prolonged drought fuelled by climate change. The fires have spawned numerous headlines, putting the spotlight on everything from the fate of golf's prestigious Australian Open to that of the hundreds of koalas living in the fire zone.

In May, Cyclone Fani made landfall, killing at least 34 in India and five in Bangladesh. One of the most powerful storms to hit the area in years, the cyclone destroyed houses, ripped off roofs and cut off power, water and telecommunications. Later in November, the destruction from Cyclone Bulbul killed at least 20 people in Bangladesh. More than 2 million were evacuated from their homes. Bangladesh's low-lying coast, as well as India's east are regularly faced with clones. In recent decades, at least hundreds of thousands of people living around the Bay of Bengal have been killed. HEATWAVE IN EUROPE A ferocious heatwave smashed records across Europe in the middle of the year, with the temperature in France surpassing 45 degrees Celsius for the first time on record. The country, along with Spain, Italy and parts of central Europe were particularly hit by the soaring temperatures. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands all saw new temperature records as well.

FLOODING IN VENICE On top of sweltering summer temperatures, Venice was also hit with bouts of intense flooding as it neared the end of the year. The UNESCO World Heritage Site was hit by multiple major floods in less than a week, with water levels hitting their highest in half a century, at one point leaving about 80 per cent of the city submerged.

Rhys Patchell has backed up Biggar at flyhalf but Gatland was unsure who he would have in reserve if Patchell went down. \"I don't know, we'll probably sit down as coaches and look at that,\" he said. \"Some players are going to have to back up (against Uruguay), we may have a 6-2 (forwards-backs) split. \"We've got players who will be a little unfamiliar but we have been running players at training in those positions. \"With the short turnaround we need to freshen some players up and hopefully we're good enough to do the job on Sunday to secure this group.\" Gatland played down concerns over Adams and Davies as \"dead legs\" but said linchpin centre Davies would be taken for a scan, having been struck on the knee in a collision. The costly bonus point win put Wales top of Pool D ahead of second-placed Australia. Victory over emerging nation Uruguay would ensure Wales stay top and enjoy a potentially kinder route through the quarter-finals against the runner-up of Pool C. Pool C rivals England and France are scheduled to play off for top spot in Yokohama on Saturday but the match has been thrown in doubt by the approaching Typhoon Hagibis. Although Wales will be forced into player management contingencies ahead of the knockouts, Gatland was thrilled with his team's ability to rally twice from behind in a see-sawing and highly entertaining contest against the Fijians. \"It was tough but there was some real character displayed,\" he said. \"We're absolutely delighted (to be in the quarter-finals).

They were convincingly beaten 19-12 by hosts Japan in the biggest shock of this World Cup and few of their fans were impressed with the 35-0 win over Russia in their last start. However, with a nine-day break between matches, they have had plenty of time to fix problems and rest bodies.

Centre Robbie Henshaw will play his first World Cup match in Japan after recovering from a hamstring strain and has been thrown straight into the centres with Bundee Aki, one of 11 changes to the starting side against Russia.

Predicted to be one of the most violent storms to hit the region recently, Hagibis is threatening to batter Tokyo with the heaviest rain and wind seen in 60 years. Suzuka, located about 300 km to the southwest of the capital, is also expected to be hit hard by the passing storm. \"It makes no sense to ask the spectators to come on track and then to be in a big mess,\" said Alfa Romeo team boss Frederic Vasseur. \"We already thought about this yesterday evening honestly. \"OK, it will change the programme but I think we can afford the weekend with two free practices.\" Formula One is no stranger to dealing with inclement weather in Japan.

The 2014 edition of the race, during which Jules Bianchi suffered ultimately fatal head injuries, was held in the wet with rain from the approaching Typhoon Phanfone drenching the track. After Friday's two practice sessions, which were run in overcast but dry conditions, teams and organisers worked to prepare for the coming storm. The starting lights and broadcast screens around the track were taken down, the broadcast centre was dismantled and the equipment moved to the main pit building. The podium was also packed away. Temporary grandstands were rearranged so the wind would pass through them. Organisers handed out sandbags in case of flooding. Teams anchored their hospitality units down with pegs drilled into the asphalt, wall panels in the garages were being taken down, garage doors were shuttered, and pit wall gantries were secured. Champions Mercedes said they would also take down screens and speaker systems installed in their hospitality unit and lift most of their garage equipment off the floor to avoid flood damage. Organisers said the circuit would be closed to the public and media on Saturday, but key people from the governing FIA and commercial rights holders FOM would remain at the track to make sure critical systems were kept running. \"Things are more complicated but certainly a great challenge,\" said Binotto. \"But I'm pretty sure it should be a good show and spectacle on Sunday.\" (Reporting by Abhishek Takle; editing by Peter Rutherford/Alan Baldwin/Toby Davis) - Reuters</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["SUZUKA, Japan: Formula One team bosses backed the decision of Japanese Grand Prix organisers to cancel all of Saturday's practice and qualifying sessions as the sport hunkered down to ride out Typhoon Hagibis.

Japan beat tier one rugby nations Scotland and Ireland en route to their first ever World Cup quarter-final, a feat that coach Jamie Joseph has stressed was a result of experience gained by playing more established teams. Japan played the likes of England, New Zealand, Ireland and France in the two years building up to the World Cup.

By having an open mind ... to ensure that there is an aspirational pathway for countries.\" Japan will play England and Ireland in the next 12 months, but the future is less clear for some developing countries. Minnows Namibia did not play a single fixture against a tier one nation in the four years since the last World Cup and they have no matches against the top teams scheduled. DARE TO DREAM As well as inspiring other smaller rugby nations with their play on the field, Japan's successful hosting of the World Cup vindicates World Rugby's decision in 2009 to award the tournament to a nation outside the sport's traditional heartlands for the first time.

Dallaglio, who won the 2003 World Cup with England playing at number eight, believes New Zealand represents the biggest challenge yet for Eddie Jones' side but that recent improvements in the back row could prove decisive. England flankers Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have impressed so far in the tournament, with the former winning man of the match in the quarter-final victory over Australia. However, they, along with England number eight Billy Vunipola, will have their work cut out against a vastly experienced New Zealand back row that includes captain Kieran Read and flanker Ardie Savea, a candidate for player of the tournament. </p><p>\"I have been impressed with both back rows,\" Dallaglio told Reuters on Tuesday. \"Let's not forget Kieran Read is pretty tidy himself, quite handy and done a few things in rugby, and then Billy Vunipola is quite a special player. \"So it's a wonderful battle within the war.\" As Dallaglio knows from England's success in 2003, the whole forward pack has to work as one unit if they are to free up the flankers to work their magic as traditional number sevens, breakdown specialists adept at turning over the ball. \"The whole pack is a unit and if the front five, the tight five, go well then it allows the back row to play in a very different way,\" said Dallaglio. \"It's a really intriguing battle within the match itself and one that - obviously I am slightly biased - I am quite looking forward to and hard to pick a winner.\" MORE TO COME FROM ENGLAND England have won all four of their matches so far at this World Cup, but as the pool stage match against France was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis and Argentina were reduced to 14 men early in their encounter, the team had a lot to prove heading into the quarter-final. Dallaglio thinks England answered any questions \"emphatically\" with a 40-16 win over Australia, but more will be needed against reigning world champions New Zealand. \"Like Eddie (Jones) and probably like a lot of England fans I think hopefully the best is yet to come,\" he said. \"There is a lot more left in this England side.\" England managed its way through the pool stages without facing a really challenging encounter, he said, but stepped up well against what he described as a \"good\" Australian side. \"At times they played exceptionally well and they will take a lot of confidence from that,\" Dallaglio said. \"They are certainly on-plan and they obviously now have to go up another level as well against the best side in the world.\" New Zealand, who have won 18 World Cup matches in a row, boast plenty of winning experience within their ranks, not least at head coach, with Steve Hansen aiming to become the first man to lead his team to back-to-back titles. However, Dallaglio sees Jones as England's possible trump card with the Australian aiming to reach his third World Cup final. Jones was beaten by Dallaglio's England as Australia's head coach in the 2003 final, before becoming an advisor for South Africa during their 2007 World Cup win. \"This is Eddie Jones' fourth World Cup as a coach or head coach,\" said Dallaglio. \"This is his moment as a coach and he knows he has a team that are capable of going all the way to the final and winning it.\" (Reporting by Jack Tarrant; editing by Richard Pullin) - Reuters</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["\"Let's not forget Kieran Read is pretty tidy himself, quite handy and done a few things in rugby, and then Billy Vunipola is quite a special player. \"So it's a wonderful battle within the war.

Berkshire benefited as resilience in consumer spending helped cause U.S. economic growth to slow less than expected, offsetting a contraction in business investment. But rising stock prices are still impeding Buffett's efforts to find places to invest. Berkshire ended September with a record US$128.2 billion of cash, despite repurchasing US$700 million of stock in the quarter. </p><p>Buffett has gone nearly four years since making a major acquisition for Berkshire, whose stock price has lagged the broader market by the most since 2009. \"There is a growing frustration among investors that the cash hoard is not being effectively deployed,\" Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York, said after Berkshire released its results. \"The flip side is that Berkshire's stock tends to do well when the economy softens.\" Seifert also said Berkshire's sprawl means results will often mirror macroeconomic trends. \"It's not surprising that tariffs had a negative impact on its consumer and industrial businesses,\" she said. Seifert rates Berkshire \"hold.\" Berkshire said third-quarter operating income rose 14per cent to US$7.86 billion, or roughly US$4,816 per Class A share, from US$6.88 billion, or roughly US$4,189 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected operating profit of US$4,405.16 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. Net income fell 11per cent to US$16.52 billion, or US$10,119 per Class A share, from US$18.54 billion, or US$11,280 per share, reflecting fewer gains from Berkshire's investments. A U.S. accounting rule requires earnings to reflect unrealized gains, including on Berkshire's respective US$57 billion and US$27.8 billion stakes in Apple Inc and Bank of America Corp . Buffett said the resulting volatility can mislead investors. Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and operates more than 90 businesses including the Geico auto insurer, BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and its namesake energy company and real estate brokerage. Class A shares of Berkshire closed Friday at US$323,400, up 5.7per cent in 2019, lagging the 22.3per cent gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 . Class B shares closed at US$215.83, also up 5.7per cent. TARIFFS WEIGH U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 1.9per cent annualized rate in the third quarter, the Department of Commerce said on Wednesday in its advance estimate of economic growth. But the Federal Reserve on the same day nevertheless lowered interest rates for the third time this year amid uncertainty over trade policy, slowing global growth and Great Britain's proposed exit from the European Union. BNSF, one of Berkshire's largest businesses, was able to boost profit 5per cent to US$1.47 billion. The railroad's cost-cutting helped offset lower revenue as demand for consumer, coal, industrial and agricultural products declined, the latter in part because of new trade policies. Berkshire also blamed U.S. tariffs for cutting into sales of gas turbine and pipe products by its Precision Castparts unit. Insurance underwriting profit was essentially unchanged at US$440 million, as improved results from reinsurance offset higher loss claims at Geico. Berkshire warned that Typhoon Hagibis, which caused widespread damage in Japan last month, will likely hurt fourth-quarter underwriting results. Nevertheless, float, a major driver of Berkshire's growth that reflects insurance premiums collected before claims are paid, rose about US$2 billion in the quarter to US$127 billion. Profit from manufacturing, services and retailing rose 2per cent, to US$2.46 billion, as higher sales from Berkshire's auto dealer and Clayton Homes mobile home units offset lower revenue from the Duracell battery, Forest River RV, and apparel and footwear businesses. Tax credits, meanwhile, helped Berkshire Hathaway Energy boost profit 8per cent, to US$1.18 billion.

Small groups of people waited at the Imperial Palace gate on Tuesday in pouring rain, waving Japanese flags and cheering a smiling Naruhito as he entered by car. The first Japanese emperor born after World War II, Naruhito acceded to the throne when his father, Akihito, became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries after worrying that advancing age might make it hard to perform official duties. \"As he is young and energetic with outstanding leadership, I hope he'll support the people of Japan, which has faced continuous disasters and typhoons,\" said Tomoko Shirakawa, 51, who was waiting in front of the palace. Naruhito began the day's ceremonies by reporting his enthronement to his imperial ancestors at one of three shrines on the palace grounds, dressed in a black headdress and pure white robes with a long train borne by an attendant. He was followed later by Empress Masako, dressed in 12-layered white robes and attended by two women in violet robes to arrange her train. TRADITION-BOUND CEREMONY For the main ceremony, Naruhito will wear a traditional burnt-orange robe and headdress, as his father did nearly three decades ago. It will start at 1pm local time (12pm Singapore time) at the Imperial Palace's Matsu no ma, or Hall of Pine, the most prestigious space in the palace. He will declare his enthronement from the \"Takamikura\" - a 6.5m high pavilion that weighs about 8 tonnes - with an ancient sword and a jewel, two of the so-called Three Sacred Treasures, placed beside him. Together with a mirror called Yata-no-Kagami, which is kept at the Ise Grand Shrine, the holiest site in Japan's Shinto religion, the three treasures comprise the regalia that symbolises the legitimacy of the emperor. Masako will also take part in the ceremony, gaining her own throne while wearing 12-layered robes and an elaborate hairstyle. Akihito pledged during his own ceremony in 1990 to observe Japan's pacifist constitution and fulfill his duty as a symbol of the state and for the unity of the people. Naruhito promised to follow his father's path and observers have noted he has so far made only small changes. \"It'll be nice if the new emperor will be as kind hearted as the former emperor and stay close to the people,\" said Ryoya Suzuki, 25, in front of the palace. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to deliver a congratulatory speech before guests including Britain's Prince Charles, who with then-wife Princess Diana attended Akihito's enthronement, as well as U.S. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao. Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi is also expected to take part. A court banquet will be held on Tuesday night, before Naruhito and Masako host a tea party for foreign royalty on Wednesday afternoon. A celebratory parade has been postponed until Nov 10 while the government devotes its attention to coping with the aftermath of the typhoon.

If it can't take place on Sunday then we're really, really pressing the point that we need to have to get this game delayed 24 hours.\" Dodson said that he had made little progress despite constant dialogue with tournament organisers, describing the concept of a further cancellation as \"absolutely unacceptable\". He added that the SRU had taken legal opinion that \"unravels the World Rugby case\". Asked if it was too late to mount a legal challenge, he said: \"We don't know that - we have to challenge it. Rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby. \"The common sense approach to this is to play the game 24 hours later in perfect safety, where we can make sure that the pool stages are completed and the sporting integrity of the tournament remains intact.\" Many Scots fear that there is little chance of a change, believing that World Rugby are favouring the home nation as they desperately want a tier two team, and particularly the host nation, in the knockout phase. CROOKED FEED They are also still stinging from the 2015 tournament when they were denied a place in the semi-finals by an incorrect last-minute penalty that handed Australia victory at Twickenham. Last week too there was general incredulity when Samoa were penalised for a crooked scrum feed in the last minute of the match against Japan - the only time a referee has punished the offence in the whole tournament. Japan were allowed to regain possession and went on to score the fourth try they needed for a bonus point that could prove decisive - at Scotland's expense - if Sunday's game goes ahead. And it is not just the Scots who raised an eyebrow at the Pool A schedule, which gives Japan a week between each of their matches while everyone else in the tournament has at least one short turnaround. Meanwhile, fans who bought tickets for the cancelled matches through official channels have already received emails saying refunds will be paid automatically to their account. Tickets bought from \"unauthorised secondary sources\" will not be refunded. In addition to matches being called off, the typhoon's impact on transportation in Japan has also left fans frustrated. Some Australian supporters have had to miss their team's game against Georgia in Shizuoka on Friday because planned train cancellations meant they would not have been able to get back to Tokyo for their flights home.

The three-times champions, who ran in seven tries and had effectively secured victory by halftime, went into the encounter having lost two of their last three matches against the Irish but this superb performance reflected their overall record against the men in green, now standing at 29 wins, two defeats and one draw.

Some 2,000 guests, including foreign dignitaries and royalty, stood at the sound of a deep drum beat before the proclamation began. \"I swear that I will act according to the constitution and fulfil my responsibility as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people,\" the 59-year-old declared, his voice slightly hoarse, in front of guests. \"I sincerely hope that Japan will develop further and contribute to the friendship and peace of the international community, and to the welfare and prosperity of human beings through the people's wisdom and ceaseless efforts.\" When the ceremony was complete, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cried \"Banzai!\" (\"Long live the emperor\") three times. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/ChannelNewsAsia/posts/10156791876842934?__tn__=-R\">https://www.facebook.com/ChannelNewsAsia/posts/10156791876842934?__tn__=-R</url> BANQUETS PLANNED Naruhito officially assumed his duties as emperor on May 1, the day after his father became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries. But the transition was not complete until his new role was officially proclaimed. In the wake of Typhoon Hagibis, the government postponed a royal parade until Nov 10, but the rest of the day's ceremonies were left unchanged. Naruhito began the day by \"reporting\" the proclamation to deities and his ancestors in the ancient royal dynasty, wearing a voluminous white robe and a rarely seen black hat complete with a tail extending up 60cm at the back of his head.

I feel a new page has been turned for the royal family,\" she added. Oxford-educated Naruhito faces a delicate balancing act as emperor, seeking to continue his father's legacy of bringing the monarchy closer to the people while upholding the centuries-old traditions of the Chrysanthemum Throne. And the royal line faces its own challenges, with a dearth of successors thanks to rules that prevent women from inheriting the throne. The royal couple have one child, a 17-year-old daughter called Aiko. Naruhito's brother Akishino is currently crown prince. And Akishino's son - 13-year-old Hisahito - is currently the only other remaining successor. There have been calls to revise the succession rules, but so far there have been no formal moves. Despite the succession worries, the royals remain broadly popular.

But there's a catch: There are more shovels than hands. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has agreed to use US$6.5 million (5.07 million pounds) for immediate disaster relief, looks set to tap into budget reserves of US$5 billion, and may request more money to finance construction after Typhoon Hagibis tore through much of Japan's main island this month, killing 79 with seven still missing. \"We'll take fiscal steps, including a supplementary budget if necessary, so that disaster-hit local governments can do the utmost on rebuilding,\" Abe said. </p><p>But however much Abe spends, a severe labour shortage means his government will struggle to repair levee breaks and other damage across a broad swath of the country. Construction is one of the most squeezed industries in the nation's tightest job market since the 1970s. As Japan's population greys and shrinks, the supply of construction workers has slumped by 28 per cent from its peak in the late 1990s to around 5 million. Yet demand remains robust amid a nearly seven-year economic expansion and the approach of next year's the Tokyo Olympics. The construction industry has 5.3 job openings for every applicant, latest government data show, a ratio second only to that of security guards and far above the overall ratio of 1.6, which is the highest in decades. LABOUR CRUNCH The scale of Hagibis, in which 71 rivers burst 140 levees and other embankments over vast areas from Nagano, central Japan to Iwate in the far northeast of the main island, means the job of fixing the damage is vast. \"We are absolutely short of workers,\" said Yoshiaki Suzuki, president of the six-man construction firm Suzuki Kenzai Kogyo in Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo, which flooded three times since early September. Tateyama, where Suzuki lives, was still recovering from massive flooding and long power outages caused by Typhoon Faxai last month when Hagibis hit on Oct 12 to Oct 13. On Friday and Saturday, a third storm inundated the city, killing 10 in Chiba Prefecture and dumping as much as 283.5mm (11 inches) of rain on some areas over 12 hours. \"Our top priority is to restore lifelines, repair roads and cover the damaged roofs with blue plastic sheets,\" Suzuki told Reuters. \"There's no time for removing the heaps of rubble caused by the last two typhoons.\" Destabilised soil from earlier storms has led to fresh landslides, making work hazardous for people still digging out, he said. The shortage of construction workers is most pronounced in rural Japan, where the population and construction projects are in steep decline. Highly skilled workers tend to head to bigger cities, said Fumitaka Miura, director at the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, a private think-tank. GOING HIGH-TECH To address the worker shortage, some construction companies are embracing technology. For example, some companies fly drones over construction sites for three-dimensional measuring. The data is fed into machines that design, plan and implement projects, say officials at the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry. These \"i-Construction\" techniques can cut working hours by 30 per cent, they say. Technological solutions like these are deployed in 60 per cent of large-scale construction projects, the officials say. But most of the disaster recovery will be done with bricks, mortar, equipment and manual labour. Speculation is mounting that Abe may ask for more funds in an extra budget at the end of the year, as the longest postwar economic boom sputters amid global trade wars and the government watches the impact of a sales tax increase this month. Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, says the government is likely to earmark US$5 billion-US$10 billion for infrastructure rebuilding, while longtime Japan strategist Jesper Koll forecasts something more like US$20 billion to US$30 billion, given the \"need for fast and decisive government action.\" - Reuters</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["TOKYO: Ravaged by a series of storms, including the worst typhoon in decades, Japan is ramping up spending on rescue, repair and clean-up.

The Finn crossed the line 11.3 seconds ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who made a hesitant start from pole position and had to fend off a charging Lewis Hamilton in the closing laps. The result moved Mercedes 177 points clear of Ferrari, allowing them to wrap up a record-equalling sixth consecutive constructors' crown, with a maximum 176 points from four races still to be won. It also assured Mercedes of the drivers' title with only Bottas now capable of challenging five-times world champion Hamilton, whose lead narrowed to 64 points. </p><p>Mercedes have now equalled Ferrari's record six constructors' titles in a row between 1999-2004. The Italian team won five successive drivers' crowns with Michael Schumacher from 2000-04. \"Starting third is never easy here but there's no point giving up,\" said Bottas after his third win of the season and first since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April. \"I had a really nice car and Sebastian had an issue, so it was good to get the lead. Really proud of the team, a sixth title in a row is so impressive.\" Ferrari looked like they might delay the title celebrations after locking out the front row in a qualifying session held on Sunday morning, after being postponed from its traditional Saturday slot due to Typhoon Hagibis. But both Vettel and team mate Charles Leclerc ran into trouble at the start. Vettel launched off his grid spot a fraction too soon and slammed on the brakes before moving again. He was investigated for a false start but let off without a sanction because his car had not crossed the line. The momentary hesitation was enough to allow Bottas to sweep around the outside and into the lead. Leclerc collided with Max Verstappen as the Dutchman tried to pass around the outside, damaging the Ferrari and pushing the Red Bull, which later retired, into a spin. The Monegasque nevertheless carried on, crucially holding up Hamilton as his car shed bodywork in a shower of debris before eventually pitting for repairs at the end of the third lap. PENALTIES Leclerc, 21 and winner of two of the last five races, crossed the line sixth but dropped to seventh behind Renault's Daniel Ricciardo after being slapped with two post-race time penalties. He collected a five-second penalty for the Verstappen incident and a further 10 seconds for continuing to drive a car deemed to be in an unsafe condition. Ferrari were also fined 25,000 euros (US$27,600) for the latter offence while Leclerc was given two penalty points on his superlicence. Ricciardo and 10th-placed team mate Nico Hulkenberg could still drop back, however, with Racing Point lodging a protest against the French manufacturer for an alleged brake bias infringement. \"The lights were on but it was my mistake (at the start),\" said Vettel, a four-time winner at Suzuka. \"The Mercedes were difficult, they had more pace than us and Valtteri was flying. I'm not happy with the start of the race but everything else was fine, just lacked a bit of pace.\" Hamilton's joy at Mercedes's success was muted after the team gambled on a one-stop strategy for the Briton, even as Bottas and Vettel opted for two. With tyre degradation higher than expected, the 34-year-old was forced to pit a second time and lost track position to Vettel. \"Firstly, congratulations to the team,\" said Hamilton, who can still clinch the drivers' title at the next race in Mexico. \"That's the main point. I just wanted to bring home good points for the team.\" LAP EARLY The race officially ran for only 52 of 53 scheduled laps after the chequered flag was shown a lap early on the digital displays around the track. Drivers, who did not see the chequered flag display on their steering wheel dashboards, continued to race around but the order at the end of the 52nd lap was declared as the result. As a result, Mexican Sergio Perez retained his ninth place finish for Racing Point, despite crashing out after contact with Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly at the start of the final lap.

Wing Kenki Fukuoka led the way with two tries, while Kotaro Matsushima and Keita Inagaki also scored as the hosts held off a fierce second-half assault from a team they had lost against in all seven of their previous meetings. When Japan beat South Africa four years ago - having won only one of their previous 24 World Cup matches - it was considered the greatest shock in rugby history. This time, having already beaten Ireland three weeks ago, it did not even feel like a real surprise. </p><p>They were faster, sharper, more inventive and, roared on by the vast majority of the delirious red-and-white-clad crowd, absolutely relentless in everything they did as they became the first tier-two team to reach the last eight since Fiji in 2007. Having won all four of their matches to top Pool A with 19 points, they will face the Springboks again in the quarter-finals and the twice-champions will be taking absolutely nothing for granted. The result also meant that Ireland, through as runners-up on 16 points, will play New Zealand. \"Tonight we went another level,\" said Japan coach Jamie Joseph. \"They wanted it as much as the Scots and gave as much as they could. This is what it takes to win big test matches.\" The match was given the go-ahead only on Sunday morning after an inspection of the damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis and proved a wonderfully uplifting occasion for the country after the death and destruction wrought by the storm. \"Whilst we are celebrating tonight there are a lot of people who aren't,\" Joseph said. Captain Michael Leitch said that the victory owed more to heart than skill and while that might be true of their mighty defensive effort in the final quarter, no team in the tournament so far has come close to matching the pace and directness of Japan's first-half assault. EXPLOSION OF NOISE Scotland were first on the board with a Finn Russell try after seven minutes but Japan hit back with a brilliantly-worked, high-tempo score that set the tone for the night as Fukuoka tore clear and slung a one-armed pass into the arms of the supporting Matsushima to detonate an explosion of noise. If that was good, their next score was a contender for try of the tournament. Fukuoka and Matsushima again put on the afterburners and then a mesmerizing series of off-loads and side-steps ended with Shota Horie presenting supporting prop Inagaki with an unmissable opportunity. Japan were playing with a speed and intensity that the Scots just could not live with and got a third try at the end of the half when Tim Lafaele slipped through a deft grubber that bounced perfectly into the arms of Fukuoka. It was then bedlam two minutes into the second half when Fukuoka stripped Chris Harris and galloped clear for a fourth and bonus-point clinching try. The Scots, who came from 31-0 down to draw 38-38 with England in the Six Nations in March, channelled that Twickenham spirit as WP Nel and Zander Fagerson scored to get back within seven points with 25 minutes to go but with the bonus-point situation, they still needed more than two converted tries to advance. It was relentless Scottish pressure and desperate, at times demented, Japanese defending from then on, but the hosts held out for another famous victory in what became a deafening cauldron of noise. It was only the second time Scotland have failed to reach the last eight - the other coming in 2011 - but they can have few complaints, bookending wins over Russia and Samoa with defeats by Ireland and the hosts. \"We had a mountain to climb after that first half but we started climbing it and I thought the effort the players put in to get back to within seven points was excellent,\" said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend. \"We were obviously aware that this was huge for the home nation.

READ: Fans mingle, tension mounts ahead of World Cup final READ: 'Plan for everything': Rugby World Cup's advice to Tokyo Olympics An incredible 54 million people tuned into Japanese television - a record for any rugby game - to watch the national team, nicknamed the Brave Blossoms, defeat Scotland to progress to the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time in nine attempts. UNITING A NATION The performance and tournament as a whole gave a nation still recovering from Typhoon Hagibis, which killed over 80 people and left thousands homeless in October, something to get behind. It was reminiscent of that stunning win by the Japanese women's football team of the 2011 World Cup just four months after the country had suffered a devastating earthquake and tsunami. Eight years on from that terrible day when the city of Kamaishi saw 1,300 of its residents killed, the city hosted two World Cup games at the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium, which sits on the site of a school washed away in 2011. Such is the power of sport. This World Cup also showed that there is a new power in the world of rugby. The game has been slow to move from its heartlands of the United Kingdom, France, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand but Japan has been a breath of fresh air. \"One of the reasons we came to Asia was to actually leave a legacy,\" Mr Beaumont added. \"What we have to do is carry on working with them so when you come back in two years' time, the people are talking about (Brave) Blossoms and not about baseball.\" That is still a worry. After years of defeat at the World Cup, Japan shocked the world by defeating South Africa at the 2015 World Cup in England and winning three games in total. This awakened interest in the country but the excitement quickly faded away. Four years on, the World Cup has ignited a rugby fever in Japan much more widespread and intense than before. Its rugby bosses are determined not to miss the opportunity this time round. A NEW RUGBY COMPETITION IN JAPANJapanese officials are looking to revamp the structure of the domestic league to make it stronger on and off the field. In October, Katsuyuki Kiyomiya, the vice president of the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU), told reporters that he will hold a news conference in November to announce plans to launch a new domestic competition expected to start in 2021. \"This World Cup is a big event Japanese rugby has not experienced before and we are tested on how we take the excitement and enthusiasm created by this event to the next level,\" Mr Kiyomiya said. Details will follow but reports suggest there will be a new, professional 12-team league run. It will give the current Top League, a low-key affair with teams owned by corporations such as Panasonic, Toshiba and Toyota almost as a public service, a run for their money. This new league will likely run on a separate calendar to Super Rugby (the southern hemisphere competition that features clubs from South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) and would aim to attract top players from that tournament. With interest in Japan at an all-time high, Mr Kiyomiya said that the league looks to generate an annual revenue of 50 billion yen (US$460 million) through sponsorship and the sale of media rights. If so, clubs would not only be able to attract talent from the traditional rugby powerhouse nations but would also be able to offer the best players in Asia the chance to pursue a lucrative career in the sport. HELPING ASIA It will help Asia's rugby aspirations for Japan to continue its ascendance. The success of Japan could serve as an example and an inspiration to its neighbours. Japan is the only Asian nation to ever appear at the World Cup. It is head and shoulders ahead of the next best teams including Hong Kong, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia. READ: Memorable moments from Japan's World Cup If World Rugby can increase representation at the World Cup for Asia, there will be more interest and investment in the sport from Asian nations, past the amateur and semi-professional level. Japan will benefit from sharpening its craft, if Asia has its own competitive rugby games. Therefore, it is also in Japan's interest that Asia improves at the game. For now, no doubt Japan's journey serves as an inspiration, but that journey is going to be long. The Brave Blossoms won just one game in its first seven World Cups from 1987 to 2011, suffering some demoralising thrashings along the way. That feels a long time ago now. If the passion that has been on display in recent weeks can be harnessed, Japan can become a force to be reckoned with - wherever the World Cup takes place.
