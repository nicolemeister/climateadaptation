By early Saturday (Oct 26), four people had died and two were missing in Chiba prefecture, just east of Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK reported. Landslides ripped waterlogged areas in the region, inundated by its third rainstorm in six weeks, and in some places a month's worth of rain fell in half a day. </p><p>Evacuation orders and advisories were issued along much of the northern corridor already hit by two typhoons since last month. The city of Ushiku in Chiba received 283.5mm of rain over 12 hours. Authorities warned of the chance of further landslides and floods, especially in areas hit by levee breaks that have yet to be repaired after Hagibis lashed central and eastern Japan with heavy rains and high winds. That typhoon killed at least 82 people, with nearly a dozen still missing and more than 300 injured.

Evacuation orders were issued for at least 80,000 people in Chiba, where rivers were rising precariously close to their banks. Most trains services in Chiba were halted, leaving travellers stranded at stations, NHK said. Parts of Chiba were drenched by 86mm of rain in an hour on Friday morning, with some areas receiving more than a month of rain in one day. Much of Chiba lost power, in some cases for weeks, in Typhoon Faxai in September and then were hit by heavy rains due to Hagibis. The government also asked 340,205 people to evacuate their homes in Fukushima prefecture because of possible landslides.

Total rainfall in the area around Tokyo was likely to reach around 200 to 300mm by evening, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Some flights to Tokyo were diverted because of the downpour, NHK said. Tropical storm Bualoi, which battered the Ogasawara islands south of the main Japanese archipelago on Thursday while still at typhoon strength, was heading out into the Pacific and expected to weaken to a tropical depression later on Friday. - Reuters/nh</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12036448</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBY-9811-JCDN-14F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><timeReceived>11:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Italy's slim hopes of staying in the tournament were wrecked by Thursday's decision to scrap the Pool B match in Toyota. Both teams were awarded two points, meaning world champions New Zealand will move on as pool winners while Italy go home. </p><p>Hansen said that while having the match called off was frustrating, World Rugby had no other option. \"The reality is we can't control the weather,\" Hansen said. \"Do we charge on and put people's lives at risk, or do we lead and make a decision that's around making sure people are safe? \"It's a no-brainer.\" England's final first-round match against France was also called off due to the typhoon, the first World Cup fixtures ever to be cancelled. Having already lost to South Africa, Italy's path to the quarter-finals would have involved the unlikely scenario of them beating the All Blacks for the first time. Hansen said all teams had been aware of the procedure in the event of a typhoon striking Japan, which is why it had been important to take maximum points throughout the tournament. \"If you want to be really ruthless, then it's all about making sure you win the games on the way through because everyone knew this could be a possibility,\" he added. \"That's pretty hard-nosed, though, because I know if we were in their situation, we'd be disappointed not to have the opportunity to get there. \"So yes, there's a lot of sympathy for them. But the right decisions are being made, because it's all about safety.\" Typhoons are not unusual in Japan in autumn but Hansen backed World Rugby's decision to put on the tournament, the first to be held in Asia, in its usual slot in the calendar. \"It's always a risk at this time of year with the typhoons, but this is when we play the Rugby World Cup,\" he said. \"If you play it earlier, you run the risk of people dying on the footy field because it'll be 40 degrees. \"If you play it later, then that's when we are finished for Christmas so you'd have Santa Claus giving us the World Cup.\" - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11988704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-CMW1-DYWP-R3T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"375\"/><timeReceived>9:40 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

He said his understanding of the rules was that the day of the match could not be changed. But he said had also been told \"things can change\" if a force majeure is declared under \"exceptional circumstances\", and he did not know whether that could yet make Monday a possible date. </p><p>Rugby World Cup organisers took the unprecedented step of cancelling the England-France clash in Yokohama and New Zealand-Italy game in Toyota City on Saturday because of the expected destructive effects of the typhoon. With the storm expected to have passed through by Sunday, a decision on the Pool A clash between the tournament hosts and Scotland would not be made until the morning of the game. \"We believe that the game hasn't been cancelled because the weather will be better on Sunday and it looks like the game will be played,\" Townsend told reporters in Hamamatsu. \"That's what we have to put faith in, that they have made that call with a lot of certainty and confidence that the game will be played on Sunday night.\" Tournament regulations state that cancelled games are ruled a 0-0 draw, with two points going to each team, which would end Scotland's hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. Townsend's side need to win the game, preferably with a bonus point, to ensure they advance. The host nation would qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time if their match in Yokohama is called off. Townsend said that early indications of the typhoon were that it might not hit Yokohama until Sunday and that World Rugby had mentioned the possibility of moving the match. Scottish media reported the team had been quietly hoping for a shift to Kobe if that was the case. \"Maybe yesterday, when it looked like the weather was going to be rougher on Sunday, there seemed to be discussion about looking at an alternative venue,\" Townsend said. \"The way I read the rules was you can't change days, but you could change venues - contingencies would be in place. \"I have since been told there is force majeure (rule), that things can change because of exceptional circumstances,\" he said. \"If that means Monday because it takes a day for things (infrastructure) to be put back in order, then who knows. \"But just now I think they are planning for it to go ahead on Sunday,\" he said.

The scratching of Sunday's match in Yokohama due to Typhoon Hagibis would have eliminated the Scots from the tournament and SRU chief Mark Dodson threatened legal action to enforce a postponement. Dodson had also said organisers would have taken action to ensure the match went ahead if it had involved world champions New Zealand, comments which could lead to a charge of bringing the game into disrepute. </p><p>\"Under our tournament rules, we're very careful that people behave appropriately and as a result of that we've referred to independent disputes committee the behaviour and comments of the Scottish Rugby Union,\" tournament director Alan Gilpin told a news conference. In the event, the match went ahead just a few hours after the typhoon ripped through Tokyo, with the host nation winning 28-21 to qualify for the quarter-finals and send the Scots home. Gilpin hailed the work of the organising committee and local governments for getting the match on and the 67,666 crowd safely in and out of the stadium so quickly after the worst typhoon to hit the region in decades. \"Putting any match on is an incredibly complex task on that scale but to do so in those circumstances is remarkable,\" he added. \"We know they are remarkable, which is why we had a high degree of optimism that we could get this done. \"There were people in the venue working in different roles and volunteers whose homes had been destroyed that day. Their desire to get the game on and resilience is to be absolutely applauded.\" World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont also paid tribute to the organising committee and offered his sympathies to those affected by a typhoon, which has cost at least 66 lives. \"In many ways, Japan's victory over Scotland was for a nation, not just rugby,\" he said. \"It reflected the wonderful human warmth and family spirit that has characterised this Rugby World Cup. The Japanese people are the heartbeat of the tournament and have welcomed the teams and fans with open arms.\" Three matches on the final weekend of the pool did fall victim to the weather and Japan Rugby Chief Executive Akira Shimazu said that was a matter of regret. \"It gave us a lot of sadness and we would like to sincerely apologise for that,\" he said. World Rugby said Asia's first World Cup continued to break records with 1.8 million tickets sold - 99per cent of those available - 863,000 people crowding into fan zones and 200,000 Japan team replica shirts sold. Chief Executive Brett Gosper said the Japan television audience for Sunday's match was tracking to exceed the 50 million mark - a first for a rugby game.

The tropical storm, categorised as a 'super-typhoon', is predicted to be one of the most violent to hit the region in recent years and expected to strike the Tokyo area this weekend. The 5.8-km Suzuka track, located about 300 km south-west of Tokyo, is expected to feel the brunt of it on Saturday, jeopardising the final practice session and qualifying, which decides the starting order for Sunday's race. </p><p>The storm's approach has already forced the cancellation of two rugby World Cup matches. F1 organisers on Thursday held off on a decision about whether to cancel Saturday's racing, saying they were working to minimise disruption to the weekend timetable and keeping a close eye on the advance of the storm, with safety the top priority. \"I think it's pretty clear if the typhoon is going to come here there's no way we can drive,\" said Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, whose godfather Jules Bianchi suffered ultimately fatal head injuries in a crash at the 2014 Japanese race after rain from the approaching Typhoon Phanfone drenched the track. \"But in my previous experience... they've always been quite safe with the conditions. They've always asked what we thought about the track once we're in the car. So, yeah, happy. We'll see,\" added the 21-year-old Monegasque. Formula One is no stranger to dealing with inclement weather in Japan. In 2004 Typhoon Ma-on forced qualifying to be postponed to Sunday. Another storm in 2010 at Suzuka and in 2015 at the U.S. Grand Prix similarly delayed qualifying by a day. All track running for the local Formula Four support category has been cancelled for the weekend, allowing Formula One more flexibility in planning its schedule if needed. \"There is a forecast, but how many times have forecasts changed?\" said Ferrari's four-time champion Sebastian Vettel. \"Currently it sits at a 100per cent so it's quite clear. \"It would make sense if by tomorrow (Friday) at night, there is more evidence to give a proposal, or take an action for Saturday.\" Five times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who leads Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas by 73 points in the overall standings with five races left, said he was sure organisers were prepared. \"I think they do the utmost they can. I'm sure they already have procedures in place to move it (qualifying) to the Sunday morning.\" (Reporting by Abhishek Takle; editing by Peter Rutherford and Ken Ferris) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11989604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-CMW1-DYWP-R3SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"442\"/><timeReceived>1:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

A large part of the reason the Wallabies are facing the English this weekend is that Wales raced away to a 23-8 halftime lead in the crunch Tokyo match that effectively decided the winners of Pool D. Australia fought back to within one point in the second half, but the Welsh held on to win 29-25 and now face France on Sunday at the same Oita Stadium where the Wallabies take on England on Saturday. Hooper said the Australians had talked about \"what starting well actually looks like\" and he had come to the conclusion that it does not necessarily mean getting a torrent of points on the board in the first half an hour. </p><p>\"I've started to believe that starting well means preparing well for the back end of the game, when it opens up a bit,\" he said. \"Starting well means sticking to your principles early, not getting flustered by things that are happening, not getting flustered by the scoreboard because you don't win the game at halftime. \"Yeah, we want to start to start well. What's that actually look like? Looks like sticking to our processes and playing the game we want to play with whatever comes at us in that period.\" Hooper will link up with David Pocock against England duo Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in an intriguing back row battle featuring four openside flankers. The Australia skipper said he had been confused by the inconsistency of some of the refereeing around the ruck at the World Cup, but thought it would be a hard-fought contest. \"It's going to be a good battle, a good battle. Every Friday you get asked about the back-row combinations,\" he said. \"The ruck's a great part of the game, as always, it's going be a huge part of a test match tomorrow.\" Hooper dismissed as \"an unknown\" the idea that England, whose final pool match against France was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis, might have benefited from a couple of weeks off since their last match. However well their opponents had prepared, though, Hooper said Australia would also be raring to go as they look to book a place in the semi-finals for a third successive World Cup and snap a six-match losing streak against England. \"I'm nervous, but that's good because it means you care,\" he said. \"I feel alive, I feel ready to go.\" (Editing by Alex Richardson) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12013230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9B-52Y1-DYWP-R0K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"416\"/><timeReceived>9:25 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Hodge is available after serving a three-match ban for a high tackle against Fiji, having missed the defeat to Pool D rivals Wales and wins over Uruguay and Georgia. The Wallabies bunkered down at their hotel in Odawara in central Honshu on Saturday, not far from Hakone where nearly a metre of rain pounded down as Typhoon Hagibis passed over. </p><p>There was a bowling alley and a karaoke room in the basement of their hotel, where the players tested the sound-proofing with renditions of radio-friendly rock songs. \"So there were a few good renditions of Nickelback, a few duets going down in the karaoke room last night which was good fun,\" Hodge said on Sunday. \"It was good to make our minds off rugby for a good few hours. \"There are a few guys who will try to claim they are (the best singers) but there were a few terrible renditions of songs going round there, I think.\" Hodge said teenage team mate Jordan Petaia, fresh from his try-scoring debut on the wing against Uruguay, was one of the stand-outs as he launched into a song by Grammy-winning hip hop artist Eminem. \"Jordie Petaia's 'Lose Yourself' was pretty impressive. He was getting it going there,\" said Hodge. Away from the tropical north, cyclones are a rarity in Australia and Sydney-born Hodge said it was an \"interesting experience\" listening to the typhoon whistle through the hotel's windows. \"Just a shout-out to everyone in Japan in the affected areas. Hopefully everyone's bunkered down well and remains as safe as possible,\" he said. Australia are on track to play England in the quarter-finals, unless Wales slip up against emerging rugby nation Uruguay later on Saturday. There will be fierce competition among the squad to claim a starting berth for the match in Oita next weekend, particularly among the back three. \"You only had to see what Marika (Koroibete) did on the weekend with his opportunity there ... to know that we're in a good spot as a back three,\" said Hodge, referring to his winger team mate who conjured a breath-taking try against Georgia. \"Now that I'm back in the mix, hopefully we can kind of keep working as a unit and get the result this week.\" Being sidelined was tough for Hodge, but it had given him plenty of time to work on his tackling technique. \"I learned my lesson that it is going to be quite harsh if you stray from that kind of goal so I'll definitely be trying to tackle low this weekend for sure,\" he said.

Piutau, who was celebrating his 34th birthday in his 43rd and final test at his third World Cup, scored a try and kicked the last conversion at Hanazono Rugby Stadium as the Tongans finished off their tournament in style. Tongan prop Siegfried Fisi'ihoi opened the scoring and centre Malietoa Hingano crossed to give the Pacific islanders the lead around the hour mark, with fullback Telusa Veainu adding the fourth try after the final gong. </p><p>Replacement Mike Te'o had scored two tries with his first two touches in four first-half minutes to give the United States a 12-7 halftime lead and flanker Tony Lamborn added a try two minutes from time, but the Americans will go home winless. For much of the 80 minutes it was easy to remember that these were two teams that had failed to secure a victory between them in six previous matches, albeit in a tough Pool C that also include England, France and Argentina. After a moment's silence to remember those affected by Typhoon Hagibis, which ripped through the Tokyo area overnight, the Tongans looked desperate to make the quick start that had eluded them in their previous matches. A combination of poor choices in attack kept them off the scoresheet until the 17th minute when winger Viliami Lolohea shoved aside a couple of tacklers for a 40-metre break and Fisi'ihoi forced his way over the line. Two minutes later Eagles skipper Blaine Scully was forced off injured and replaced by Te'o, who plays scrumhalf, winger and fullback but has the build of a prop. The Californian had immediate impact on the right wing, taking a sublime one-handed offload from number eight Cam Dolan to score his first try before adding a second from a similar position after a lofted pass from fullback Will Hooley. The Tongans came out firing in the second half to try and reel in the Eagles but more poor decision-making saw them waste overlap after overlap. Sonatane Takulua took a shot at goal to cut the deficit to three points in the 51st minute and Hingano got the Tongans back in front when a hack through from a turnover found no one at home in the U.S. defence seven minutes later. Piutau found a gap in the same defence to slide through and score his try four minutes later but the Americans have always shown plenty of fight in this tournament and they got some reward in 78th minute. The Eagles pack forced their way to the line and Lamborn touched the ball against the base of the post for a try that gave them hopes of unlikely victory, only for the Tongans to score again through Veainu.

Henshaw missed Ireland's matches against Scotland, Japan and Russia as he recovered from a hamstring strain but will start in the number 13 jersey outside Bundee Aki in one of 11 changes to the starting side that beat the Russians 35-0 in Kobe. Tadhg Beirne, who moves to the back row, Jonny Sexton, Aki and Keith Earls, who switches wings, are the only players to retain their places. </p><p>Joe Schmidt's team are seeking the bonus-point victory in Fukuoka that would ensure a place in the quarter-finals. Ireland are second in the group on 11 points behind Japan (14 points), whose match against Scotland (10) in Yokohama on Sunday has been thrown into doubt due to Typhoon Hagibis. Tournament regulations state that cancelled games are ruled a 0-0 draw, with two points going to each team. If Scotland's game is cancelled they would move on to 12 points, meaning Ireland would need to pick up at least a losing bonus point from the Samoa game to be assured of a place in the last eight along with Japan. Ireland beat Scotland in their pool opener, giving them the head-to-head edge. \"For us, business as usual,\" Schmidt told reporters at the team hotel in Fukuoka on Thursday. \"We can't really control what happens with the Scotland-Japan game. So, on Saturday evening we need to get our business done as best as we can.\" Hooker Rory Best will start and take back the captaincy from flyhalf Johnny Sexton, with scrumhalf Conor Murray also promoted from the bench to face the already eliminated Samoans, who were beaten 38-19 by Japan in their last pool clash. Jordan Larmour will start at fullback as Rob Kearney recovers from a groin strain suffered against Russia, with Keith Earls and Jacob Stockdale completing the back three that started the 27-3 win over Scotland. Schmidt said the typhoon had proved an unwelcome distraction for his team after training on Thursday, as players discussed the various scenarios that could arise. Final round pool matches between France and England, and New Zealand and Italy, have been cancelled for safety reasons, resulting in the elimination of the Italians. \"So when we get down to the captain's run tomorrow we will hopefully be on task,\" Schmidt said. \"Once you actually get to the ground and you know the immediacy of a match, it tends to focus the mind.\" Team: 15-Jordan Larmour, 14-Keith Earls, 13-Robbie Henshaw, 12-Bundee Aki, 11-Jacob Stockdale, 10-Johnny Sexton, 9-Conor Murray, 8-CJ Stander, 7-Josh van der Flier, 6-Tadgh Beirne, 5-James Ryan, 4-Iain Henderson, 3-Tadgh Furlong, 2-Rory Best (capt), 1-Cian Healy Replacements: 16-Niall Scannell, 17-Dave Kilcoyne, 18-Andrew Porter, 19-Jean Kleyn, 20-Peter O'Mahony, 21-Luke McGrath, 22-Joey Carbery, 23-Andrew Conway (Editing by Peter Rutherford) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11988506</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-CMW1-DYWP-R3T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><timeReceived>8:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Biggar has been ruled out of the last pool game against Uruguay on Sunday after being forced from the field in the second half at Oita Stadium following a sickening collision with team mate Liam Williams. There are further concerns over hat-trick hero Josh Adams and centre Jonathan Davies, with both suffering leg injuries. </p><p>\"He (Biggar) didn't do an HIA (head injury assessment), it was just because of the contact (that) he was just removed from the field,\" Gatland said of Biggar's injury at the post-match media conference. \"Which means he's not in consideration for Sunday and he'll have to go through the protocols and we'll probably have to get someone in to have a look at him as well.\" It was Biggar's second head knock at the tournament after he was taken from the field following a collision with Australia centre Samu Kerevi during the previous pool win in Tokyo. Rhys Patchell has backed up Biggar at flyhalf but Gatland was unsure who he would have in reserve if Patchell went down. \"I don't know, we'll probably sit down as coaches and look at that,\" he said. \"Some players are going to have to back up (against Uruguay), we may have a 6-2 (forwards-backs) split. \"We've got players who will be a little unfamiliar but we have been running players at training in those positions. \"With the short turnaround we need to freshen some players up and hopefully we're good enough to do the job on Sunday to secure this group.\" Gatland played down concerns over Adams and Davies as \"dead legs\" but said linchpin centre Davies would be taken for a scan, having been struck on the knee in a collision. The costly bonus point win put Wales top of Pool D ahead of second-placed Australia. Victory over emerging nation Uruguay would ensure Wales stay top and enjoy a potentially kinder route through the quarter-finals against the runner-up of Pool C. Pool C rivals England and France are scheduled to play off for top spot in Yokohama on Saturday but the match has been thrown in doubt by the approaching Typhoon Hagibis. Although Wales will be forced into player management contingencies ahead of the knockouts, Gatland was thrilled with his team's ability to rally twice from behind in a see-sawing and highly entertaining contest against the Fijians. \"It was tough but there was some real character displayed,\" he said. \"We're absolutely delighted (to be in the quarter-finals). I think everyone's fear is to try to get out of your pool.\" (Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Ken Ferris) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11986074</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7D-DFB1-DYWP-R1W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><timeReceived>2:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

With their final pool game against France cancelled at the weekend due to the approach of Typhoon Hagibis, England will face the Wallabies on Saturday not having played since Oct. 5 when they beat Argentina 39-10. Even that game, which came on the back of comfortable wins over Tonga and the United States, was pretty straightforward after an early red card took the sting out of the Pumas. </p><p>While some have seized on the long layoff as a possible weakness in their preparations, fullback Elliot Daly said the squad were \"firing\" after full-on training sessions. \"It was good to get training as quickly as possible. To get down there (short-term base in Miyazaki) and have a good three days to make sure we are ready for this week, firing, was what we needed to do,\" he told a news conference on Tuesday. \"The way we train is to mimic games and the way we have trained over the last three or four weeks especially and playing games at the weekend has gone really well for us. \"There is a lot of energy on the training pitch. We had to rein it back a bit today because the boys were getting a bit too excited. That is the overarching theme for everybody - excited to see where we can take this.\" Number eight Billy Vunipola took part in that session and looks to be recovering well from his sprained ankle, but winger Jack Nowell missed out and is a doubt for the game. Assistant coach John Mitchell said it was very likely Vunipola would be fit. \"He is a very important player to us,\" Mitchell said. \"He loves to get the ball in his hands and he is very good at regaining and retaining momentum.\" Should Vunipola not make it, Mark Wilson, named England's player of the series after the November internationals where he chiefly played at the back of the scrum, is the likely replacement. Despite heading into the match on the back of six successive wins against the Wallabies, Mitchell said he was in no doubt that they would bring something unexpected to the party in a bid to end that streak. \"At the end of the day, having witnessed a number of teams play against Australia and also played against them myself as a youngster, they have always been highly intellectual in the way that they play the game and have always been clever and it something that I respect,\" Mitchell said. \"They always have the ability to surprise.

The match, which will decide the outcome of Pool A, is still scheduled to go ahead on Sunday despite the impact of Typhoon Hagibis, which made landfall on Sunday. World Rugby and tournament organisers will make a decision on whether the match goes ahead on Sunday morning once the damage following the typhoon has been assessed. </p><p>In the meantime, Scotland are cooped up in their hotel in Yokohama and must battle through an unprecedented preparation for a match. They must also overcome the mental hurdle of playing against the host nation in a decisive match. \"It will be a sense that it is us against 70,000 people,\" said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend on Friday. \"When you play Japan in the World Cup you are the away team, all the other games are neutral.\" \"I think we will be going into an atmosphere that will be fairly passionate for the opposition and we have to play as well as we can to win that game.\" \"They will get energy from the crowd and we will have to take away their energy.\" Although Scotland were embarrassed against France in Nice in one their two World Cup warm-up matches away from home, Townsend instead pointed to the 36-9 victory over Georgia in Tbilsi as the blueprint for his players to follow on Sunday. \"The way the players approached that game in Georgia was how we want to see them approach this game over the next two days, knowing that the crowd will have an influence and bring a lot of energy,\" he said. \"The opposition will get a lot of energy from that so we have to stick to what we know will work in the game and what will work for us.\" Scotland have qualified for the World Cup knockout stages at every tournament bar one coming into Japan 2019 but know they must win by eight points or more to qualify from Pool A ahead of the hosts. Weather conditions aside, the two teams both play a chaotic, speedy brand of rugby and access to quick ball could be pivotal on Sunday. Townsend praised the Brave Blossoms for their quick ball ability but also said they didn't always achieve that legally. \"There are a lot of aspects to a game of rugby and playing at a high tempo and generating quick ball is just one aspect and I would say Japan are one of the best teams in the world at doing that,\" said Townsend. \"They do things at the ruck that creates a lot of quick ball, not always legal, and we know they have a very effective way of getting quick ball there.\" Scotland beat Japan 45-10 at the England 2015 Rugby World Cup.

Wales coach Warren Gatland has ruled out first-choice flyhalf Dan Biggar after he suffered his second head knock of the tournament in a sickening collision with team mate Liam Williams during the 29-17 win against Fiji. Linchpin centre Jonathan Davies is also sidelined with a knee issue along with winger George North (ankle), Gatland said on Friday as he unveiled a starting team with 13 changes from the one that played Fiji. </p><p>Rhys Patchell is slotting in for Biggar in the number 10 shirt at Kumamoto Stadium but Gatland was cagey about backup options, with no other specialist flyhalves to call on. \"It's a bit of a juggling act,\" said Gatland, who has brought back the rested Justin Tipuric in the back row and named him captain. \"We knew from the start that we were going to expose a few players. \"We've probably got a nine (scrumhalf) who can step in there.\" Victory over Uruguay will mean taking on France in the quarter-finals, which may be preferable to Eddie Jones's well-drilled England given Les Bleus' shaky form through the pool phase. Both France and England will have had two weeks to rest before the quarter-final due to Super Typhoon Hagibis cancelling their scheduled pool game on Saturday. Gatland said it was an \"interesting dilemma\" for world number seven France. \"Some teams will welcome it. For us, it's about continuing the momentum and building on that,\" he said. \"Hopefully after Sunday we can think about getting down to Oita and preparing for a Sunday game against France. \"They would be very tough but we have to do a job this Sunday first.\" The Six Nations champions will have a number of players looking to impress their coach ahead of the knockouts, including winger Hallam Amos in what will be his World Cup debut and 22-year-old centre Owen Watkin, who steps in for Davies. Even with a patched-up backline, Wales should have too many weapons for emerging rugby nation Uruguay, who have already exceeded expectations in Japan after upsetting Pacific power Fiji. Beaten 45-10 by Australia in their previous pool game in Oita, the South Americans will hope a stronger finish against the Welsh can boost their credibility and lead to more games against tier-one nations during the next World Cup cycle. \"This team has established a base in every way, from which we have to continue building,\" said Uruguay flanker Franco Lamanna. \"We have met our expectations, but we are not satisfied and we want to improve what can be improved in the next game.\" (Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Toby Davis) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11992396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7V-BTC1-JCDN-1143-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><timeReceived>10:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Australia have lost all six tests against England since Jones took over after the last World Cup and will face them in the last eight in Japan unless Uruguay can spring a sensational upset of Wales on Sunday. Cheika has sometimes appeared exasperated by his one-time Randwick team mate's mastery of the provocative media soundbite, especially during the June series of 2016 which England swept 3-0. Asked after Australia's win over Georgia on Friday whether the cancellation of England's final pool match against France because of Typhoon Hagibis was the advantage Jones had suggested it was, Cheika fired back a tart response. </p><p>\"I saw that he was saying that would be an advantage and that the typhoon gods were smiling on him,\" Cheika said. \"So I suppose they better win - they've had the best preparation according to their coach, so they better go out there and win.\" Cheika was also asked whether England's six-match winning streak would make them favourites for the expected quarter-final clash, which will take place in Oita next Saturday. \"I don't know what relevance it will have - I don't know if it'll have any. I don't really care to be honest,\" he said. \"The only relevance is Saturday. That's pretty much about it, it doesn't matter who's had a week off, who's had a week on, who's been resting, who hasn't. \"It'll all come down to what happens on kick-off.\" Cheika's Australia knocked England out of their own tournament the last time the two teams met at the World Cup in 2015 but this Wallabies side does not appear to have the same cohesion as the one that reached the final four years ago. The laboured 27-8 win over Georgia followed a comeback 39-21 victory over Fiji, a 29-25 tight loss to Wales and a straightforward 45-10 win against lowly-ranked Uruguay. Cheika has tried to make a virtue out of his constant tinkering with the team in Japan but appears no closer to identifying his starter in the key flyhalf position. Christian Lealiifano, Bernard Foley and Matt To'omua have all had a go with the latter wearing the number 10 shirt against the Georgians. \"I thought he was solid, he gave good direction, it's his first time there since last year,\" Cheika said. \"I thought he gave good direction to the forwards, his chat was good. He was solid in difficult conditions. \"Like every week, I'll sit down with the selectors, look at the pros and cons of each player according to the team we're playing that week, and look at the best combination to do that.\" - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11994158</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X80-P121-JCDN-1032-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><timeReceived>4:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Ireland need a bonus point win against the Samoans in Fukuoka to be sure of a quarter-final spot but their final resting place in Pool A may be taken out of their hands. The Scotland-Japan game in Yokohama on Sunday is under threat from the super typhoon and if cancelled - like two other pool matches that were scheduled on Saturday - Ireland's best hope will be finishing runners-up in the group behind the hosts. </p><p>While that would still ensure quarter-final action, Joe Schmidt's team would end up facing the defending champions New Zealand rather than the potentially more attractive prospect of Pool B runners-up South Africa. Schmidt said the players' minds had naturally wandered after World Rugby confirmed the seriousness of the typhoon on Thursday by calling off the France-England and New Zealand-Italy pool matches. \"Any time there is something up in the air and something is unknown... you get players who are going to talk about that,\" Schmidt told reporters. \"But we've got to make sure, as I said, that our game gets finished with the right result for us. I'm sure the Samoans are coming out to make sure that's as difficult for us as possible.\" In the southwestern island of Kyushu, Fukuoka is far from the expected trajectory of the typhoon, giving Ireland a chance to find form against the already eliminated Samoans before the knockout rounds. POOR SHOWING Since thrashing Scotland 27-3 in their opening pool match, Ireland have had a surprisingly poor World Cup as one of the pre-tournament favourites. They were convincingly beaten 19-12 by hosts Japan in the biggest shock of this World Cup and few of their fans were impressed with the 35-0 win over Russia in their last start. However, with a nine-day break between matches, they have had plenty of time to fix problems and rest bodies. While one bonus point from a loss would be enough to reach the last eight, Schmidt has fielded a strong side for their first World Cup clash against Samoa and first test against them since Ireland's 40-9 win in Dublin in 2013. Centre Robbie Henshaw will play his first World Cup match in Japan after recovering from a hamstring strain and has been thrown straight into the centres with Bundee Aki, one of 11 changes to the starting side against Russia. The match will be special for Aki, who was born in New Zealand to Samoan parents but joined Irish side Connacht in 2014 and qualified for Ireland on residency. Samoa, beaten 38-19 by Japan in their last pool clash, will be desperate to beat a tier one nation, having seen Tonga push France to the wall and Fiji give Wales a fright on Wednesday. \"What better opportunity to finish the World Cup?\" Samoa coach Steve Jackson said. \"Knowing that we're on an airplane on Monday, going home, to have a scalp like that would be great.\" (Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Ken Ferris) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11989328</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-CMW1-DYWP-R3SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><timeReceived>12:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Stuart McInally, who skippered the team in their first two games, was left on the bench and was replaced at hooker by Fraser Brown in one of 12 changes made by Townsend for the must-win match from the second-string side who beat Russia on Wednesday. Although the Japan match may be cancelled due to the impact of Typhoon Hagibis , Scotland are trying to get ready for the encounter as normal and Townsend wants the experienced Laidlaw to lead the team through the unprecedented preparation. </p><p>The form of Brown, who has impressed in Scotland's wins over Russia and Samoa, was also a key factor in Townsend's decision. \"(McInally is) not in his best form,\" said Townsend in Yokohama on Friday. \"He was much better in the Samoa game compared to the Ireland game and there are a number of players that didn't perform in the Ireland game. \"Fraser has been excellent as soon as he came back from injury.\" \"We have seen Stuart improving in training and in the two games he played so we believe he can have a real impact in the second half.\" Laidlaw, who has made 73 appearances for his country and captained Scotland on four previous occasions at a World Cup, is happy to take on the responsibility. \"I am probably the most experienced player within the team,\" he said. \"It is a big game so I am more than happy to take on the responsibility but effectively it changes nothing. \"We have a test match to win and that is what we are all concentrating on.\" Sean Maitland lost his battle to be fit for the match, meaning Tommy Seymour and Darcy Graham start on the wings with Stuart Hogg and Finn Russell looking to bring further experience and guile into the team. If Scotland beat Japan by eight points or more, then they will qualify for the quarter-finals. They have only failed to make it out of the pool stages once previously at a World Cup, in 2011. \"This is a game that I think a lot of people are looking forward to,\" said Townsend. \"We have talked about it being one of those rare occasions where you get to play in a game which is a straight shootout for the quarter-finals, obviously with the proviso that we score more than seven points more than Japan, against the home nation, against a team that is playing really well.\" \"It is a game you dream to be involved in.\" Team: 15-Stuart Hogg, 14-Tommy Seymour, 13-Chris Harris, 12-Sam Johnson, 11-Darcy Graham, 10-Finn Russell, 9-Greig Laidlaw (captain), 8-Blade Thomson, 7-Jamie Ritchie, 6-Magnus Bradbury, 5-Jonny Gray, 4-Grant Gilchrist, 3-Willem Nel, 2-Fraser Brown, 1-Allan Dell Replacements: 16-Stuart McInally, 17-Gordon Reid, 18-Zander Fagerson, 19-Scott Cummings, 20-Ryan Wilson, 21-George Horne, 22-Peter Horne, 23-Blair Kinghorn - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11992936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7V-BTC1-JCDN-113W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"486\"/><timeReceived>1:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Originally scheduled for 3 p.m. on Saturday (0600 GMT), the hour-long qualifying session that decides the grid order for the race will now be held at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Sunday, a revised schedule issued by organisers showed. Final practice, which would normally take place before qualifying, has been scrapped. </p><p>The race, the 17th of 21 this season, is set to go ahead as planned at 2.10 p.m. (0510 GMT) on Sunday at the Suzuka circuit. \"I think it's a shame for the fans but it's a fully respectable decision,\" said Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto. \"Safety is first.\" Hagibis, which means 'speed' in the Philippine language Tagalog, is due to make landfall on the main island of Honshu on Saturday. It has already forced the cancellation of two rugby World Cup matches. Predicted to be one of the most violent storms to hit the region recently, Hagibis is threatening to batter Tokyo with the heaviest rain and wind seen in 60 years. Suzuka, located about 300 km to the southwest of the capital, is also expected to be hit hard by the passing storm. \"It makes no sense to ask the spectators to come on track and then to be in a big mess,\" said Alfa Romeo team boss Frederic Vasseur. \"We already thought about this yesterday evening honestly. \"OK, it will change the programme but I think we can afford the weekend with two free practices.\" Formula One is no stranger to dealing with inclement weather in Japan. In 2004 Typhoon Ma-on forced qualifying to be postponed to Sunday while another storm in 2010 similarly delayed qualifying by a day. The 2014 edition of the race, during which Jules Bianchi suffered ultimately fatal head injuries, was held in the wet with rain from the approaching Typhoon Phanfone drenching the track. After Friday's two practice sessions, which were run in overcast but dry conditions, teams and organisers worked to prepare for the coming storm. The starting lights and broadcast screens around the track were taken down, the broadcast centre was dismantled and the equipment moved to the main pit building. The podium was also packed away. Temporary grandstands were rearranged so the wind would pass through them. Organisers handed out sandbags in case of flooding. Teams anchored their hospitality units down with pegs drilled into the asphalt, wall panels in the garages were being taken down, garage doors were shuttered, and pit wall gantries were secured. Champions Mercedes said they would also take down screens and speaker systems installed in their hospitality unit and lift most of their garage equipment off the floor to avoid flood damage. Organisers said the circuit would be closed to the public and media on Saturday, but key people from the governing FIA and commercial rights holders FOM would remain at the track to make sure critical systems were kept running. \"Things are more complicated but certainly a great challenge,\" said Binotto. \"But I'm pretty sure it should be a good show and spectacle on Sunday.\" (Reporting by Abhishek Takle; editing by Peter Rutherford/Alan Baldwin/Toby Davis) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11991080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7S-PV81-JCDN-10FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><timeReceived>2:20 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Japan beat tier one rugby nations Scotland and Ireland en route to their first ever World Cup quarter-final, a feat that coach Jamie Joseph has stressed was a result of experience gained by playing more established teams. Japan played the likes of England, New Zealand, Ireland and France in the two years building up to the World Cup. World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont said on Sunday it would be a priority for Japan and other tier two nations to play more matches against the top teams, including newly-crowned world champions South Africa. </p><p>\"There has been much talk about the future of the Brave Blossoms (Japan rugby union team),\" Beaumont said at the tournament's closing press conference. \"Our message is clear; we will do everything in our power to support them and all emerging teams to get regular access and meaningful fixtures in high level competitions.\" \"Certainly, by ensuring that there are more fixtures between tier one and tier two we will continue to improve the standard.\" \"That is what we are going to do. By having an open mind ... to ensure that there is an aspirational pathway for countries.\" Japan will play England and Ireland in the next 12 months, but the future is less clear for some developing countries. Minnows Namibia did not play a single fixture against a tier one nation in the four years since the last World Cup and they have no matches against the top teams scheduled. DARE TO DREAM As well as inspiring other smaller rugby nations with their play on the field, Japan's successful hosting of the World Cup vindicates World Rugby's decision in 2009 to award the tournament to a nation outside the sport's traditional heartlands for the first time. Despite several matches having to be cancelled due to the impact of Typhoon Hagibis, the tournament's organisation has been widely praised. World Rugby CEO Brett Gosper hailed it as \"probably been the greatest Rugby World Cup\" ever. World Rugby confirmed on Sunday that it would be running the bidding process for both the 2027 and 2031 World Cups simultaneously, a policy it hopes encourages more developing nations to follow in Japan's footsteps. \"Japan 2019 showed the power of a nation that really did dare to dream by hosting this,\" said Gosper. \"They have been magnificent hosts, warm hosts and we really hope other unions find the courage now to throw their hat in the ring to host a Rugby World Cup, perhaps as an emerging nation.\" \"I hope also that it gives courage to World Rugby to be bold in decisions as they were in 2009 when they chose Japan as a host nation.\" Argentina and North America have been mooted as possible future hosts as World Rugby looks to expand the game into new continents when it opens the bidding process next year. \"It is correct and right that we as an organisation we look at new areas,\" said Beaumont. \"When we came here to Japan, nobody would have thought that it would have been... the outstanding success that it has.\" \"It does give us the opportunity to look at South America, North America, Canada and certainly that is part of our long-term planning.\" France has already been chosen to host the 2023 World Cup.

Madam Halimah, who returns to Singapore on Thursday, was among the more than 2,000 head of states invited to witness the centuries-old ceremony. Naruhito, 59, acceded to the throne in May after his father, Akihito, became the first monarch to abdicate in two centuries.

In the evening, the president and her spouse, Mr Mohamed Abdullah Alhabshee, attended a banquet hosted by Mr Abe and Mrs Abe at Hotel New Otani Tokyo, said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). On Wednesday morning, Mdm Halimah met up with Mr Yasuhisa Shiozaki, chairman of the Japan-Singapore Parliamentary Friendship League. \"President Halimah expressed appreciation for the members' efforts in promoting inter-parliamentary exchanges that contributed to the strong Singapore-Japan relationship,\" said MFA. \"They exchanged views on the common challenges facing Singapore and Japan, and the need for both countries to work together to support free trade and to tackle ageing population, technological disruption, and climate change,\" it added. She also visited Japanese electronics and IT giant NEC's Future Creation Hub, which showcases the company's advanced information and communications technologies, including AI and biometric identification solutions. \"Those areas are important and relevant for the growth of both Japan and Singapore. NEC is an example of continued linkage of Singapore and Japan, of trade and investment,\" Mdm Halimah told reporters. The president viewed exhibits that included a demonstration of biometric data-based identification for smooth and fast travel, safe and secure data exchange that protects the privacy of consumers, and a future shopping and distribution experience. Earlier that day, she mingled with Singaporeans and their families. She said to them: \"More than five decades ago, Japan was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Singapore. Today Japan is Singapore's third-largest foreign investor.\" An important pillar of Singapore-Japan relations is the close people-to-people linkages between both countries. \"(I am) glad that the Singaporean community has built close friendships and networks in Japan,\" she said.

Horne scored his first two tries from scrumhalf and added a third from the left wing as Scotland finally got their high-octane running game going in their third match in Japan. Flyhalf Adam Hastings, son of Scotland great Gavin, also made a significant contribution with the first two tries in four first-half minutes and eight conversions for a personal haul of 26 points. Horne actually crossed for what seemed like a Scottish record-equalling fourth try only for referee Wayne Barnes to call it back for a forward pass. </p><p>\"That's stage one of a two-stage week completed,\" Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said. \"As an all-round team performance, it was excellent.\" Neither Horne not Hastings are likely to start in Yokohama on Sunday when the Scots take on Japan almost certainly needing to record a victory and deprive the hosts of a bonus point to progress to the knockout stages. \"It'll be huge, our focus now is on recovery, making sure we get our preparation right for that game, and our selection,\" Townsend added. \"We've watched a lot of Japan, and I know they've watched a lot of us too. \"We've just got to make sure we deliver our best performance - we'll have to because Japan are a very good team.\" TYPHOON CONCERNS That match in Yokohama, however, is in danger of being disrupted by Typhoon Hagibis, which is projected to strike the Tokyo area on Saturday, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. Tournament rules state that any pool game that cannot be played is not rescheduled and instead is recorded as a 0-0 draw, with no bonus points available. Scotland made 14 changes from the team that beat Samoa 34-0 and many of the players had a dual goal of winning the game as well as trying to force their way into consideration for Sunday's match. Scotland's scoring in the first half came in an eight-minute burst with Hastings crossing twice, while Horne intercepted a flat pass by Dmitry Perov on his own tryline to give Scotland a 21-0 lead at the break. Horne then secured the bonus point after a brilliant weaving run of more than 60 metres from Darcy Graham, who was the only player who also started against Samoa. Russia then ran out of steam and their defence faltered as they missed 41 tackles with hooker George Turner and winger Tommy Seymour crossing before Horne completed his hat-trick with more than 20 minutes remaining. Match captain John Barclay brought up the half century, just the 13th time Scotland have surpassed 50 points in tests, when he burst free with about five minutes remaining. \"We enjoyed that one, sometimes those games can get a bit scrappy,\" Barclay said. \"We were a bit nervous about this game having seen what Russia did to other teams at the tournament but we prepared well, we were very professional, played the game we wanted to play and came away with a good result.\" Squad captain Stuart McInally completed the scoring, although Hastings did cross after the gong only for Barnes to again rule the try out. \"Scotland were quick and fast and had studied us well, they played well,\" Russia coach Lyn Jones said. \"We were hoping to finish with a flourish but so be it.\" - Reuters/nr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11985230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7D-DFB1-DYWP-R1WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><timeReceived>9:32 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Dallaglio, who won the 2003 World Cup with England playing at number eight, believes New Zealand represents the biggest challenge yet for Eddie Jones' side but that recent improvements in the back row could prove decisive. England flankers Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have impressed so far in the tournament, with the former winning man of the match in the quarter-final victory over Australia. However, they, along with England number eight Billy Vunipola, will have their work cut out against a vastly experienced New Zealand back row that includes captain Kieran Read and flanker Ardie Savea, a candidate for player of the tournament. </p><p>\"I have been impressed with both back rows,\" Dallaglio told Reuters on Tuesday. \"Let's not forget Kieran Read is pretty tidy himself, quite handy and done a few things in rugby, and then Billy Vunipola is quite a special player. \"So it's a wonderful battle within the war.\" As Dallaglio knows from England's success in 2003, the whole forward pack has to work as one unit if they are to free up the flankers to work their magic as traditional number sevens, breakdown specialists adept at turning over the ball. \"The whole pack is a unit and if the front five, the tight five, go well then it allows the back row to play in a very different way,\" said Dallaglio. \"It's a really intriguing battle within the match itself and one that - obviously I am slightly biased - I am quite looking forward to and hard to pick a winner.\" MORE TO COME FROM ENGLAND England have won all four of their matches so far at this World Cup, but as the pool stage match against France was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis and Argentina were reduced to 14 men early in their encounter, the team had a lot to prove heading into the quarter-final. Dallaglio thinks England answered any questions \"emphatically\" with a 40-16 win over Australia, but more will be needed against reigning world champions New Zealand. \"Like Eddie (Jones) and probably like a lot of England fans I think hopefully the best is yet to come,\" he said. \"There is a lot more left in this England side.\" England managed its way through the pool stages without facing a really challenging encounter, he said, but stepped up well against what he described as a \"good\" Australian side. \"At times they played exceptionally well and they will take a lot of confidence from that,\" Dallaglio said. \"They are certainly on-plan and they obviously now have to go up another level as well against the best side in the world.\" New Zealand, who have won 18 World Cup matches in a row, boast plenty of winning experience within their ranks, not least at head coach, with Steve Hansen aiming to become the first man to lead his team to back-to-back titles. However, Dallaglio sees Jones as England's possible trump card with the Australian aiming to reach his third World Cup final. Jones was beaten by Dallaglio's England as Australia's head coach in the 2003 final, before becoming an advisor for South Africa during their 2007 World Cup win. \"This is Eddie Jones' fourth World Cup as a coach or head coach,\" said Dallaglio. \"This is his moment as a coach and he knows he has a team that are capable of going all the way to the final and winning it.\" (Reporting by Jack Tarrant; editing by Richard Pullin) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12023420</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB4-CVV1-JCDN-10PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><timeReceived>4:41 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Because people in power are not doing enough to arrest climate change. One such angry voice is that of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg from Sweden. She has even bound her anger between the covers of a Penguin paperback: No One Is Too Small To Make A Difference. Like the Malay proverb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call to action, she wants the mountain built little by little (Sedikit-sedikit lama-lama jadi bukit). It is a cry for help. Why the desperation? There are at least two reasons for this despair.</p><p>One is to be found in Thunberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sweden. In a speech delivered at the Climate March in Stockholm on Sept 8 last year, Thunberg accused the Swedes of living a life that uses the resources of 4.2 planets. Sweden, she said, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stealing 3.2 years of natural resources from future generations every year\u00e2\u20ac. Little wonder it has a carbon footprint that is one of the 10 worst in the world. Hard to argue with this, especially when she was speaking with the authority of Swedish climate scientist Johan Rockstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Two, planet Earth is burning and \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to the discerning young eyes from Sweden to Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Neros of the world are playing the fiddle. Recent climate disasters bear this out. When this Leader was going to press, 140 bush fires were raging in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. One such, says the The Guardian of the United Kingdom, is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mega fire\u00e2\u20ac that is already the size of greater Sydney. Fire officers are saying the Sydney fire is too big to be put out.</p><p>Asia and Africa weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spared either. In China, Typhoon Lekima killed 72 in August sweeping through several provinces, causing severe floods and bringing down bridges and a dam. Typhoon Hagibis did the same in Japan in October, with 12 more deaths. Earlier in July, 162 died in a heatwave in Kumagaya near Tokyo. In India, 90 died in a heatwave in June, when temperatures hit 49\u00c2\u00baC. In March, Cyclone Idai, the deadliest storm ever to occur in the Southern Hemisphere \u00e2\u20ac\u201d according to US News \u00e2\u20ac\u201d killed 602 in Mozambique and 299 in Zimbabwe.</p><p>But fear alone would not get the climate job done. Fortunately, there is a business case for reducing our carbon footprint. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres has the numbers. Speaking to young climate activists in September last year, Guterres said, if we continued with our present lifestyle, it will cost the world US$2 trillion by 2030. Already, it is costing the United States US$240 billion a year to run its economy on fossil fuel. Investments against climate threats too come with a business case. Research by Global Center on Adaptation indicates investing US$1.8 trillion globally in five areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201d early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dry land agriculture, mangrove protection and investments in making water resources more resilient \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from 2020 to 2030 could generate US$7.1 trillion in total net benefits. The Thunbergs of the world are hoping that the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 25) meeting in Madrid, Spain now will, to borrow the words of Guterres, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153use it\u00e2\u20ac, not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lose it\u00e2\u20ac.</p><p>( END )</p><p>CLOSE to two billion young people around the world are angry.

Berkshire benefited as resilience in consumer spending helped cause U.S. economic growth to slow less than expected, offsetting a contraction in business investment. But rising stock prices are still impeding Buffett's efforts to find places to invest. Berkshire ended September with a record US$128.2 billion of cash, despite repurchasing US$700 million of stock in the quarter. </p><p>Buffett has gone nearly four years since making a major acquisition for Berkshire, whose stock price has lagged the broader market by the most since 2009. \"There is a growing frustration among investors that the cash hoard is not being effectively deployed,\" Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York, said after Berkshire released its results. \"The flip side is that Berkshire's stock tends to do well when the economy softens.\" Seifert also said Berkshire's sprawl means results will often mirror macroeconomic trends. \"It's not surprising that tariffs had a negative impact on its consumer and industrial businesses,\" she said. Seifert rates Berkshire \"hold.\" Berkshire said third-quarter operating income rose 14per cent to US$7.86 billion, or roughly US$4,816 per Class A share, from US$6.88 billion, or roughly US$4,189 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected operating profit of US$4,405.16 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. Net income fell 11per cent to US$16.52 billion, or US$10,119 per Class A share, from US$18.54 billion, or US$11,280 per share, reflecting fewer gains from Berkshire's investments. A U.S. accounting rule requires earnings to reflect unrealized gains, including on Berkshire's respective US$57 billion and US$27.8 billion stakes in Apple Inc and Bank of America Corp . Buffett said the resulting volatility can mislead investors. Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and operates more than 90 businesses including the Geico auto insurer, BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and its namesake energy company and real estate brokerage. Class A shares of Berkshire closed Friday at US$323,400, up 5.7per cent in 2019, lagging the 22.3per cent gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 . Class B shares closed at US$215.83, also up 5.7per cent. TARIFFS WEIGH U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 1.9per cent annualized rate in the third quarter, the Department of Commerce said on Wednesday in its advance estimate of economic growth. But the Federal Reserve on the same day nevertheless lowered interest rates for the third time this year amid uncertainty over trade policy, slowing global growth and Great Britain's proposed exit from the European Union. BNSF, one of Berkshire's largest businesses, was able to boost profit 5per cent to US$1.47 billion. The railroad's cost-cutting helped offset lower revenue as demand for consumer, coal, industrial and agricultural products declined, the latter in part because of new trade policies. Berkshire also blamed U.S. tariffs for cutting into sales of gas turbine and pipe products by its Precision Castparts unit. Insurance underwriting profit was essentially unchanged at US$440 million, as improved results from reinsurance offset higher loss claims at Geico. Berkshire warned that Typhoon Hagibis, which caused widespread damage in Japan last month, will likely hurt fourth-quarter underwriting results. Nevertheless, float, a major driver of Berkshire's growth that reflects insurance premiums collected before claims are paid, rose about US$2 billion in the quarter to US$127 billion. Profit from manufacturing, services and retailing rose 2per cent, to US$2.46 billion, as higher sales from Berkshire's auto dealer and Clayton Homes mobile home units offset lower revenue from the Duracell battery, Forest River RV, and apparel and footwear businesses. Tax credits, meanwhile, helped Berkshire Hathaway Energy boost profit 8per cent, to US$1.18 billion.

Naruhito, 59, and his Harvard-educated wife Empress Masako, 55, took over in May in a brief, tradition-filled ceremony but Tuesday's \"Sokui no Rei\" is a more elaborate ritual in which he officially announces his change in status to the world. The celebratory mood for what has been proclaimed a national holiday has been tempered by Typhoon Hagibis, which tore through Japan 10 days ago. The typhoon killed at least 80 people and prompted the postponement of a planned celebratory parade. </p><p>Congratulatory banners were flying at some subway stations and street corners, but the public response was a far cry from the celebrations in May when Naruhito's accession coincided with an unusual ten-day holiday period. Small groups of people waited at the Imperial Palace gate on Tuesday in pouring rain, waving Japanese flags and cheering a smiling Naruhito as he entered by car. The first Japanese emperor born after World War II, Naruhito acceded to the throne when his father, Akihito, became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries after worrying that advancing age might make it hard to perform official duties. \"As he is young and energetic with outstanding leadership, I hope he'll support the people of Japan, which has faced continuous disasters and typhoons,\" said Tomoko Shirakawa, 51, who was waiting in front of the palace. Naruhito began the day's ceremonies by reporting his enthronement to his imperial ancestors at one of three shrines on the palace grounds, dressed in a black headdress and pure white robes with a long train borne by an attendant. He was followed later by Empress Masako, dressed in 12-layered white robes and attended by two women in violet robes to arrange her train. TRADITION-BOUND CEREMONY For the main ceremony, Naruhito will wear a traditional burnt-orange robe and headdress, as his father did nearly three decades ago. It will start at 1pm local time (12pm Singapore time) at the Imperial Palace's Matsu no ma, or Hall of Pine, the most prestigious space in the palace. He will declare his enthronement from the \"Takamikura\" - a 6.5m high pavilion that weighs about 8 tonnes - with an ancient sword and a jewel, two of the so-called Three Sacred Treasures, placed beside him. Together with a mirror called Yata-no-Kagami, which is kept at the Ise Grand Shrine, the holiest site in Japan's Shinto religion, the three treasures comprise the regalia that symbolises the legitimacy of the emperor. Masako will also take part in the ceremony, gaining her own throne while wearing 12-layered robes and an elaborate hairstyle. Akihito pledged during his own ceremony in 1990 to observe Japan's pacifist constitution and fulfill his duty as a symbol of the state and for the unity of the people. Naruhito promised to follow his father's path and observers have noted he has so far made only small changes. \"It'll be nice if the new emperor will be as kind hearted as the former emperor and stay close to the people,\" said Ryoya Suzuki, 25, in front of the palace. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to deliver a congratulatory speech before guests including Britain's Prince Charles, who with then-wife Princess Diana attended Akihito's enthronement, as well as U.S. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao. Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi is also expected to take part. A court banquet will be held on Tuesday night, before Naruhito and Masako host a tea party for foreign royalty on Wednesday afternoon. A celebratory parade has been postponed until Nov 10 while the government devotes its attention to coping with the aftermath of the typhoon. Still, NHK national broadcaster said there were 26,000 police providing security on Tuesday. - Reuters/zl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12022576</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB4-CVV1-JCDN-10M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><timeReceived>3:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

A decision on the game in Yokohama will be made on Sunday when officials are able to assess the level of damage from Typhoon Hagibis, which has already forced the cancellation of two games due to be played on Saturday. One of those - New Zealand v Italy - eliminated the Italians and World Rugby are adamant that the rules, which say cancelled pool games cannot be rescheduled, must be applied identically across the board. Should the Yokohama match be cancelled, both Scotland and Japan would receive two points each, meaning Japan and Ireland would finish in the top two in Pool A and reach the quarter-finals, providing the Irish beat the already-eliminated Samoa in their final game. </p><p>World Rugby have said they are looking at alternatives - expected to be playing at a different venue or possibly behind closed doors - but Dodson says that there is also a \"force majeure\" clause that should enable the game to be played on a delayed date. \"My view is that we're not going to let Scotland be the collateral damage for a decision that was taken in haste,\" he told BBC Radio on Friday. \"I think there are alternative (venues) around Japan. If it can't take place on Sunday then we're really, really pressing the point that we need to have to get this game delayed 24 hours.\" Dodson said that he had made little progress despite constant dialogue with tournament organisers, describing the concept of a further cancellation as \"absolutely unacceptable\". He added that the SRU had taken legal opinion that \"unravels the World Rugby case\". Asked if it was too late to mount a legal challenge, he said: \"We don't know that - we have to challenge it. Rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby. \"The common sense approach to this is to play the game 24 hours later in perfect safety, where we can make sure that the pool stages are completed and the sporting integrity of the tournament remains intact.\" Many Scots fear that there is little chance of a change, believing that World Rugby are favouring the home nation as they desperately want a tier two team, and particularly the host nation, in the knockout phase. CROOKED FEED They are also still stinging from the 2015 tournament when they were denied a place in the semi-finals by an incorrect last-minute penalty that handed Australia victory at Twickenham. Last week too there was general incredulity when Samoa were penalised for a crooked scrum feed in the last minute of the match against Japan - the only time a referee has punished the offence in the whole tournament. Japan were allowed to regain possession and went on to score the fourth try they needed for a bonus point that could prove decisive - at Scotland's expense - if Sunday's game goes ahead. And it is not just the Scots who raised an eyebrow at the Pool A schedule, which gives Japan a week between each of their matches while everyone else in the tournament has at least one short turnaround. Meanwhile, fans who bought tickets for the cancelled matches through official channels have already received emails saying refunds will be paid automatically to their account. Tickets bought from \"unauthorised secondary sources\" will not be refunded. In addition to matches being called off, the typhoon's impact on transportation in Japan has also left fans frustrated. Some Australian supporters have had to miss their team's game against Georgia in Shizuoka on Friday because planned train cancellations meant they would not have been able to get back to Tokyo for their flights home.

The three-times champions, who ran in seven tries and had effectively secured victory by halftime, went into the encounter having lost two of their last three matches against the Irish but this superb performance reflected their overall record against the men in green, now standing at 29 wins, two defeats and one draw. After a tight opening 10 minutes the New Zealanders, dominating possession and territory and playing fluent, varied rugby at high pace, took complete control, quicksilver scrumhalf Aaron Smith leading the way with the first two tries. Certainly England will provide a better test for the holders next week in Yokohama, having earlier thrashed Australia 40-16 in the first quarter-final in Oita. </p><p>Holders Japan face South Africa, and Wales meet France in the remaining quarters on Sunday. \"The Irish are a great side, we have come up against them before and they have been on top,\" All Blacks captain Kieran Read said. \"We knew the start was important and we did that well by getting points on board early. \"It was a heck of a test match, really tough out there and we really felt it. It was awesome.\" For Ireland's outgoing skipper Rory Best, the game represented a bitter end to his international career. He was magnanimous in defeat, however. \"The All Blacks were fantastic. We felt we had prepared well and had a game plan,\" he said. \"They just came out of the blocks hard and never let us get off that again. They were just really clinical.\" The All Blacks had not played for almost two weeks since their 71-9 victory over Namibia after their final pool game against Italy was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis. They also had not been challenged since their tournament opener against South Africa four weeks ago and fans were concerned they could be under-prepared for the intensity of a knockout match. BLISTERING PERFORMANCE Steve Hansen's side allayed those fears with a blistering and bruising performance, constantly driving Ireland back at the breakdown and in the tackle and never allowing them to get their close-running game going. They also forced the Irish into numerous handling errors, particularly in contact inside their own half. After scrumhalf Smith scored his first try in the 14th minute following a sustained buildup, the All Blacks seized on two Johnny Sexton errors to put the game beyond doubt. The Irish flyhalf failed to find touch for an attacking lineout, with his opposite number Richie Mo'unga brilliantly keeping the ball in play and the All Blacks then broke into Ireland's half, Smith grabbing his second from close range three minutes later. Sexton then dropped the ball on halfway in a tackle and Mo'unga kicked it ahead with Beauden Barrett winning the race to give the All Blacks a 22-0 halftime lead. \"It wasn't just 22 points, it was all the ball we gave them and missed the penalties which would have given us field advantage,\" said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose six-year tenure with the side ended with the loss. \"It meant we were chasing our tail and they had so much ball in our half in the first half, which was tough going.\" The All Blacks kept their foot on the gas in the second half, pinning Ireland inside their own territory and controlling possession with hooker Codie Taylor, replacement flanker Matt Todd, winger George Bridge and replacement Jordie Barrett also crossing. With just over 10 minutes to go, centre Robbie Henshaw gave Ireland a face-saving try immediately after he had squandered an even better opportunity while referee Nigel Owens also awarded them a penalty try and sinbinned Todd for a professional foul. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12017230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9J-4821-DYWP-R15T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><timeReceived>12:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Dressed in a ceremonial outfit dominated by a draped outer robe in copper, Naruhito announced: \"I hereby declare my enthronement at home and abroad.\" The ceremony was conducted largely in silence, with only drums and gongs sounding. Some 2,000 guests, including foreign dignitaries and royalty, stood at the sound of a deep drum beat before the proclamation began. \"I swear that I will act according to the constitution and fulfil my responsibility as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people,\" the 59-year-old declared, his voice slightly hoarse, in front of guests. \"I sincerely hope that Japan will develop further and contribute to the friendship and peace of the international community, and to the welfare and prosperity of human beings through the people's wisdom and ceaseless efforts.\" When the ceremony was complete, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cried \"Banzai!\" (\"Long live the emperor\") three times. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/ChannelNewsAsia/posts/10156791876842934?__tn__=-R\">https://www.facebook.com/ChannelNewsAsia/posts/10156791876842934?__tn__=-R</url> BANQUETS PLANNED Naruhito officially assumed his duties as emperor on May 1, the day after his father became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries. But the transition was not complete until his new role was officially proclaimed. In the wake of Typhoon Hagibis, the government postponed a royal parade until Nov 10, but the rest of the day's ceremonies were left unchanged. Naruhito began the day by \"reporting\" the proclamation to deities and his ancestors in the ancient royal dynasty, wearing a voluminous white robe and a rarely seen black hat complete with a tail extending up 60cm at the back of his head. And a series of banquets will be held from the evening for guests ranging from Britain's Prince Charles to South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon. The government has also announced more than half a million people convicted of minor offences will be pardoned as part of the events. Small crowds braved the rain to stand outside the palace, hoping for a glimpse of arriving visitors. Sanae Yasuda, in her 70s, had booked a tour from central Japan's Nagoya for the occasion, and decided to come even after the parade was cancelled. \"I didn't know the palace was closed, I wanted to go inside ... I'm still happy to be here,\" she told AFP. SUCCESSION WORRIES \"Today is an important day for the new emperor and the empress,\" added 78-year-old Shuichi Hachinuma, who had come from Sendai city in northeast Japan. \"I feel the emperor is closer to us, compared to in the past ... I want him to send a message of peace.\" \"I wanted to come here just to feel the atmosphere since I know the emperor and the empress are inside,\" said Michiyo Kunikata, 63. \"The couple is really international. I feel a new page has been turned for the royal family,\" she added. Oxford-educated Naruhito faces a delicate balancing act as emperor, seeking to continue his father's legacy of bringing the monarchy closer to the people while upholding the centuries-old traditions of the Chrysanthemum Throne. And the royal line faces its own challenges, with a dearth of successors thanks to rules that prevent women from inheriting the throne. The royal couple have one child, a 17-year-old daughter called Aiko. Naruhito's brother Akishino is currently crown prince. And Akishino's son - 13-year-old Hisahito - is currently the only other remaining successor. There have been calls to revise the succession rules, but so far there have been no formal moves. Despite the succession worries, the royals remain broadly popular. A poll released by national broadcaster NHK on the eve of the ceremony found 70 per cent of voters in the country hold \"friendly or favourable\" views towards the imperial family. - Agencies/zl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12023410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB4-CVV1-JCDN-10KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><timeReceived>4:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

But there's a catch: There are more shovels than hands. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has agreed to use US$6.5 million (5.07 million pounds) for immediate disaster relief, looks set to tap into budget reserves of US$5 billion, and may request more money to finance construction after Typhoon Hagibis tore through much of Japan's main island this month, killing 79 with seven still missing. \"We'll take fiscal steps, including a supplementary budget if necessary, so that disaster-hit local governments can do the utmost on rebuilding,\" Abe said. </p><p>But however much Abe spends, a severe labour shortage means his government will struggle to repair levee breaks and other damage across a broad swath of the country. Construction is one of the most squeezed industries in the nation's tightest job market since the 1970s. As Japan's population greys and shrinks, the supply of construction workers has slumped by 28 per cent from its peak in the late 1990s to around 5 million. Yet demand remains robust amid a nearly seven-year economic expansion and the approach of next year's the Tokyo Olympics. The construction industry has 5.3 job openings for every applicant, latest government data show, a ratio second only to that of security guards and far above the overall ratio of 1.6, which is the highest in decades. LABOUR CRUNCH The scale of Hagibis, in which 71 rivers burst 140 levees and other embankments over vast areas from Nagano, central Japan to Iwate in the far northeast of the main island, means the job of fixing the damage is vast. \"We are absolutely short of workers,\" said Yoshiaki Suzuki, president of the six-man construction firm Suzuki Kenzai Kogyo in Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo, which flooded three times since early September. Tateyama, where Suzuki lives, was still recovering from massive flooding and long power outages caused by Typhoon Faxai last month when Hagibis hit on Oct 12 to Oct 13. On Friday and Saturday, a third storm inundated the city, killing 10 in Chiba Prefecture and dumping as much as 283.5mm (11 inches) of rain on some areas over 12 hours. \"Our top priority is to restore lifelines, repair roads and cover the damaged roofs with blue plastic sheets,\" Suzuki told Reuters. \"There's no time for removing the heaps of rubble caused by the last two typhoons.\" Destabilised soil from earlier storms has led to fresh landslides, making work hazardous for people still digging out, he said. The shortage of construction workers is most pronounced in rural Japan, where the population and construction projects are in steep decline. Highly skilled workers tend to head to bigger cities, said Fumitaka Miura, director at the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, a private think-tank. GOING HIGH-TECH To address the worker shortage, some construction companies are embracing technology. For example, some companies fly drones over construction sites for three-dimensional measuring. The data is fed into machines that design, plan and implement projects, say officials at the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry. These \"i-Construction\" techniques can cut working hours by 30 per cent, they say. Technological solutions like these are deployed in 60 per cent of large-scale construction projects, the officials say. But most of the disaster recovery will be done with bricks, mortar, equipment and manual labour. Speculation is mounting that Abe may ask for more funds in an extra budget at the end of the year, as the longest postwar economic boom sputters amid global trade wars and the government watches the impact of a sales tax increase this month. Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, says the government is likely to earmark US$5 billion-US$10 billion for infrastructure rebuilding, while longtime Japan strategist Jesper Koll forecasts something more like US$20 billion to US$30 billion, given the \"need for fast and decisive government action.\" - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12040538</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCD-6YT1-DYWP-R148-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><timeReceived>5:56 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Devan, Irfan Bakti and Zainal Abidin Hassan who were in Japan for two weeks to attend an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) coaching course.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following the completion of their course, the coaches stayed at a hotel in Niigata, Japan, on Saturday before boarding their return flight to Kuala Lumpur yesterday.</p><p>On Saturday, Typhoon Hagibis, the strongest storm to hit Japan in six decades, slammed into the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main island of Honshu, triggering landslides and flooding.</p><p>Sulaiman described the experience of staying in his hotel room, when the storm hit Niigata, as frightening.</p><p>Amid the terrifying typhoon, the 42-year-old Sulaiman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind was not only on his safety but also on the return leg (Saturday) of the Challenge Cup final between his team and Johor Darul Ta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122zim II (JDT II) at KLFA Stadium in Cheras.</p><p>Although UKM managed to overturn the first leg deficit for a 1-1 aggregate draw, JDT II won 6-5 on penalties for the Challenge Cup crown.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feared for my life. Everyone was scared, but we kept calm and were instructed to remain indoors as the hotel locked all exit points. The typhoon hit Niigata between 4pm and midnight... it was really scary,\u00e2\u20ac said Sulaiman when contacted via WhatsApp in Niigata yesterday.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was my first close encounter with a typhoon, and I hope I would never experience it again. Everyone is okay but of course, we are still feeling the effects of the typhoon.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>Asked whether he watched the Challenge Cup final on the Internet, Sulaiman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, luckily, the Internet was fine.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I watched the match on my laptop with Dollah, Zainal and Irfan in my room. However, we were also thinking about our safety as the match started.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I communicated with my assistant coaches (Juzaili Samion, Rezal Zambery Yahya and Yusrizal Yusoff) at half-time and spoke about strategies.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The changes did work as UKM scored a goal to take the tie into extra-time,\u00e2\u20ac said Sulaiman, who played as a midfielder for Kuala Lumpur between 1993-98.</p><p>On UKM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss to JDT II in the Challenge Cup final, Sulaiman said he was nevertheless proud of his team.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a slow start to our Premier League season as I was trying out new tactics. However, we picked up after 14 matches into the league and it worked.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The team earned crucial wins and avoided being relegated. Overall, I am happy that we managed to finish runners-up in the Challenge Cup although we came close to winning it.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are a small club and some of our core players are undergraduates, so reaching this far in the tournament for a second straight season is a great effort.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>Among the players who are UKM undergraduates and former students are captain Asnan Ahmad, Wan Afiq Wan Kasbi, Saiful Hasnol, Aliff Jamaluddin, Abdul Gafur Samsudin, Izzat Ikmal Azpawi, Zarul Aidiel Aziz, Hafiz Zalani, Fitri Zaim, Faiz Hanif Adnan, Azri Zulkiflee, Arip Amiruddin, Akmal Zahir and Wan Faiz Wan Sulaiman</p><p>Sulaiman brushed off talk that UKM are withdrawing from the M-League next season.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153UKM will definitely play next season. Our management will work hard to look for sponsors. The players are eager to don UKM colours again next season.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153My contract ends next month. I have received a few offers, but my heart says that I should continue working with UKM.</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It all depends on whether the management still need my services. I also have to see what are UKM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for the new season,\u00e2\u20ac Sulaiman added.</p><p>( END )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NSTRTT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NSTRTT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8C-Y6X1-JC85-C014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Straits Times (Malaysia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Main Section</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A3NR</classCode><className>SOCCER TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001587</classCode><className>SOCCER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001003</classCode><className>LANDSLIDES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N813990GM</classCode><className>SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX201</classCode><className>KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DAVX</classCode><className>CHUBU JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC308</classCode><className>MALAYSIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Finn crossed the line 11.3 seconds ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who made a hesitant start from pole position and had to fend off a charging Lewis Hamilton in the closing laps. The result moved Mercedes 177 points clear of Ferrari, allowing them to wrap up a record-equalling sixth consecutive constructors' crown, with a maximum 176 points from four races still to be won. It also assured Mercedes of the drivers' title with only Bottas now capable of challenging five-times world champion Hamilton, whose lead narrowed to 64 points. </p><p>Mercedes have now equalled Ferrari's record six constructors' titles in a row between 1999-2004. The Italian team won five successive drivers' crowns with Michael Schumacher from 2000-04. \"Starting third is never easy here but there's no point giving up,\" said Bottas after his third win of the season and first since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April. \"I had a really nice car and Sebastian had an issue, so it was good to get the lead. Really proud of the team, a sixth title in a row is so impressive.\" Ferrari looked like they might delay the title celebrations after locking out the front row in a qualifying session held on Sunday morning, after being postponed from its traditional Saturday slot due to Typhoon Hagibis. But both Vettel and team mate Charles Leclerc ran into trouble at the start. Vettel launched off his grid spot a fraction too soon and slammed on the brakes before moving again. He was investigated for a false start but let off without a sanction because his car had not crossed the line. The momentary hesitation was enough to allow Bottas to sweep around the outside and into the lead. Leclerc collided with Max Verstappen as the Dutchman tried to pass around the outside, damaging the Ferrari and pushing the Red Bull, which later retired, into a spin. The Monegasque nevertheless carried on, crucially holding up Hamilton as his car shed bodywork in a shower of debris before eventually pitting for repairs at the end of the third lap. PENALTIES Leclerc, 21 and winner of two of the last five races, crossed the line sixth but dropped to seventh behind Renault's Daniel Ricciardo after being slapped with two post-race time penalties. He collected a five-second penalty for the Verstappen incident and a further 10 seconds for continuing to drive a car deemed to be in an unsafe condition. Ferrari were also fined 25,000 euros (US$27,600) for the latter offence while Leclerc was given two penalty points on his superlicence. Ricciardo and 10th-placed team mate Nico Hulkenberg could still drop back, however, with Racing Point lodging a protest against the French manufacturer for an alleged brake bias infringement. \"The lights were on but it was my mistake (at the start),\" said Vettel, a four-time winner at Suzuka. \"The Mercedes were difficult, they had more pace than us and Valtteri was flying. I'm not happy with the start of the race but everything else was fine, just lacked a bit of pace.\" Hamilton's joy at Mercedes's success was muted after the team gambled on a one-stop strategy for the Briton, even as Bottas and Vettel opted for two. With tyre degradation higher than expected, the 34-year-old was forced to pit a second time and lost track position to Vettel. \"Firstly, congratulations to the team,\" said Hamilton, who can still clinch the drivers' title at the next race in Mexico. \"That's the main point. I just wanted to bring home good points for the team.\" LAP EARLY The race officially ran for only 52 of 53 scheduled laps after the chequered flag was shown a lap early on the digital displays around the track. Drivers, who did not see the chequered flag display on their steering wheel dashboards, continued to race around but the order at the end of the 52nd lap was declared as the result. As a result, Mexican Sergio Perez retained his ninth place finish for Racing Point, despite crashing out after contact with Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly at the start of the final lap.

Wing Kenki Fukuoka led the way with two tries, while Kotaro Matsushima and Keita Inagaki also scored as the hosts held off a fierce second-half assault from a team they had lost against in all seven of their previous meetings. When Japan beat South Africa four years ago - having won only one of their previous 24 World Cup matches - it was considered the greatest shock in rugby history. This time, having already beaten Ireland three weeks ago, it did not even feel like a real surprise. </p><p>They were faster, sharper, more inventive and, roared on by the vast majority of the delirious red-and-white-clad crowd, absolutely relentless in everything they did as they became the first tier-two team to reach the last eight since Fiji in 2007. Having won all four of their matches to top Pool A with 19 points, they will face the Springboks again in the quarter-finals and the twice-champions will be taking absolutely nothing for granted. The result also meant that Ireland, through as runners-up on 16 points, will play New Zealand. \"Tonight we went another level,\" said Japan coach Jamie Joseph. \"They wanted it as much as the Scots and gave as much as they could. This is what it takes to win big test matches.\" The match was given the go-ahead only on Sunday morning after an inspection of the damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis and proved a wonderfully uplifting occasion for the country after the death and destruction wrought by the storm. \"Whilst we are celebrating tonight there are a lot of people who aren't,\" Joseph said. Captain Michael Leitch said that the victory owed more to heart than skill and while that might be true of their mighty defensive effort in the final quarter, no team in the tournament so far has come close to matching the pace and directness of Japan's first-half assault. EXPLOSION OF NOISE Scotland were first on the board with a Finn Russell try after seven minutes but Japan hit back with a brilliantly-worked, high-tempo score that set the tone for the night as Fukuoka tore clear and slung a one-armed pass into the arms of the supporting Matsushima to detonate an explosion of noise. If that was good, their next score was a contender for try of the tournament. Fukuoka and Matsushima again put on the afterburners and then a mesmerizing series of off-loads and side-steps ended with Shota Horie presenting supporting prop Inagaki with an unmissable opportunity. Japan were playing with a speed and intensity that the Scots just could not live with and got a third try at the end of the half when Tim Lafaele slipped through a deft grubber that bounced perfectly into the arms of Fukuoka. It was then bedlam two minutes into the second half when Fukuoka stripped Chris Harris and galloped clear for a fourth and bonus-point clinching try. The Scots, who came from 31-0 down to draw 38-38 with England in the Six Nations in March, channelled that Twickenham spirit as WP Nel and Zander Fagerson scored to get back within seven points with 25 minutes to go but with the bonus-point situation, they still needed more than two converted tries to advance. It was relentless Scottish pressure and desperate, at times demented, Japanese defending from then on, but the hosts held out for another famous victory in what became a deafening cauldron of noise. It was only the second time Scotland have failed to reach the last eight - the other coming in 2011 - but they can have few complaints, bookending wins over Russia and Samoa with defeats by Ireland and the hosts. \"We had a mountain to climb after that first half but we started climbing it and I thought the effort the players put in to get back to within seven points was excellent,\" said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend. \"We were obviously aware that this was huge for the home nation. The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic and you didn't want to be the team that was losing in that atmosphere.\" (Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Toby Davis) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11996474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-9531-DYWP-R1Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><timeReceived>1:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

READ: South Africans to put economic woes aside and honour Springboks The first Rugby World Cup to be held in the world's biggest continent was a roaring success on and off the field. At the tournament's closing press conference in Tokyo, World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said: Japan 2019 will be remembered as probably the greatest Rugby World Cup. \"It has certainly been the most ground-breaking in terms of bringing the game to new audiences and attracting new fans to the sport.\" </p><p>Officials were delighted with stadiums that were 99 per cent full, the 1.2 million people at specially designated fan zones to watch the games on big screens, and 500,000 visitors from around the world. READ: Fans mingle, tension mounts ahead of World Cup final READ: 'Plan for everything': Rugby World Cup's advice to Tokyo Olympics An incredible 54 million people tuned into Japanese television - a record for any rugby game - to watch the national team, nicknamed the Brave Blossoms, defeat Scotland to progress to the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time in nine attempts. UNITING A NATION The performance and tournament as a whole gave a nation still recovering from Typhoon Hagibis, which killed over 80 people and left thousands homeless in October, something to get behind. It was reminiscent of that stunning win by the Japanese women's football team of the 2011 World Cup just four months after the country had suffered a devastating earthquake and tsunami. Eight years on from that terrible day when the city of Kamaishi saw 1,300 of its residents killed, the city hosted two World Cup games at the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium, which sits on the site of a school washed away in 2011. Such is the power of sport. This World Cup also showed that there is a new power in the world of rugby. The game has been slow to move from its heartlands of the United Kingdom, France, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand but Japan has been a breath of fresh air. \"One of the reasons we came to Asia was to actually leave a legacy,\" Mr Beaumont added. \"What we have to do is carry on working with them so when you come back in two years' time, the people are talking about (Brave) Blossoms and not about baseball.\" That is still a worry. After years of defeat at the World Cup, Japan shocked the world by defeating South Africa at the 2015 World Cup in England and winning three games in total. This awakened interest in the country but the excitement quickly faded away. Four years on, the World Cup has ignited a rugby fever in Japan much more widespread and intense than before. Its rugby bosses are determined not to miss the opportunity this time round. A NEW RUGBY COMPETITION IN JAPANJapanese officials are looking to revamp the structure of the domestic league to make it stronger on and off the field. In October, Katsuyuki Kiyomiya, the vice president of the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU), told reporters that he will hold a news conference in November to announce plans to launch a new domestic competition expected to start in 2021. \"This World Cup is a big event Japanese rugby has not experienced before and we are tested on how we take the excitement and enthusiasm created by this event to the next level,\" Mr Kiyomiya said. Details will follow but reports suggest there will be a new, professional 12-team league run. It will give the current Top League, a low-key affair with teams owned by corporations such as Panasonic, Toshiba and Toyota almost as a public service, a run for their money. This new league will likely run on a separate calendar to Super Rugby (the southern hemisphere competition that features clubs from South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) and would aim to attract top players from that tournament. With interest in Japan at an all-time high, Mr Kiyomiya said that the league looks to generate an annual revenue of 50 billion yen (US$460 million) through sponsorship and the sale of media rights. If so, clubs would not only be able to attract talent from the traditional rugby powerhouse nations but would also be able to offer the best players in Asia the chance to pursue a lucrative career in the sport. HELPING ASIA It will help Asia's rugby aspirations for Japan to continue its ascendance. The success of Japan could serve as an example and an inspiration to its neighbours. Japan is the only Asian nation to ever appear at the World Cup. It is head and shoulders ahead of the next best teams including Hong Kong, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia. READ: Memorable moments from Japan's World Cup If World Rugby can increase representation at the World Cup for Asia, there will be more interest and investment in the sport from Asian nations, past the amateur and semi-professional level. Japan will benefit from sharpening its craft, if Asia has its own competitive rugby games. Therefore, it is also in Japan's interest that Asia improves at the game. For now, no doubt Japan's journey serves as an inspiration, but that journey is going to be long. The Brave Blossoms won just one game in its first seven World Cups from 1987 to 2011, suffering some demoralising thrashings along the way. That feels a long time ago now. If the passion that has been on display in recent weeks can be harnessed, Japan can become a force to be reckoned with - wherever the World Cup takes place.
