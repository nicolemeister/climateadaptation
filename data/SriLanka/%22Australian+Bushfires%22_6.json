They have been raging in years before, but the fires of 2019 have devastated not only humans but also the fauna and flora of that land. Not much is mentioned about what it has done for the animal kingdom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For 1000's of years indigenous Australians have used fire to foster grasslands for hunting and to clear tracks through dense vegetation. Thus manmade 'bushfires' in the Outback have been a common occurrence.</p><p>In recent times as early as 1967 we learned about the Tasmanian natural bushfire disaster which occurred on 7 February 1967, known in Australia as Black Tuesday which killed 62 people and 900 injured and nearly 7000 homeless.</p><p>In 2003 the Canberra bushfire caused severe damage to the suburbs of the National Capital. This took place around 18-22 January 2003. Almost 70% of the area's pastures, pine plantations and natural parks were severely damaged. MountStromio Observatory was completely destroyed, with 4 people dead, 490 injured and 470 homes destroyed or severely damaged requiring repairs and reconstruction.</p><p>On 7 February 2009 some ten years before the recent bushfire in September 2019 a further bushfire occurred in the State of Victoria and some 173 people died.</p><p>Now in 2019, we are told already 5,900,000 hectares of land is destroyed, over 2500</p><p>Buildings and at least 18 people have lost their lives including some volunteer firefighters.</p><p>What are some of the effects of the Australian bushfires?</p><p>Bushfires have an intensive effect and impact extensive areas and cause property damage and loss of human life. But no one talks of the extensive damage, which as many will agree, is caused to the animal and birdlife, which is difficult to quantify.</p><p>We are reliably informed that half a billion animals are feared dead in these bushfires and it is estimated at least 8,000 koala bears have already been wiped out.</p><p>Many will also agree that the firefighters cannot search for animal life including search and rescue koalas, kangaroos, camels and other animals, not to mention the varied species of birdlife.</p><p>According to researchers at the University of Sydney, some 480 million mammals, birds, reptiles are estimated to have perished since the fires started in New South Wales, Australia in September 2019. We are further informed that some 8000 koala bears alone are thought to have been killed, a third of the entire koala population of the region.</p><p>What are some of the effects of the bushfires in far away South America?</p><p>Yes, we all agree that bushfires in Australia are a regular feature of life in Australia.</p><p>But the recent blaze in the two states of Australia, New South Wales and Queensland and perhaps even in the state of Victoria, have not previously occurred on such a scale.</p><p>The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) offices in Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom, has been able to monitor the bushfires in Australia since September 2019 and states that smoke particles from these bushfires have reached South America as satellite imagery shows atmospheric pollution created by the fires across New South Wales has travelled more than 10,000 kilometres to Chile and Argentina. How knows whether they will make a claim for air pollution to a Climate Court in the years to come?</p><p>Reading between the lines, we see messages on Twitter stating what it really is like in New South Wales: 'the sky was just black, the Sun was red, and we saw men beating back the flames\u2026\u2026\u2026'.</p><p>Clamour for Climate Change</p><p>From tomorrow 3 January 2020, two Australian States of New South Wales and Queensland have declared the State of Emergency as the bushfires are a serious threat to heavily populated areas in their states.</p><p>The Volunteer Firefighters who up to now have been a volunteer force will from now on be paid for their firefighting work.</p><p>The Security Services, the Australian Army and Navy have also been recruited to help in the operation.</p><p>Citizens of towns and cities in the devastated areas are fleeing to the beaches in search of refugee.</p><p>This has led many around the world to seek answers whether the bushfires in Australia can be linked to Climate Change?</p><p>As many know or may know, the science around Climate Change is complex. It is not the cause of bushfires, according to some scientists.</p><p>But what we know for sure is that the average temperature in Australia now is running about 1 degree centigrade above the longterm average. Seasons are starting earlier according to Richard Thornton, Chief, Bushfires and National Hazards Cooperative Research Centre in Australia. Is it any wonder for us who are ordinary citizens?</p><p>Australia's Climate Change commitment under the Paris Agreement - the global deal to tackle rising global temperature is a 26-28% per capita reduction in emissions by 2030 and a 64-65% reduction in the emissions intensity of the economy between 2005 and 2030.</p><p>Will it be practical to scale this reduction in the years ahead?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLGUAR-SRILAGUARD0301202000004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLGUAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P9-1Y41-JCH9-G0TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Sri Lanka Guardian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sri Lanka Guardian</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18517\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

Shocking images of this devastation are reverberating around the world, which has already killed at least 18 people, destroyed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of homes in regional areas of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and burnt more than 5 million hectares. Another distressing news, was that scientists believe almost half a billion mammals, birds and reptiles have also been killed during the last four months across Australia. In New South Wales a third of the state's koala colony - around 8,000 bears - are thought to have been wiped out by the fires. Many Australians dropped their ordinary lives to battle the nation's raging fire crisis, as part of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS).</p><p>The devastation of the Australian bushfires has generated an outpouring of generosity amongst Australians.</p><p>'Supporting the immediate response and rebuilding efforts is vital, but it's also important to consider how as a nation we collectively address the factors which are increasing bushfire risk. Climate change is increasing the risk that we will see more frequent and intense bushfires' states Krystian Seibert, Industry Fellow, Centre for Social Impact, Swinburne University of Technology.</p><p>Swinburne University of Technology</p><p>With a rich history of over 100 years, Swinburne University continues to be a leader in the fields of science, technology and innovation, producing cutting edge research and outstanding industry oriented graduates each year. Students who join NCHS will be enrolled at Swinburne, and are privy to choose from a wide selection of degree programs.</p><p>Globally competitive qualifications</p><p>Swinburne University has been named amongst the top research-intensive universities in the world according to a number of prestigious world academic ranking lists. Swinburne is ranked among the world's top 3% universities in the prestigious Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU). It has also been highly rated by the Good Universities Guide, in the educational experience category, including for teaching quality and generic (employability) skills.</p><p>The continuous high ranks achieved by the university is a commitment to the quality of education and the research mandate achieved. As a part of the partnerships with NCHS, it is ensured that Swinburne will monitor the education standard at NCHS, ensuring that the same standards are maintained. This ensures that Si Lankan students have the best of the Swinburne experience from inception of the pathway or degree program while at NCHS.</p><p>Nawaloka College</p><p>The Nawaloka College consists of world class facilities including a modern engineering laboratory, a well-equipped computer lab and a resourceful library. The institute operates under the vision to excel in the higher education field of the country, shaping today's young minds into tomorrow's leaders.</p><p>A well experienced Swinburne faculty will lead Nawaloka College academics ensuring that students are exposed to an international learning experience. Academic programs will follow the same syllabuses, method of delivery and evaluation methods as the Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia and Cal State.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM1901202000151</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1R-48S1-JCH9-G20C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"560\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Certificates, Degrees &amp;

It was the highest trending song of the week but came very short of the dominating home grown hit 'Own It 'by Stormzy and others. While the melody seemed radio friendly, the lyrics nevertheless of 'Yummy' came in for some flack. The song is the lead single from what will be Bieber's forthcoming fifth album due shortly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aretha Franklin biopic in October</p><p>The biopic on Aretha Franklin is moving ahead as it targets a October release. However the late singer's son Kecalf Franklin has attacked the movie's producers on social media for failing to consult the family about the production. Countering, other members of Aretha's family did not subscribe to the criticism. Jennifer Hudson was handpicked by Aretha Franklin to portray her before she died in 2018.</p><p>Amy Winehouse exhibition opens at Grammy Museum</p><p>An exhibition dedicated to Amy Winehouse opened at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles on 17th January.

Amy died in 2012 at the age of 27.</p><p>Musicians pledge support towards Bushfire relief</p><p>As Australian bushfires continue several musicians from many parts have stepped forward to pledge support towards the relief effort now in full swing. Sir Elton John pledged A$1 million during his Sydney concert on 7th January. Kylie Minogue and her sister Dannii and family donated $500,000. The heavy metal rock band Metallica, has donated $750,000 while Pink has pledged $500,000. The artist Lizzo who was touring the country has also pledged an unspecified figure while also turning out at food bank in Melbourne on 8th January to volunteer. The singer Shawn Mendes is said to be working through his foundation and the Australian Red Cross. Meanwhile Brian May has suggested staging a concert at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney on 16th February where he has said Queen + Adam Lambert is prepared to perform for a Fire Fighters Benefit concert.</p><p>Rascal Flatts to split up</p><p>The Country music band Rascal Flatts who had a huge universal hit with the song 'Life Is A Highway' from 2006 are to split up. The group will undertake a tour ironically called Farewell: Life IS Highway, starting on 7th June and end in October in Florida. The trio are bowing out after selling over 20 million albums and being together for 20 years.</p><p>UK artist Stormzy's hit 'Own It' extends stay at the top of the singles</p><p>It was a busy week for UK artist Stormzy as he crisscrossed the country signing copies of his new album and then at the end of it all scored a double No: 1 on both the singles and albums chart. His song 'Own It' extended its stay at the top of the singles chart for a second week while his new album 'Heavy Is The Head' moved up from 2 to No:1 on the UK albums chart. Stormzy has written 'Own It' under his own name Michael Omani, Ed Sheeran, Fed Gibson (who is also co producer) and Damini Ogulu - the actual name of Burna Boy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM1901202000126</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1R-48S1-JCH9-G1YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000672</classCode><className>EXHIBITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp;

In its 17th year, CFW is taking a stand against the harmful practices of fast fashion and aims to steer the industry in Sri Lanka towards being more responsible, accountable and transparent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CFW announced their brand new impact-based 'Responsibility in Fashion' programme - the driving force of this year's Fashion Week, which will take place from March 18 to 21 this year, at a press conference earlier this week.</p><p>The message of sustainable change and environmentally conscious initiatives was the key focus for both CFW, its designers and its partners. As Founder and Managing Director of CFW Ajai Vir Singh points out, the garment industry is the second more polluting industry in the world. Due to hyper-fashion and hyper-consumption, clothes are hitting landfills at an alarming rate. In 2020, major fashion weeks around the world came under fire for their wasteful practices following the Australian bushfires and other climate change disasters.</p><p>'We were on a journey for the last five years developing ourselves as a sustainable industry, and found ourselves quite ready to come out with a product that answered a lot of questions that the global industry was looking for,' says Ajai.</p><p>The 'Responsibility in Fashion' programme is part of the Responsible Fashion Movement, and is based on circularity that ensures longevity of each garment. These actionable impacts are threefold, with the Garment Enhancement Guarantee, Garment Disposal Plan and Return-After-Use for Repurpose. CFW also introduces The Responsible Meter, a first-of-its-kind garment evaluation tool that awards each garment presented this season a score out of ten based on environmental, societal and organisational wellbeing.</p><p>The participating designers are all on board with this programme, making CFW the first Fashion Week in the world to practise responsible fashion collectively.</p><p>This edition of CFW will see nearly 30 designers showcasing their latest collections over a period of four days. Sri Lankan designers Charini Suriyage, Dimuthu Sahabandu, Indeevari Yapa Abeywardena, Sharmila Ruberu, Asanka De Mel, Dinushi Pamunuwa, Fouzul Hameed, Amilani Perera, Aslam Hussein, Kamil Hewavitharana and Jai by Aashki will also be joined by international designers Kanika Goyal and Siddartha Tytler.</p><p>Additionally, a special show titled 'RE' was announced, where participating designers will showcase the responsible impacts in their collections while celebrating sustainable design in both fashion and architecture.</p><p>CFW also continues its journey in developing the next generation of fashion designers in Sri Lanka with the Emerging Designer Programme. This year they have received the highest number of applications yet, making this edition of the Emerging Designer showcase the biggest to date, with 13 young designers chosen to present their collections on the runway. The emerging designers will also incorporate the Responsible Meter and three actionable impacts into their collection as part of the programme.</p><p>Joining CFW on their journey towards responsibility are their partners, starting with Title Partner of CFW Summer edition for 13 years HSBC. 'We are spearheading a project with the IUCN and JAAF in Sri Lanka, looking at how small and medium-sized apparel manufacturers can become greener and more sustainable, and reduce their carbon footprint.' says CEO for HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives Mark Prothero. Official Host Hotel for the last 11 years Hilton Colombo are also supporting the fashion industry by partnering with a recycling plant to convert used plastic to yarn for a local clothing brand.</p><p>Also joining CFW 2020 is TRESemm\u00e9 as Official Hair Care Partner,Ramani Fernando as Official Hair and Make-up Partner, Shangri-La Hotel Colombo as Official Hospitality Partner, Vision Care as Official Eyewear Partner, Vogue Jewellers as Official Jewellery Partner, High Commission of India as a strategic partner presenting Indian designers, JaguarLand Rover as Official Automobile Partner;

In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the 93-year-old Sir David made the direct link between the ongoing bushfires and climate change. \"As I speak, south-east Australia is on fire. Why? Because the temperatures of the Earth are increasing,\" he said. \"We have been putting things off year after year. We've been raising targets, saying 'oh well, if we do it in the next 20 years ...' the moment of crisis has come.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than 10.7m hectares of land has burnt so far in the Australian bushfires, including 80% of the Blue Mountains, and 50% of the Gondwana world heritage rainforests.</p><p>While Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has talked down suggestions, there are climate change deniers in his party, several Australian government MPs have continued to downplay the role of global heating on the bushfire crisis and Mr Morrison has attempted to pivot the debate from acting on climate change to resilience and adaptation, the Guardian quoted the BBC as saying.</p><p>Sir David said the world could no longer prevaricate and delay decisions, and the change needed to be made not by appealing to optimism but by highlighting it is a life or death decision.\"This is not just having nice little debates and arguments and then coming away with a compromise. This is an urgent problem that has to be solved,\" he said.</p><p>\"And what is more is that we know how to do it, that's the paradoxical thing, that we are refusing to take steps that we know have to be taken. \"And every year that passes makes those steps more and more difficult to achieve.\"</p><p>He said China needed to step forward and announce it would curb carbon output because of climate change, and everyone else would \"fall into line\".\"That would be the big change that one could hope would happen.\"He said the public mood had already shifted.\"People can see the problem, particularly young people can see the problem, and that must force</p><p>governments to take action.\"</p><p>In Sri Lanka also we are experiencing the drastic effects of climate change, with prolonged droughts, and unusually heavy rains with floods, at times we do not expect. Most climate change analysts believe we are still depending far too much on fossil fuels or coal power and the new government needs to give top priority to clean energy initiatives including solar power and wind power. As we prepare to celebrate Independence Day on February 4 we need to remember that freedom is linked to responsibility. To the extent we carry out our responsibilities as good citizens, to that extent only, do we have a moral right to claim rights and freedom. To the extent, we fail in our responsibilities and live in a selfish or self-centred way to that extent we forfeit our rights and freedom. While the government and big organisations handle mega projects we also make our little contributions by saving water and electricity, using public transport whenever possible and even going back to the bicycles because it will not cause any pollution but in a positive way will provide good exercise. With non-communicable diseases like diabetes reaching alarming rates in Sri Lanka nutritionists say a balanced diet and lifestyle including exercise are effective ways to curb this trend.</p><p>Almost a half-century ago the then Finance Minister Dr. N. M. Perera, saying he saw the \"dim light of the distant dawn\" advised people to cultivate home gardens so that the food we eat could be to a larger extent non-polluted. But his plea fell into the category of wisdom that is gone with the wind. Today we are eating either imported food part of which is processed rubbish while even local food is polluted by unscrupulous traders who use dangerous substances as preservatives.</p><p>We hope that as we celebrate Independence Day most of us will take the responsibility of playing a role in the battle against climate change and the related issue such as poverty alleviation, and a peaceful resolution of conflicts, in addition, we need to encourage talented young people to use their creative and imaginative skills to tackle issues like climate change because it is the young people who will suffer most if global warming is not checked.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

This Pongal is celebrated on the first day of the month Thai (Pronounced as in 'why') in the Tamil Calendar.</p><p>Pongal is a series of Tamil/Hindu harvest festivals of the South Indian region, particularly in the Tamil community. It is observed at the start of the month Thai according to Tamil solar calendar, and this is typically about January 14 or 15. This year it ends on January 18.</p><p>The wonder is that the sun starts its northward journey today after touching the southernmost point in its southward movement. (Look up suncalc.org) The time is also right to realise unimportance that the humans are just a speck in the cosmic expanse what we understand by common agreement as 'nature'.</p><p>Pongal or Thai Pongal is NOT just a Thanksgiving festival that is unique only to Tamils. It just happens that it is just one of the many hundreds of such festivals throughout the year by numerous cultures AROUND the globe. The Tamil Pongal just happens to be the South Indian or Tamil version.</p><p>The celebration of the festival of Pongal dates back to 2,000 years, as early as the early Chola empire. Celebrated on the third day of the Thai month, it is important to most Hindu families in Tamil Nadu as they pray to Sun God Surya and Lord Indra.</p><p>Tracing the tradition in history, Surya (Sun) is glorified in the Vedas as an all-seeing god who observes both good and evil actions of humans. He was believed to expel not only darkness but also evil dreams and diseases.</p><p>\"Sun heroes and sun kings also occupy a central position in Indian mythology, where Vivasvant, the father of Yama, corresponds to the Iranian Vivahvant, the father of Yima. There is a dynasty of sun kings, characteristically peaceful, that is quite distinct from the warlike moon kings,\" an encyclopaedic entry says.</p><p>\"In the medieval Iran, sun festivals were celebrated as a heritage from pre-Islamic times. The Indo-European character of sun worship is also seen in the conception of the solar deity, drawn in his carriage, generally by four white horses, common to many Indo-European peoples, and recurring in Indo-Iranian, Greco-Roman, and Scandinavian mythology,\"</p><p>Sun heroes and sun kings also occupy a central position in Indian mythology, where Vivasvant, the father of Yama, corresponds to the Iranian Vivahvant, the father of Yima</p><p>According to the Puranic literature, Surya Vamsam or the Solar Dynasty or the Ikshvaku Dynasty is an ancient and one of the oldest dynasties of India. The Sun God Surya, also known as Vivasvan is considered the primogenitor of Surya Vamsam and his son Vaivasvata Manu is the progenitor of humanity according to the Hindu texts. Hence Manu Dharma.</p><p>Lord Rama and Prince Siddhartha Gautama (The Buddha) also belong to the Surya Vamsam a or the Ikshvaku Dynasty.</p><p>Lineage issues apart, what is important is the natural human interference things.</p><p>The Western ignorance of living in harmony with nature starts circa 6 AD and lasted till the Renaissance and later. However, things are changing now. The thought emanates from the human-centric idea -that everything around the man is for him and his survival, instead of the fact that man himself is an inextricable part of the tightly knit ecosystem.</p><p>Sometime back a video was circulating in the social media voiced over by Julia Roberts. That video sent a strong message, which unfortunately drowned in the din of worldly events. The video is about the importance of 'Mother' Nature. What strikes the message home was its strong ending:</p><p>\"Nature doesn't need people; People needs nature\" and \"I do not need you but you depend on me\" That is what is important for us to inculcate in the younger generation. To live in harmony with nature.</p><p>That the fact the earth existed-according to high priests of science-4.5 billion years ago; and it will be for billions of years to come. The average life expectancy of a human being is just 79 years as at today. 79 years upon 4,500,000,000. The Sun also has about 5 billion years more. So is earth if the estimate is correct.</p><p>However these days routinely I see the empirical science closing in, on the traditional pastoral and tribal wisdom, who lived and live in harmony with nature and thrive. There is no hope for humans; Either adapt to natures ways; Or perish.</p><p>But the sad reality is that we have come a long way straying away from those ideals. And the maximum a person can do is to minimise the damage he/she causes to Nature.</p><p>Having said that this Thai Pongal day let us remember that Pongal is not just worshipping the sun, but respecting Nature and thanking it as fellow sentient beings.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.
