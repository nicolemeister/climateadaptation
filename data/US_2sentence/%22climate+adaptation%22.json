Political science has long studied the politics of carbon dioxide mitigation, but we know less about the political logic of climate impacts.<br/> \u201cAs adaptation lies at the intersection of environmental, social, and disaster policy, its electoral effects are puzzling from a theoretical perspective. We address this gap by studying a program to improve the ability of households to withstand episodes of water scarcity in Mexico City, implemented between presidential cycles.<br/> \u201cIn contrast to conventional forms of social policy, this intervention prioritizes building future resilience instead of immediate material benefits. We take advantage of the means-tested nature of the program to reduce imbalances between treated and control neighbors and estimate a difference-in-differences to evaluate its impact on electoral outcomes. We find that neighborhoods receiving this adaptation policy had, on average, higher levels of support for the party in charge of its implementation at the presidential and gubernatorial levels, compared to similar neighborhoods that did not receive the program. We also posit that reductions in reliance on inadequate water sources are a mechanism that explains this result.<br/> \u201cOur findings suggest that climate adaptation may be less contentious than mitigation, therefore giving politicians strong incentives to implement them.

Fuelled by prolonged drought, an intense heatwave, and strong winds, the blaze scorched 104 square kilometres of land, according to Eratosthenes Centre of Excellence, Cyprus University of Technology, while the government says 124 square kilometres. It claimed two lives, caused significant animal losses, and inflicted partial or total destruction on homes, businesses, crops, critical infrastructure, forest and an entire natural system that sustained diverse forms of life. The immediate reaction is over and the tragedy has already been sidelined by seemingly more pressing concerns, such as reacting to Fidias\u2019 videos. </p><p>And while countless questions have arisen in all this, the real enduring question is: what happens next, and how do we do it? A costly and immeasurable toll The full toll of this disaster on both the environment and human population is immeasurable. Beyond the visible devastation for nature, homeowners, local business owners, and farmers who have seen their livelihoods damaged or destroyed, scientists warn of cascading effects, beginning with the imminent threat of post-fire flash floods. These floods pose a direct danger to lower-lying communities and will very likely contaminate water resources by washing debris and sediment laden with toxic heavy metals from ash into waterways and essential reservoirs, such as Kouris dam. Moreover, for surviving wildlife, the loss of food and habitat will cause imbalances and increase susceptibility to disease and pests. Meanwhile, hazardous air quality during and after the crisis, as well as exposure to dangerous materials during cleanup efforts, pose substantial health risks to residents and responders alike. It\u2019s also crucial to understand the vicious cycle, known as a climate feedback loop. This occurs when the immense carbon released by wildfires creates warmer, drier conditions, which in turn create the conditions for even more frequent and severe infernos in the future. Essentially, fires such as this one worsen the climate and create a self-perpetuating cycle of destruction. Urgent priorities Right now, clearly the utmost priority is to support those affected by every possible means and to set urgent priorities for environmental management. Implementing anti-erosion and flood-prevention works before the next rainfalls is critical to mitigate secondary disasters like flash floods. Additionally, a public-private sector programme for soil rehabilitation, assisted natural regeneration and recovery in general will need to be drawn up and put in practice. There\u2019s no denying that nature\u2019s recovery will be very slow, with vegetation taking up several decades. Long-term imperative: investment in climate adaptation Moving forward, Cyprus must invest substantively in bold climate adaptation measures that go well beyond covering emergency actions, compensations and reconstruction. The scientific projections are alarming: Cyprus will be the most economically harmed by excessive heat in the future among EU countries and ranks as having the highest current and future relative losses. However, if we adopt a proactive and preventive approach through systemic investments, we will avoid overwhelming costs in the long term. Scientists warn of cascading effects after the fire More specifically, according to a recent study by the Cyprus Institute which scrutinised the National Climate Adaptation Strategy, an additional investment of \u20ac3.4 billion at today\u2019s prices (or 0.4 per cent of national GDP) up to 2050 is essential to avoid far greater costs. The study concluded that this estimated amount is not prohibitive for the Cypriot economy and that such adaptation is a necessary investment to safeguard the island\u2019s national security and social well-being, not merely an expense. A prime example of such a necessary investment is the safeguarding of the Troodos mountain range. As the island\u2019s largest natural carbon sink, its primary water source, and a bastion of unique biodiversity, its health is synonymous with Cyprus\u2019 climate resilience. The recent fire is a stark warning \u2013 not protecting it effectively would be an unforgivable failure of foresight. A wake-up call This disaster has been a wake-up call for many of the affected and some not-yet affected rural communities, who are now organising themselves to clean up and restore, purchase firefighting vehicles and form coalitions in a bid to be better prepared in the future. Using some of the lessons on what went wrong this time, they now highlight the need to systematically create and maintain strategic firebreaks around their villages and critical infrastructure, they are working on tackling illegal dumping sites, preparing evacuation plans and considering options regarding modern detection technology that will enable a faster initial response, which is crucial for containing fires before they escalate. This mobilisation is a collective calling that must now be answered with policy and resources for an island-wide effect. Civil society can be the true catalyst for transformative change The path forward cannot be walked by isolated communities working independently, nor by corporations appearing as saviours, nor by the government which is stuck in a frustratingly inefficient way of operating. The true catalyst for transformative change lies within our civil society. NGOs and active citizens should be integrated into the heart of the planning process, as they are best positioned to identify local vulnerabilities and ensure promises are kept; they can put in practice innovations and test restoration methods; they can communicate the science by bridging the gap between research organisations and the public; they can raise awareness; they can organise volunteers and, ultimately, they can help turn grief into action. I have a million reasons for pessimism about this country and a thousand more for despair about how this fire was handled by the political leadership before, during and after the crisis. Yet I cannot help but feel hopeful whenever I hear stories about volunteers who managed to contain the fire with minimal means or whenever I engage with determined people who are already taking meaningful actions on the ground. These people prove that where leadership fails, citizen action prevails. And this is precisely the driving force that motivates groups such as Friends of the Earth that still remain actively committed to the collective fight for a better world.

ICIMOD seeks to improve their livelihoods by promoting what they term greener, more inclusive and climate resilient development. Canada's $15 million pledge will facilitate ICIMOD's goals, particularly for the region's most vulnerable populations: women and Indigenous Peoples.</p><p>\"Women have to take care of household matters, their elderly family and their children during extreme events. They are more vulnerable to climate change because of all these burdens,\" Abid Hussain, a senior economist and food systems specialist for ICIMOD, told GlacierHub in an interview. \"Indigenous people are less recognized in the policy process and in their access to institutional services like credit, technology and scientific knowledge. This specific project will actually focus on the empowerment of women and Indigenous communities.\"</p><p>Water access is the first issue the project plans to address in both the long- and short-term. Hussain explained that as glaciers continue to melt, the availability of water in the region is expected to peak around 2050 and then decline afterward. Many springs in the region are already drying up due to changes in precipitation and temperature. The construction of buildings in the area has also affected the region's underground hydrology.</p><p>\"There are 8 million springs in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region and 40-45% of springs are facing reduced water flow or are completely dry,\" said Hussain. ICIMOD has developed techniques that help communities and local governments revive their springs to mitigate water scarcity right now. They have also developed plans to help high altitude farms access spring water more easily, as these farms currently rely on glacier-fed irrigation systems that will not last in the long term.</p><p>\"Springs and rivers are flowing in the valleys. For agriculture fields on terraces, sometimes they are a bit higher in altitude,\" said Hussain. \"What we will do is use renewable energy to pump that revived spring water to irrigate their agriculture field. We call it an 'integrated solution' for agriculture.\"</p><p>The second step of the project is to build the adaptive capacity of women and Indigenous communities by granting them greater access to markets and providing financial and business education.</p><p>\"We will also train them, developing their agriculture farms into more business-oriented managements,\" said Hussain. These programs will teach them how to best use water resources and revive the springs. This education and training will improve resilience by supporting agriculture and increasing income.</p><p>The third and final challenge of the project is upscaling so that its practices can help other regions. The project aims to test these integrated solutions for future replication elsewhere. The impacts of funding a climate adaptation project of this kind could be widespread, particularly given the historical challenges climate finance has faced.</p><p>\"The biggest climate financing gaps are in areas where risk is perceived as high or where returns are uncertain, such as projects in emerging and developing economies, investments in adaptation, first-of-a-kind technologies and so on,\" Lisa Sachs, the director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, which is part of the Columbia Climate School, told GlacierHub in an interview.</p><p>Developing countries that are more vulnerable to climate change threats are reliant on wealthier states to provide them with climate adaptation funds.

Credit and currency risk is a major impediment to climate finance.\"</p><p>At the most recent Conference of the Parties, COP29, a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) was established. The purpose of the NCQG is to set a financial goal for supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation projects) in developing countries. A $1.3 trillion dollar target was set for climate projects by 2035. However, both Sachs and DeNoon felt that the NCQG needs improvement.</p><p>\"The NCQG from COP29 confirmed one basic and uncontroversial point: we need to scale climate finance to the trillions, and much of the financing will have to come from private capital markets,\" said Sachs. \"Beyond that, it delivered very little and was a genuine disappointment.

One of the key discussions was the session Business in the Climate of Tomorrow: Risks and Adaptation, dedicated to the challenges and opportunities that climate change opens up for the Russian economy. Experts noted that the lack of systemic adaptation measures could lead to losses for the Russian economy in the amount of up to RUB 3.1 tn annually. At the same time, the implementation of adaptation measures can bring a positive economic effect of RUB 300 bn. The discussion participants paid special attention to the role of technology. By 2035, the market for solutions based on generative AI will exceed USD 600 bn, and it is digital tools that are becoming a key factor in reducing climate risks and increasing business efficiency. During the session, Sber demonstrated its own experience of working with climate risks. The bank uses models that allow it to predict scenarios and assess the consequences: from short-term weather disasters to long-term processes, such as permafrost degradation. Thus, together with Sber, Vostokgosplan is developing an AI model for assessing potential damage to buildings and structures, based on climate scenarios and soil typology. The pilot was tested in Norilsk and Salekhard. In the future, it is planned to expand its use in other northern regions located at risk.</p><p/>", "publisher": "TendersInfo - News", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 8, "title": "Climate Adaptation vs. Mitigation Fail", "published": "2025-06-14", "bodyText": "<p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

While the continent contributes less than four per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions, it bears a disproportionate burden from climate extremes.</p><p>From tomorrow, African countries will gather in Addis Ababa for the Second Africa Climate Summit. Deliberations will focus on how to tackle climate challenges through new financing and adaptation measures. At the heart of these discussions lies a simple, sometimes overlooked fact: That the impact of climate change is most acutely felt through water. Either it's too much, too little or too polluted or a combination. Climate smart water resources management is therefore key to adaptation.</p><p>Many African river basins and aquifers span complex climatic zones and fragile socio-economic conditions. For example, the Nile basin traverses 11 countries, across arid and semi-arid, humid and semi-humid climatic zones, and the water demand is fast outstripping the available river flow. The Merti aquifer in Kenya and Somalia is another water system in a complex and fragile state, and a source of drinking water for about 12 million people. Africa's water crises are getting worse due to rising temperatures and extreme weather conditions along with challenges like rapid population growth, inadequate infrastructure, weak governance and instability. ;</p><p>Despite financial constraints, Africa is richly endowed with natural assets that must be used sustainably. This demands context-specific, science-grounded and socially acceptable solutions centered around water. What will form the backbone of short and long-term effective adaptation measures are strategic water resource assessments, mapping drought and flood-prone hotspot areas, robust monitoring systems, watershed protection and restoration, and climate-resilient policies that reduce inequality.</p><p>Adaptation strategies should leverage Africa-led research, partnerships and technological advances. Today, digital solutions are enabling smarter allocation of scarce water among competing users during droughts, and rapid flood mapping for disaster response. In addition to supporting emergency response, they improve the predictive capacities of climate extremes for better operational planning and management of water infrastructure. By increasing water availability and improving how water is managed, used and distributed, Africa can reduce its vulnerability to climate change impacts.</p><p>To support these strategies, credible science should be at the core of climate resilience and adaptation. African leaders and decision-makers must invest in and spearhead practical solutions. Firstly, discussions and actions should focus on issues such as improving data, information and knowledge generation to support policies that are timely and reliable for decision making and investments. Secondly, there is need to explore how Africa-led research can produce context-specific and scalable solutions that provide water access to different users and reduce inequality, including the competing needs from water, food and energy systems and the environment. Thirdly, there should be smart, practical interventions to strengthen communities' resilience as they encounter climate shocks.

There were 18 projects presented by the participants of Youth for Climate, an initiative by IPAM (Amazon Environmental Research Institute) which seeks to encourage university students from indigenous, quilombola and extractivist territories to take a leading role in preserving the biome.</p><p><br/>Each proposal addresses a local problem that the participants have identified in contact with leaders in their communities. The proposal is for young people to take on leadership roles in order to apply the knowledge they have acquired at university in practice.<br/>The connection with older residents and cultural heritage was central to the development of the proposals. With the help of an elder from her territory, the Alter do Ch\u00e3o Indigenous Land in western Par\u00e1, Rilary Borari, 22, built her project.<br/>The medical student's focus was to create something that would help the community to maintain the cultivation and use of medicinal plants - which has been undermined by the advance of deforestation in the region.<br/>\"It's a tourist area, so we see a lot of deforestation to build hotels. With that and the fires, we lose the natural vegetation and many medicinal plants,\" she explains.<br/>Rilary grew up in Alter do Ch\u00e3o but, four years ago, she moved to the south of the country to study medicine at the Federal University of the Southern Frontier (UFFS) in Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul. Away from home, she says it was challenging to structure the project and keep in touch with the village elders, but the project was a way of reconnecting with the community.<br/>With the help of the elder Raimunda, who teaches environmental education at the local school, the student catalogued species used in the territory, identifying active ingredients, ways of preparing them and therapeutic uses. Some of the seedlings were planted at the school, in a space accessible to the residents.<br/>The knowledge collected is being put together in a booklet to be used by the population. \"It's knowledge that's widely spread orally, but we wanted to materialize it.\"<br/>Rilary went to the village during her undergraduate vacation to take part in the construction of the vegetable garden. The initial plan, she says, was to create a garden that would serve the entire region and distribute the material documented with Raimunda to the villagers.

Like Rilary, she says that even from a distance, she wants to remain active, because the struggle of traditional communities needs to be recognized.<br/>\"Today, if I don't fight for this territory, if I don't fight for babassu, I'll stop fighting for my history, for a struggle that was my mother's, so that today I would be here studying.

This paper investigates climate change ABs among rural women in Uttarakhand, India, within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). A multistage sampling approach was employed, with purposive selection of two districts-Tehri Garhwal and Rudraprayag-identified as highly vulnerable to climate change. The study examines the relationships between perceived behavioral control (PBC), subjective norms, and attitudes by employing Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), exploring their influence on women's intention to adopt adaptation strategies. The findings indicate that PBC, risk perception (RP), and social norms (SN) significantly influence behavioral intention (BI) and adaptation behavior (AB). The analysis revealed that RP and PBC are major predictors of BI to adopt climate adaptation practices, with significant impacts from SN and self-efficacy beliefs.

According to news reporting originating from Thessaloniki, Greece, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The Mediterranean region, identified by scientists as a 'climate hot spot', is experiencing warmer and drier conditions, along with an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. One such extreme phenomena is droughts.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki: \"The recent wildfires in this region are a concerning consequence of this phenomenon, causing severe environmental damage and transforming natural landscapes. However, droughts involve a two-way interaction: On the one hand, climate change and various human activities, such as urbanization and deforestation, influence the development and severity of droughts. On the other hand, droughts have a significant impact on various sectors, including ecology, agriculture, and the local economy. This study investigates drought dynamics in four Mediterranean countries, Greece, France, Italy, and Spain, each of which has experienced severe wildfire events in recent years. Using satellite-based Earth observation data, we monitored drought conditions across these regions over a five-year period that includes the dates of major wildfires. To support this analysis, we derived and assessed key indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI). High-resolution satellite imagery processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform enabled the spatial and temporal analysis of these indicators. Our findings reveal that, in all four study areas, peak drought conditions, as reflected in elevated NDDI values, were observed in the months leading up to wildfire outbreaks. This pattern underscores the potential of satellite-derived indices for identifying regional drought patterns and providing early signals of heightened fire risk. The application of GEE offered significant advantages, as it allows efficient handling of long-term and large-scale datasets and facilitates comprehensive spatial analysis.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Our methodological framework contributes to a deeper understanding of regional drought variability and its links to extreme events; thus, it could be a valuable tool for supporting the development of adaptive management strategies.

We compare impacts for households in the program (REACH) and higher income non-REACH qualified households. We find that REACH homes, on average, save approximately 300kWh-eq on energy or $25 seasonally after purchasing an AC unit. While AC rebates reduce seasonal energy burden by 0.6 % in non-REACH homes, there is no statistically significant change in seasonal energy burden for REACH homes.

This includes the warming locked in due to the lag time between emissions and warming, as well as the warming yet to come from future emissions. Climate adaptation is many things, from planting mangroves to slow coastal erosion to rebuilding flood-damaged bridges to tolerate more extreme conditions.</p><p>For well over a decade, we and other climate adaptation scientists have called on successive governments to create a national plan to guide Australia's response. It's finally here. Is it up to the task?</p><p>The plan does many things right, such as describing which tier of government is responsible and laying out the government's thinking about future programs. But there are gaps. Proposed future actions are not clear nor proportionate to the challenge, while monitoring and tracking won't start for several years. Until we have effective monitoring, we won't know which actions work best - and which don't.</p><p>We should think of this plan as a vital starting point. Now the real work begins. Australia is huge and climate change will affect every sector. That means the government must choose carefully where to put their funding and to engage with others so they also contribute to overall action.</p><p>              Adapting to more intense flooding may require relocation and more durable infrastructure.  Pictured: an inundated farm near Windsor, New South Wales, in April 2024.                JohnCarnemolla/Getty</p><h>What's in the plan?</h><p>Released today, the government's National Adaptation Plan draws on the long-delayed National Climate Risk assessment, which outlines many of the escalating threats climate poses to humans, our activities and the environment. By releasing both together, the government is suggesting adaptation is a key way of responding to these threats.</p><p>This is true. But all adaptation has limits. Adaptation must be linked to emission reduction, given slower progress on emission reduction increases the need for climate adaptation. Later this week, the government will release its 2035 emission reduction targets.</p><p>The report lays out A$3.6 billion in spending since 2022 on policies which can benefit climate adaptation, and points to a further $9 billion by decade's end. That's not to say these are explicitly climate adaptation policies and initiatives - rather, they can support Australians to \"adapt and strengthen their resilience\", according to the plan, especially if climate adaptation aspects are integrated. For example, the $1 billion Disaster Ready fund has aspects directly tackling climate adaptation, while the $200 million Urban Rivers and Catchments program greening city rivers has more indirect benefits.</p><p>It's widely accepted climate adaptation can have very high returns on investment. For instance, a 2022 Insurance Council of Australia report estimates $1 spent on resilience returns $9.60 by avoiding future financial, health and social damage. Given this return, are we under-investing?</p><p>Some adaptations such as early warning systems for disasters, nature-based solutions to slow floodwaters and building climate-smart homes can save many times the initial investment. But others may not be.</p><p>The report has a welcome focus on \"betterment\" - rebuilding bridges, roads or other infrastructure after a disaster to be better adapted for the next one.</p><p>On agriculture, Australian farmers have been adapting well to the climate changes to date. But the report indicates existing adaptation options are unlikely to be able to meet the rapid, large-scale changes likely to arrive.

Different rice classes exhibit distinct vulnerabilities: medium-grain japonica varieties show reduced amylose under heat stress, aromatic varieties experience disrupted aroma synthesis under drought, and long-grain types suffer kernel damage under combined stresses. Temperature is a key driver, with quality deterioration occurring above 35 \u00b0C and below 15 \u00b0C. Systems biology analyses reveal complex signalling networks underpinning these stress responses, although experimental validation remains limited. The Australian industry has responded by developing cold-tolerant cultivars, precision agriculture, and water-saving practices, yet projected climate variability demands more integrated strategies. Priorities include breeding for stress-resilient quality traits, refining water management, and deploying advanced phenotyping tools.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Emerging technologies like hyperspectral imaging and machine learning offer promise for rapid quality assessment and adaptive management.

According to news originating from Shaanxi, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Climate change poses a significant threat to wheat production, critically impacting global food security. However, the extent to which recent genetic advances in wheat breeding affect climate sensitivity and yield under varying environmental conditions remains unclear.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Key Research and Development Technology Projects in Shaanxi Province, Xi'an Science and Technology Programme Project, Shandong Key Research and Development Programme Project. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Northwest A&amp;F University, \"Using a dataset of 9669 wheat varieties released between 2012 and 2023, we analysed genetic progress in wheat cultivation across waterland and dryland ecotypes under current climate conditions. Our findings indicate that recent breeding advances have improved wheat yield resilience to climate stress, particularly under waterland conditions. In these environments, the combined effects of mean temperature (Tmean), precipitation, and solar radiation led to yield increases of 9.3 % and 8.7 % in the advanced breeding series, compared with 8.1 % for the check variety (CK). Under dryland conditions, climate change led to yield losses of 4.6 % and 4.8 % for the advanced breeding series. Nevertheless, they still performed better than CK, which experienced a larger reduction of 6.4 %. Further analysis revealed that the advanced breeding series showed improved yield responses to Tmean, with gains 0.95 % and 2.07 % higher than CK under waterland conditions. Our findings also indicate that recent genetic advances have reduced the sensitivity of wheat yield to adverse climate factors, particularly under waterland conditions, suggesting a positive role of breeding in enhancing resilience. However, under dryland conditions, although breeding reduced yield losses compared to CK under temperature and precipitation variations, overall yield gains were not realized. These results suggest that while wheat breeding has enhanced climate resilience under waterland conditions, further improvement is needed in dryland environments.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Future breeding strategies should focus on enhancing adaptability across diverse ecotypes to secure sustainable wheat production under climate change.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Breeding Advances In Climate Adaptation of Winter Wheat Across Diverse Ecotypes In China.

This study investigated selection signatures in Lao native goats using Illumina's Goat SNP50 BeadChip, analysing 420 Lao native goats, 87 goats from three Chinese breeds, and 51 Teddi goats from Pakistan as test populations. We applied the de-correlation composite multiple signals (DCMS) method, incorporating p values from nine statistical tests, including runs of homozygosity in the Lao goat population, and fixation index and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity between Lao goats and test populations. Significant genomic regions were identified using a 0.05 threshold adjusted for multiple testing. Our results uncovered 24 genomic regions harbouring 68 unique-coding genes. Analysis revealed both annotated and novel candidate genes linked to a variety of characteristics, including adaptation to the tropical monsoon climate (e.g., ABHD6, GATA4 and MSRA) and economic traits like growth and status (e.g., CNTNAP5, FAM135B and GATA4), reproduction (e.g., NPHP3, ARSJ and GATA4), milk production (e.g., MRPL32, PRSS51 and EPHA7), and carcass characteristics (e.g., GNAI1, SOX7 and FAM135B).

Five interrelated themes were uncovered relating to the lived experiences of service providers in making decisions including climate impacts, community engagement and equity, adaptation programs, resources, and cost-benefit analysis. In making those decisions, the most used information sources and tools were community and tribal knowledge, reports like climate assessment reports, and specialized data portals such as Cal-Adapt, CalEnviroScreen, and Healthy Places Index.

According to news reporting originating in Milan, Italy, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Groundwater is facing shortage scenarios worldwide due to a changing climate, but systems governed by different recharge processes may react differently. Hence, understanding groundwater budget components is critical for sustainable resource management.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the University of Milano Bicocca, \"This study analyzes seasonal groundwater level patterns from ca. 60 wells, investigating different hydrogeological contexts and water management practices. In the first phase, data under baseline conditions (2013-2021) are analyzed to identify the average seasonal patterns and the associated recharge and discharge processes. Successively, the 2022 data is compared with baseline data to quantify the effect of the hydrological drought. Results show that in surface-water-fed irrigation areas, the absence of surface water during the 2022 summer, related to winter snow scarcity in the Alps, caused significant disruption of the typical groundwater seasonal profile. The winter groundwater table decrease was more than twice the average decrease under baseline conditions, and the summer rise was the 30% of the average rise under baseline conditions. This is related to the missing recharge and the increased abstraction of groundwater to fill the lack of surface water for irrigation needs. Therefore, in a scenario of dryer summers linked to climate change, the plausible transition toward more efficient irrigation methods or groundwater irrigation could cause severe groundwater depletion and compensation measures will be needed. Conversely, in groundwater-fed irrigation areas, the increased irrigation needs during the 2022 summer determined a summer groundwater depletion 76% wider than the average summer depletion under baseline conditions. Here, mitigation actions to reduce abstracted volumes, such as transitioning to more efficient irrigation systems, could reduce groundwater vulnerability to climate change.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"On the other hand, aquifer systems governed by natural recharge and discharge processes showed a wider pluriannual variability associated with dry and wet years and resulted less vulnerable to single dry seasons than highly anthropic systems.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: The Dual Role of Irrigation In the Groundwater Budget Under Baseline Conditions Versus the 2022 Drought: Lessons for Future Climate Adaptation.

This study aimed to identify health and wellbeing co-benefits of climate change adaptation and mitigation, assess the perceived relevance and importance of co-benefits to policy and programme evaluation, and assess data availability to measure co-benefits.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Act Environment, Planning And Sustainable Development Directorate. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Australian National University: \"The relevance, importance, and data availability of 24 co-benefits of climate policies and programmes identified from a prior scoping review were surveyed using Delphi methodology by experts across diverse policy areas using the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) as a case study. We created an opportunity score that represented the combined relevance and importance for each co-benefit. Experts also identified additional co-benefits and provided qualitative responses, with agreement with the first round results assessed in the second round. We found that co-benefits that were rated as highly relevant were generally rated as highly important. The top five co-benefits based on opportunity score (relevance x importance) included: reduced mental health burden; increased comfort in the home; improved disaster preparedness; improvement in physical health; and economic benefits from averted healthcare costs. A high degree of consensus was achieved for all five top co-benefits, as well as those considered not relevant or important, indicating agreement on highest and lowest priority co-benefits across a range of climate change interventions and government directorates.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"While most co-benefits with high opportunity scores had available data, the availability of quality data was a key concern, with over half the identified co-benefits having no available data or uncertain data availability. Future research needs to develop a standardised methodology to measure co-benefits that incorporates indicators considered most relevant and important by experts, with the prioritisation of co-benefits in this Delphi study providing a guide for research and evaluation in other contexts beyond the ACT.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Opportunity for health and wellbeing co-benefits of climate adaptation policies and programs: a Delphi study in the Australian Capital Territory.

No industry is immune to risks such as floods, droughts, storms, or fires. We all remember the severe consequences from events such as the LA wildfires or Hurricanes in the US. Businesses are interrupted, and economic and insured losses are exploding into hundreds of billions of US-Dollars per year. Therefore, it is so important to understand climate risks and your exposure to them. This is why we developed CAReS, so our clients have the option to address and mitigate their risks as well as to avoid surging insurance costs in the future\", explains Michele Williams, Global Head of Allianz Risk Consulting (ARC) at Allianz Commercial.</p><p>CAReS is a data-driven platform combined with tailored risk consulting expertise</p><p>CAReS translates physical climate risks into financial and physical loss metrics at portfolio and location level and helps businesses to manage these risks with resilience consultancy. The data-driven platform allows companies to perform climate risk assessments to identify and prioritize high climate risk exposures for their key assets including own locations, new investments and supplier locations. In a five-step process, they can understand their climate risks and their impact on their assets. Furthermore, businesses can identify and prioritize highly exposed locations in a dashboard solution with different risk scores for 12 perils, including tropical storms, floods, hail, wildfire or extreme heat. Four different timelines are available: present day, 2030, 2050, and 2080. This allows businesses to directly address potential risks as well as financial impacts in the future and mitigate them, working closely with ARC experts. CAReS is the first in a set of solutions and offerings Allianz Risk Consulting is planning to launch this year as part of a new strategic positioning which emphasizes the relevance of resilience.</p><p>\"Resilience is a journey, not a destination. By proactively managing climate risks you can mitigate potential disruptions to your business and stay one step ahead. This is a win-win situation for Allianz Commercial as an insurer as well as for the client who can reduce its climate risks and potential losses in the future\", says Michael Bruch, Head of Global ARC Advisory Services at Allianz Commercial.</p><p>You can find more information <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommercial.allianz.com%2Fservices%2Frisk-consulting%2Fcares.html&amp;esheet=54284759&amp;newsitemid=20250702484681&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=4&amp;md5=149f914f4e2f75fc8ae9f62c9c4024a3\">here</url> .</p><p>About Allianz Commercial</p><p>Allianz Commercial is the center of expertise and global line of Allianz Group for insuring mid-sized businesses, large enterprises and specialist risks.

According to news reporting originating from Suzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Problem definition: Most of the world's population relies on coastal aquifers for freshwater supplies. Groundwater is experiencing substantial overdrafts and facing evermounting freshwater demand.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Soochow University, \"Existing groundwater management strategies are myopic and fail to coordinate production and the operation of protection approaches, including seawater intrusion barriers (SWIBs) and managed aquifer recharge (MAR). Motivated by the urgency of sustainable groundwater management, we investigate how to optimize the joint operations of groundwater production, protection (by injecting fresh water through SWIBs), and replenishment (via MAR). Methodology/results: We model a central planner's decision on groundwater production, freshwater injection quantities, and artificial replenishment using stochastic dynamic models and identify that the optimal groundwater management policies follow a threshold-type structure. We find that SWIBs and MAR are strategic complements, except in cases with very high groundwater levels, when they turn into strategic substitutes. When the penalty for low groundwater levels decreases, the planner should use SWIBs more aggressively if groundwater levels are low and more conservatively if they are high. A similar pattern holds when natural recharge becomes more abundant, assuming that the natural recharge quantity has no impact on the purchasing cost of imported water. Moreover, we calibrate our model using real data sets in Orange County, California and find that the joint operations of SWIBs and MAR expand groundwater operational flexibility. In contrast, employing SWIBs alone comes at the expense of a lower groundwater level. Managerial implications: Our analysis offers strategic guidance on when to use SWIBs and MAR as complements or substitutes based on groundwater levels.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"It highlights the value of their joint operation in stabilizing groundwater, especially amid worsening droughts.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Coastal Groundwater Management: Seawater Intrusion Prevention, Artificial Recharge, and Climate Adaptation.

According to news reporting originating from Milano, Italy, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The LCZ-UHI-GEO project is an international collaboration between Italy and Vietnam, aiming to analyse urban climate dynamics, particularly the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, through geospatial techniques. The project focuses on four major cities-Rome and Milan in Italy, and Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Polytechnic University Milan: \"The project's objectives include mapping Local Climate Zones (LCZ) using Earth Observation (EO) data and mapping high-resolution air temperature based on in-situ and EO data. A key highlight is the integration of hyperspectral (HS) imagery from the PRISMA satellite to improve LCZ classification accuracy compared to traditional multispectral (MS) data. This paper presents the first experiments carried out for LCZ mapping in Rome and air temperature mapping in Milan. In Rome, LCZ mapping achieved 88.1% overall accuracy using PRISMA imagery, outperforming Sentinel-2 data which obtained an accuracy of 73.7%. Air temperature mapping in Milan employed a machine learning (ML) based interpolation combining Sentinel-2 data, GIS data, in-situ official weather station data, and crowdsourced Netatmo sensor measurements. Temperatures were modelled for the summer of 2022 for five specific diurnal periods, namely 4-6 AM, 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM, 6-8 PM, and 9 PM-12 AM. The resulting high-resolution temperature maps revealed distinctive UHI patterns for each period, with peak intensity observed during night-time. The model performed well across different periods, achieving an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.4\u00b0C.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Future work will expand PRISMA data collection and provide multi-temporal LCZ and temperature mapping, particularly in Vietnamese cities.

According to news reporting out of Zagreb, Croatia, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Urbanisation and land-use change are among the main pressures on soil health in periurban areas, but the multifunctionality of grassland soils is still not sufficiently recognised. In this study, the physical and chemical properties of soils under grassland, forest and croplands in the periurban area of Zagreb were investigated in a two-year period.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include European Commission. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Zagreb Faculty of Agriculture: \"Grasslands consistently exhibited multifunctional benefits, including high organic matter content (4.68% vs. 2.24% in cropland), improved bulk density (1.14 vs. 1.24 g cm<sup>-3</sup>) and an active carbon cycle indicated by increased CO [ [2] ] emissions (up to 1403 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> in 2021). Forest soils showed the highest aggregate stability (91.4%) and infiltration (0.0006 cm s<sup>-1</sup>), while croplands showed signs of structural degradation with the highest bulk density and lowest water retention (39.9%). Temporal variation showed that grassland was particularly responsive to favourable climatic conditions, with soil porosity and water content improving yearly. Principal component analysis showed that soil structure, biological activity and moisture regulation were linked, with grassland plots favourably positioned along the axes of resilience. The absence of tillage and the presence of permanent vegetation cover contributed to their high capacity for climate and water regulation and carbon sequestration. These results emphasise the importance of protecting and managing grasslands as an important component of urban green areas. Practices such as mulching, minimal disturbance and continuous cover can maximise the ecosystem services of grassland soils.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In addition, the results highlight the potential risk of trace metal accumulation in cropland and grassland soils located near urban and farming infrastructure, underlining the need for regular monitoring in periurban environments. Integrating grassland functions into urban planning and policy is essential for improving the sustainability and resilience of periurban landscapes.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: The Role of Grassland Land Use in Enhancing Soil Resilience and Climate Adaptation in Periurban Landscapes.

It looks at EU policies requirements and the extent to which current EO services meet those needs, and it identifies the gaps and the potential improvements that could be made in the future. The system that connects EO data to real-world decisions is still developing, and many opportunities are being missed. To make the most of satellite data, the EU would benefit from more accessible, standardised tools that can guide both local and national actions.", "To get more value out of EO, the report recommends:* Developing clear, policy-focused indicators that show risk and outcomes* Offering more advanced services to detect climate risks and changes over time* Creating tools that help cities explore different adaptation scenarios* Supporting networks that share knowledge and experience in using EO for climate action* Improving the resolution and detail of satellite data to better match city needsA key innovation in the study is the Earth Observation Value Chain Framework - it illustrates how intelligence can be derived and synthesised using a hazard-vulnerability-exposure nexus to address a variety of user needs, culminating in cumulative policy impact.

The report, \"Climate Adaptation Approaches for Water and Electric Utilities,\" highlights the impacts of climate change on these critical sectors and provides a range of adaptation solutions.</p><p>The report, prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830, was authored by Isabel Van Dyke, Kamila Kazimierczuk, Alan Cooke, Rebecca Tapio, and Juliet Homer. It emphasizes that climate change is straining resources and operations for both water and electric providers, exposing infrastructure to more intense events, and disrupting services to customers. The report identifies climate drivers such as extreme weather, temperature increases, and sea-level rise, and the associated risks to water and electric systems.</p><p>The authors stress that utilities must prepare for a range of future climate scenarios by implementing proactive measures. The report serves as a repository of examples and resources for utilities seeking to enhance their adaptive capacity. It draws from various sources, including climate vulnerability assessments, mitigation plans, storm protection plans, wildfire mitigation plans, and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Creating Resilient Water Utilities (CRWU) program.</p><p>The report identifies several adaptation strategies that are common to both water and electric utilities. For instance, both sectors are addressing sea-level rise and storm surges by relocating or elevating vulnerable assets, and adapting to extreme heat by adjusting work practices and providing specialized training and equipment for workers.</p><p>Key adaptation strategies highlighted in the report include:</p><p>* Climate Uncertainty: Conducting vulnerability and resilience studies, developing climate risk models, and implementing protocols for decision-making under deep uncertainty.</p><p>* Sea Level Rise and Storm Surges: Protecting vulnerable equipment, relocating infrastructure, and installing emergency alert systems.</p><p>* Extreme Temperature Events: Weatherizing equipment, developing new equipment standards, and implementing worker safety programs.</p><p>* Droughts: Developing drought contingency and demand management plans.</p><p>* Wildfires: Improving communication between water and electric utilities, developing fire management plans, and enhancing weather forecasting.</p><p>* Extreme Weather and Natural Disasters: Ensuring redundancy through backup power supplies and equipment, retrofitting infrastructure, and entering into mutual aid agreements.</p><p>The report also emphasizes the importance of integrated water-electric adaptation, given the interdependencies between the two sectors. It notes that collaboration can lead to more impactful, system-level outcomes. Furthermore, the report addresses the need to extend climate adaptation to all communities, particularly those that are climate-vulnerable, by incorporating equity metrics and community engagement into planning processes.</p><p>In conclusion, the report underscores that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to climate change adaptation. However, utilities and regulators can learn from each other's experiences to tailor their approaches. Proactive planning and adaptation can enhance resilience, reduce costs, and foster collaboration between the water and electric industries.</p><p>* * *</p><p>View report at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnnl.gov/publications/climate-adaptation-approaches-water-and-electric-utilities-compendium-existing\">https://www.pnnl.gov/publications/climate-adaptation-approaches-water-and-electric-utilities-compendium-existing</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9217999 MSTRUCK</p>", "publisher": "Targeted News Service", "instances": ["Department of Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory released a report on Jan. 18, 2025 examining how water and electric utilities are adapting to climate change, offering a compendium of strategies to address the increasing challenges.

The bourse operator's research found that more than 2,100 companies were able to generate over $1 trillion of combined revenues last year from products and services that contribute to so-called climate adaptation. The study looked at companies in sectors ranging from logistics to food processing and real estate, LSEG said Monday. It's the latest example that climate strategies focused on adapting to the physical shocks of global warming are gaining traction. </p><p>With the world now set to blast well past the critical threshold to be had from investing in adaptation strategies. \"Adaptation and resilience are becoming additional sources of growth for the green economy,\" Jaakko Kooroshy, LSEG's global head of sustainable investment research, said in an interview. \"The attention on physical risk is increasing and the measures that companies and governments are taking around adaptation will translate into real dollars.\" Even with strong political headwinds, corporate sector revenues from green activities, whether enabling mitigation or adaptation, remain resilient, he added. \"One question that we are getting a lot at the moment is: 'With the Trump administration in office, what does that mean for the green economy?'\" Kooroshy said. The answer is \"this thing is now so big and so robust, it's not going to implode just like that,\" he said. LSEG based its analysis on more than 20,000 companies globally, assessing their contributions to the so-called green economy. The study, which is the sixth annual assessment of its kind conducted by the bourse operator and data provider, found that adaptation-related revenues last year accounted for roughly a fifth of the $5 trillion global green economy. Green buildings and water infrastructure sectors were the biggest contributors, it found. In light of the financial flows into adaptation, investors are keen to identify companies with exposure to the theme, LSEG said. There are currently few companies whose entire business targets adaptation, but plenty with a portion of their revenue derived from the theme, Kooroshy said. For example, about 6% of revenue at Thales SA, a French aerospace and defense firm, stems from the manufacture of meteorological satellites that are used to monitor climate change. At Japanese civil engineering company Raito Kogyo Co., 31% of revenue is tied to activities including tackling land erosion and soil decontamination. And US waste management firm Clean Harbors Inc. gets 77% from a range of adaptation strategies, the LSEG study shows. If all companies deriving revenue from climate-positive strategies - dubbed the green economy by LSEG - were taken as a single industry group, they would have had the second-best financial performance of any equity sector over the past decade, it said. The exchange operator's definition of the green economy extends beyond public equities, and also encompasses infrastructure, commodities, private equity and fixed-income markets, it said. A good way for investors to gain access to adaptation strategies is via green bonds, LSEG said. The instruments, whose proceeds are earmarked for specific environmental projects, are \"the gateway to adaptation finance\" and present an \"attractive opportunity\" for governments and businesses to finance climate adaptation, LSEG said. \"Mitigation still remains much, much cheaper than adaptation, and investing in resilience upfront remains much cheaper than disaster recovery,\" Kooroshy said. However, even in a world in which warming is limited to 1.5 C, \"you will need adaptation,\" he said. \"And we're not on the track for a 1.5 C world.

(June 3, 2025) -- As climate hazards like floods and wildfires intensify -- and global financial resources grow tighter -- a new study (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/research/climate-adaptation-investment-case\">https://www.wri.org/research/climate-adaptation-investment-case</url>) by World Resources Institute (WRI) presents powerful evidence that bolstering funding for adaptation and resilience is not only urgent but also one of the smartest development investments available today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The study, which analyzed 320 adaptation and resilience investments across 12 countries totaling $133 billion, finds that every $1 invested in adaptation and resilience generates more than $10 in benefits over ten years. This translates to potential returns of over $1.4 trillion, with average returns of 27%.</p><p>Some sectors record even greater returns. Health sector investments, for example, are projected to deliver returns of over 78%, driven by the high benefits of protecting lives from climate-related impacts like heat stress, malaria and dengue fever. Investments in disaster risk management, such as early warning systems, also showed exceptionally high returns derived from safeguarding lives and infrastructure.</p><p>The study defines adaptation investments as those aimed at reducing or managing physical climate risks, such as climate-smart agriculture, expanded health services and urban flood protection. However, in many cases, the resulting development and social benefits matched or exceeded the avoided losses from climate impacts.</p><p>\"This research has pried open the lid on what resilience is truly worth -- and even that first glimpse is staggering\", said Sam Mugume Koojo, Co-Chair of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action from Uganda. \"It's time for leaders to recognize climate adaptation is not just a safety net but a launch pad for development.\"</p><p>WRI evaluated projects based on three key types of returns (commonly referred to as the \"triple dividend of resilience\"): avoided losses from climate disasters; induced economic gains (e.g. job creation and increased crop yields); and broader social and environmental benefits (e.g. improved health systems, biodiversity). On average, benefits were fairly evenly distributed across all three types. Yet only 8% of investment appraisals estimated the full monetized values of these dividends -- suggesting that actual rates of return are substantially underestimated in economic assessments of most adaptation investments.</p><p>Benefits beyond avoiding climate shocks</p><p>While adaptation investments have traditionally focused on reducing climate vulnerability and strengthening the resilience of investments, the study finds that over 50% of their documented benefits occur even if climate-related disasters do not happen.</p><p>Infrastructure built to better manage extreme weather events may provide year-round value: irrigation systems can support diverse cropping patterns and evacuation centers may double as community hubs. Nature-based solutions -- such as watershed, wetland and coastal protections -- frequently provide added ecological and recreational benefits.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that investing in adaptation is not just a protective measure -- it also helps advance countries' broader development priorities and sustainable development goals.</p><p>\"One of our most striking findings is that adaptation projects aren't just paying off when disasters happen -- they generate value every day through more jobs, better health and stronger local economies,\" said Carter Brandon, Senior Fellow, WRI. \"That's a major mind shift: policymakers don't need a disaster to justify resilience -- it's simply smart development.\"</p><p>Adaptation investments also cut carbon and protect nature</p><p>Nearly half of the analyzed adaptation investments are also expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions, showing that adaptation and mitigation often go hand in hand. This overlap could open the door to greater climate finance from investors focused on lowering emissions.</p><p>The strongest examples of this win-win were found in energy, forestry, transport, cities and agriculture sectors. Many of these projects use nature-based solutions that sequester carbon and deliver ecological benefits, such as urban tree planting to reduce heat or stabilizing hillsides to reduce erosion.</p><p>Recommendations for policymakers</p><p>Based on these findings, WRI recommends that government leaders treat adaptation as an engine for economic opportunity and fully integrate resilience into national development strategies. The paper also calls for a standardized approach to measuring and reporting adaptation outcomes, which would improve investments' comparability, transparency and accountability.</p><p>The study builds on the Adapt Now report released by WRI and the Global Commission on Adaptation in 2019 and was prompted by the G20 and the government of Brazil's interest in better evidence of economic benefits from investing in resilience.</p><p>\"This evidence gives leaders and non-State actors exactly what they need heading into COP30: a clear economic case for scaling adaptation,\" said Dan Ioschpe, Climate High-Level Champion for COP30. \"Belem must become a turning point - mainstreaming resilience into national and local priorities and unlocking the full potential of non-state actors' leadership.\"</p><p>About World Resources Institute</p><p>WRI is a trusted partner for change.

According to news reporting from Oslo, Norway, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The Climate House at Toyen in Oslo is a nearly Zero Emission Building (nZEB) designed for exhibitions and educational purposes.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Oslo Metropolitan University: \"It operates with a hybrid ventilation system, where natural ventilation via operable windows serves as the primary strategy, supplemented by mechanical ventilation when natural ventilation alone cannot maintain acceptable indoor thermal comfort and air quality. However, monitoring and analysis indicate that the current ventilation system underperforms, particularly during the winter season, resulting in suboptimal thermal comfort and reduced energy efficiency. This study aims to investigate whether optimized hybrid ventilation control strategies can be beneficial in nZEB buildings in cold climates, both under current and future conditions. A new control strategy was tested using IDA-ICE 5.0 simulations, prioritizing mechanical ventilation while using natural ventilation as a supplement. Results show a 13% energy reduction compared to full mechanical ventilation, with improved thermal comfort and compliance with indoor air quality standards. When tested under future climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.6), the strategy yields energy savings of 19%-21% by 2050 and up to 30% by 2100.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"However, under extreme heat conditions in 2100, the system may struggle with overheating, indicating the need for higher airflow rates and extended night ventilation. Overall, the findings suggest that, with adaptive control, hybrid ventilation is a promising solution for improving energy efficiency in low-energy buildings in cold climates-even as temperatures rise.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Exploring hybrid ventilation in cold climates: energy efficiency, thermal comfort, and future climate adaptation in a nZEB case study in Norway.

According to news reporting originating in Timisoara, Romania, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"This study examines the critical role of institutional quality in driving corporate adaptation to climate change within the EU-27 member states from 2006 to 2023. It aims to investigate how governance factors-control of corruption, government effectiveness, rule of law, and regulatory quality-influence business strategies for environmental resilience and sustainability, focusing on environmental investments and industrial production.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitalization. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the West University of Timisoara, \"Employing fixed and random effects regression models on a balanced panel dataset, we analyze two dependent variables: environmental protection investment corporations (EPIC), measuring investments in pollution prevention and environmental degradation reduction, and industrial production (IP), reflecting output in mining, manufacturing, and utilities. A composite institutional quality index, derived through principal component analysis (PCA) from the four governance indicators, captures their collective impact, reducing multicollinearity and enhancing analytical robustness. Control variables, including final energy consumption, environmental tax revenues, expenditure on environmental protection, and a Paris Agreement dummy, are incorporated to test the institutional quality effect. Results demonstrate that higher institutional quality significantly enhances EPIC, particularly in countries with greater environmental tax revenues, indicating that robust governance and fiscal policies incentivize sustainable corporate investments. Conversely, the effect on IP is less consistent, with higher fossil energy consumption and lower environmental tax revenues driving production, suggesting a reliance on high-polluting industries. The Paris Agreement positively influences IP, reflecting stronger climate-focused industrial strategies post-2015. These findings underscore the pivotal interplay between institutional quality and environmental fiscal policies in fostering corporate adaptation to climate change. Over the long term, strong governance is essential for aligning business practices with sustainability goals, reducing environmental degradation, and mitigating climate risks across the EU.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This study highlights the need for cohesive policies to support green investments and transition industries toward renewable energy sources, addressing disparities in environmental performance among EU member states.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Bridges or Barriers?

We surveyed current coastal climate adaptation projects in Canada, which include a mix of nature-based, hard infrastructure, relocation, and hybrid projects, and performed a literature review to assess adaptation projects' potential social equity risks based on the information available. We find that all adaptation plans have the potential of generating equity risks, with different kinds of interventions potentially generating different risks, such as redirecting climate impacts to other communities, displacing communities, and promoting development in risky areas. Adaptation projects are more likely to experience maladaptive social outcomes when they are planned and implemented by people removed from the impacted communities, as this removal often creates oversights in exactly who and how people will be impacted. Maladaptive outcomes may also be the result of processing and funding limitations. Conversely, we found that there are important mediating steps that can limit or avoid maladaptive outcomes, most importantly inclusive planning processes where marginalized groups are involved in decision-making.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We argue that this risk-based approach to purposely outline potential maladaptive outcomes are important to assess how adaptation projects may perpetuate the historical marginalization, dispossession, and displacement of marginalized communities.

The results showed that high temperatures significantly reduced tourist flows in both urban and rural areas, with a more pronounced impact observed in rural areas. This reduction altered spatial patterns, shifting from a multicentric distribution to an urban-centered concentration. Furthermore, high temperatures affected the timing of tourist flows differently across regions.

Rising seas will bring increased tidal flood hazards for people and property.</p><p>The team's research shows larger estuaries like the Clyde, which covers 120 square kilometres, are at greater risk of damaging floods because they connect directly to the sea.</p><p>Their study demonstrated that, during extreme weather events, vast additional volumes of tidal seawater will be carried onto land along the banks of the Clyde.</p><p>The team say that adapting to these additional flood waters means that larger, strategic interventions will be required to allow tidal floodwater to collect and drain without causing extensive damage to land surrounding the Clyde.</p><p>At the same time, they found that the tidal flood hazard for cities built near smaller estuaries could still be significantly lowered with smaller-scale interventions. This is because larger estuaries attract larger tidal volume during extreme events like storm surges.</p><p>Their findings could help fine-tune the effectiveness of many cities' plans for alleviating flood risk, particularly managed realignment, an increasingly adopted method of mitigating flood risk by giving space for tidal flooding. It aims to use a more sustainable, nature-based approach to minimise the damage tidal floods can cause to low-lying coastal towns and cities, which are currently home to around 60% of the world's population.</p><p>Instead of building sea walls around cities to keep flood waters at bay - which fight rather than work with nature - managed realignment encourages the cultivation of natural wetland areas like saltmarshes along estuaries to absorb and slow down tidal flood waters. It also advocates for moving people and buildings away from areas at risk of being overtaken by flood water and avoiding new construction in areas likely to be worst-affected by tidal flooding now and in the future.</p><p>In a new paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the team from the University of Glasgow's School of Geographical &amp; Earth Sciences discuss the outcomes of their modelling, which is built on data from a hydrodynamic model recently commissioned by Glasgow City Council.</p><p>Their model tested scenarios for extreme tidal flood events by simulating how tidal flood extent will change for different combinations of managed realignment areas in Renfrewshire, Newshot Island, Longhaugh and the Erskine Bridge. These scenarios explored different sizes of intervention, ranging from 0.15 to 3.3 square kilometres.</p><p>The researchers modelled the effectiveness of the managed realignments against worst-case-scenario flooding along the Clyde, both in the present and for a projected year, 2100. In 2100, sea level is projected to rise an additional 85 cm under a high-emissions climate scenario.</p><p>Their simulations showed that the effectiveness of managed realignment was limited in preventing the spread of flood waters. In the present-day scenario, tidal flood waters covered 13.6 square kilometres of land along the Clyde without any managed realignment. In the 2100 scenario, water covered 19.2 square kilometres. With managed realignment measures in place, the extent of the flood was reduced by between 0.32% and 9.76%.</p><p>Dr Octria Prasojo is the paper's corresponding author. He said: \"We were surprised by the results, which showed that managed realignment measures along the Clyde Estuary produced smaller reductions in tidal flood extent than we might have anticipated even when more than three square kilometres of space is devoted to tidal flood management.\"</p><p>Paper co-author Dr Martin Hurst said: \"For many cities built next to river systems, the volume of water which can contribute to flooding is limited by the amount of water which comes from the upstream river flow or rain. In the case of cities like Glasgow, however, where rivers are connected to the sea, the volume of water which can contribute to tidal flooding is vastly increased.\"</p><p>The team's paper also examined data from previously-published studies of managed realignment efforts in eight others estuaries across the UK, each smaller than the Clyde up to a maximum of 108 square kilometres. They found a correlation between the size of those estuaries and the effectiveness of their managed realignment - the smaller the estuary, the more effectively flood waters could be managed by managed realignment. For every 20% relative increase in the size of managed realignment, flood waters could be reduced by around 14%, the team showed.</p><p>Dr Prasojo added: \"What we've found in this study is that managed realignment works very well when appropriately-sized locations are chosen to deal with tidal flood waters, and it works particularly well in smaller estuaries. However, there comes a point where that alleviation strategy starts to require larger and larger areas of land to be devoted to managed realignment, which may not be practical in more densely-populated areas. Effectiveness depends on where and how large managed realignment is allocated relative to the size of the estuary.\"</p><p>Professor Larissa Naylor, a co-author of the paper, said: \"We hope the results will help lead to better-informed urban planning to mitigate the effects of climate change as sea levels rise and extreme weather events become increasingly common.\"</p><p>The research is one of the outcomes from the Glasgow as a Living Lab Accelerating Novel Transformation (GALLANT) project, led by the University of Glasgow's Centre for Sustainable Solutions. GALLANT, which is supported by pound sterling10.5m from the Natural Environment Research Council, is working with 29 programme partners including Glasgow City Council to develop new methods of climate resilience which also address health, social and economic inequalities.</p><p>Professor Jaime Toney is GALLANT's principal investigator. She said: \"What this study shows clearly is that cities built on estuaries will need to carefully consider how they plan to mitigate the worst effects of climate change-induced tidal flooding in the years to come.</p><p>\"Adopting a 'right size, right place' approach to managed realignment will be key to ensuring that infrastructure damage is minimised, along with the associated costs of repair. For many cities, that will mean making informed decisions about new structural developments and land uses that are close to the water, and long-term planning that considers future flood risks appropriately within the wider context of conflicting land-use priorities and societal needs.\"</p><p>Professor Richard Williams, Professor Larissa Naylor and Dr Martin Hurst of the University of Glasgow's School of Geographical &amp; Earth Sciences co-authored the paper.

King travelled to Mongolia with the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to cook and film with Mongolian herders, as part of a new episode of its Recipes for Change series, released today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I am admirative of the willingness and courage of Mongolian herders to learn how to adapt to fast changing and extreme weather conditions and find new ways to preserve their future and their unique culture,\" said Si King. \"Adapting to climate change is essential and urgent to preserve food production, which are ancestral ways of life of Mongolian herders. It can be achieved with simple technics, such as a water well, a storage to keep fodder during harsh winters, or better pasture management technics.\"</p><p>Last April, Si King travelled to the remote rural areas of Mongolia to see how IFAD and the Government of Mongolia jointly invest to support herders to adapt to extreme weather conditions. He visited the project for Market and Pasture Management Development and cooked with a Mongolian herders' family. The family received training in pasture management, animal breeding, and fodder preparation, and helped them survive the long and harsh winters.</p><p>Reflecting on his visit, Si Kin flagged the urgency to invest in climate action and adaptation. \"I want my grandchildren to inherit a world that works, that is fair and is safe. Climate change it's a global phenomenon; there is no Planet B. The investment you make now is what you will be bequeathing the next generation and your children and grandchildren.\"</p><p>Mongolia's rural populations are very vulnerable to extreme weather events, in particular freezing temperatures up to -40 C, strong winds and heavy snows and ice, but also hot summers and degraded pastureland. The 2024 winter alone led to the death of 7 million animals, representing 13 per cent of animals in the country, and pushed herders' families to migrate to cities. In Mongolia, livestock outnumbers people by around 20 to 1, and about one third of the population are pastoral herders.</p><p>Through the IFAD project, herder families benefited from veterinarian services and learned to better manage pastures. This led to pasture preservation, higher animal productivity and better animal health and survival during the winter. The construction and rehabilitation of fodder and hay storage enabled farmers to better feed their herd during the winter months. An early warning system was established to alert farmers of the arrival of bad weather and so that they could shelter their cattle in time.</p><p>Many agricultural techniques exist for small-scale farmers and herders to build their resilience and adapt to climate shocks. But investments are often lacking to answer their needs.</p><p>According to IFAD estimates, small-scale farmers in developing countries need an additional US$75 billion annually in investments to adapt to a changing climate. Small-scale farmers, cultivating less than two hectares, produce 35% of the world's food and a significant part of the food in low- and middle-income countries. Yet, they receive less than one per cent of global climate finance.</p><p>In late May, the World Meteorological Organization forecasted that global average temperatures could rise to almost 2C above pre-industrial levels in the next five years for the first time. It is predicted that crop yields could decrease by a quarter by the end of the century, threatening rural populations' capacity to feed the world.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ifad.org/en/w/news/after-visiting-rural-areas-in-mongolia-si-king-reports-on-urgency-of-climate-adaptation-to-keep-producing-food-in-adverse-conditions\">https://www.ifad.org/en/w/news/after-visiting-rural-areas-in-mongolia-si-king-reports-on-urgency-of-climate-adaptation-to-keep-producing-food-in-adverse-conditions</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>null-9307435 T80MV-MgEd</p>", "publisher": "Targeted News Service", "instances": ["King travelled to Mongolia with the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to cook and film with Mongolian herders, as part of a new episode of its Recipes for Change series, released today.

In their paper, the authors illustrate these decisions using the study of tree frogs as an example.</p><p>One researcher might choose to measure whether the frogs are moving further north, another researcher might examine whether the frogs are moving higher into the breezy tree canopy and a third researcher might explore whether the frogs are shifting their mating season to cooler months. Any one of these studies could fail to detect whether the tree frog species is using a different adaptation strategy, or a combination of strategies.</p><p>Humans, Fredston pointed out, are an example of a species that adapts to climate using a combination of strategies. You might not go outside in the middle of the day when it's really hot, or you might move states if you don't like your climate anymore, she said. And you could do one or the other, or neither or both.</p><p>The authors of the paper, including UC Santa Cruz ecology and evolutionary biologist Malin Pinsky, implore researchers to design studies that can capture multiple climate response strategies. Monte Neate-Clegg, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz and co-author on the paper, has applied this way of thinking to his own research. In a previous study of birds adapting to climate change conducted at UC Los Angeles, Neate-Clegg measured three adaptation strategies: How far various species were shifting their habitat northward, how much they were moving to higher elevations across mountain ranges and whether they were shifting the timing of their breeding season.</p><p>He found that the birds were using a combination of these adaptation strategies, but that the breeding season shift accounted for two-thirds of their overall adaptation. Had Neate-Clegg only studied the birds' spatial strategies, he would have missed a majority of the animals' approach to surviving climate change.</p><p>This more holistic approach tells us their overall ability to track climate change and emphasizes which aspects of climate tracking are potentially easier for different species, Neate-Clegg said.</p><p>Understanding the most important adaptation strategy for a species can help shape conservation efforts, Neate-Clegg said. For example, if a species seeking cooler temperatures is more likely to move up in altitude rather than further north, conservationists can maximize their efforts to help that species find a home further off the ground.</p><p>We can target conservation towards that particular strategy, Neate-Clegg said.</p><p>A new approach to research</p><p>In addition to pointing out the pitfalls of current research methods, the authors introduce a number of ways scientists can broaden their studies to account for multiple adaptation strategies. One suggestion is to expand annual surveys to occur multiple times per year, allowing researchers to detect how species may be changing their seasonal behavior. The authors also suggest that researchers studying species shifting their habitats across large geographic regions could also measure changes in altitude and depth within those regions.</p><p>Given that expanding the scope of a research study can require additional time and money, the authors suggest making it easier to combine observations from multiple studies. This will require scientists to publish their data with sufficient documentation so that other researchers can easily merge multiple datasets. Researchers could use more sophisticated analysis methods in order to glean findings from these expansive datasets, including machine learning and artificial intelligence tools.</p><p>Supplementing observational research with findings from experimental studies can determine the adaptation strategies species are likely to use with a higher degree of accuracy.</p><p>This paper aims to build on existing research by proposing a more comprehensive approach to studying species on the move, Fredston explained.

While scientific innovations and global partnerships remain central pillars of climate adaptation, one of Africa's most valuable yet often under-recognised tools lies within its cultural heritage: indigenous knowledge.Rooted in centuries of interaction with nature, indigenous knowledge systems have long helped African communities predict weather patterns, manage natural resources, and respond to ecological disruptions. Although sometimes sidelined in formal policymaking, these time-tested practices offer invaluable insights into sustainable living that complement today's climate adaptation efforts.In Kenya's Kitui and Machakos counties, traditional water harvesting methods such as sand dams and terraced catchments continue to support semi-arid communities in conserving scarce rainfall. Though enhanced and expanded through collaborations between local communities and NGOs over recent decades, these systems build upon longstanding indigenous principles of water conservation. </p><p>They trap water during the rainy season and store it for months of dry weather, supporting domestic needs, livestock, and irrigation in ways that blend ancestral wisdom with modern hydrological knowledge.While agroecological methods like intercropping hold promise for improving ecosystem services, including some degree of soil carbon sequestration, the scale and consistency of carbon storage vary considerably depending on local conditions and management.Beyond farming, indigenous communities have historically been custodians of Africa's rich ecosystems. In Tanzania's Ngorongoro Highlands, the Maasai practice rotational grazing by moving cattle seasonally between pastures to prevent overgrazing and promote rangeland regeneration. However, changes in land tenure, conservation policies, and settlement patterns are reshaping these systems, sometimes constraining their effectiveness.The Batwa people of Uganda and Rwanda, once forest dwellers with deep spiritual connections to their environment, have faced forced evictions from ancestral lands to create protected areas. This displacement has limited their ability to apply traditional forest stewardship practices, underscoring the complex tensions between conservation and indigenous rights.Recognising the critical role of indigenous peoples in ecosystem management, some African countries are working to protect community land rights and integrate indigenous governance into conservation frameworks. For instance, Kenya's Forest Conservation and Management Act promotes community involvement. However, implementation remains a work in progress as indigenous groups seek genuine recognition and influence in forest stewardship.Bridging indigenous knowledge and modern science is increasingly seen as essential for effective climate adaptation. Collaborations between meteorologists and local elders, who use traditional environmental indicators such as bird migrations and flowering cycles, enrich climate models and seasonal forecasts. These synergies, while still emerging in many regions, have improved management of water resources, reforestation efforts, and fire control strategies.Despite their potential, structural barriers continue to marginalise indigenous voices in climate discourse. Indigenous knowledge is frequently dismissed as anecdotal or unscientific in policy arenas. Language differences, land dispossession, and limited legal protections further hinder the inclusion of traditional knowledge holders, even though many have accumulated multigenerational observations of rainfall and ecological patterns not captured by satellite data.To fully harness indigenous knowledge, Africa must adopt inclusive climate strategies that value traditional wisdom on par with scientific innovation. This requires involving indigenous leaders in national adaptation planning, funding community-led initiatives, and embedding cultural perspectives into education and climate research.The African Union's 2022 Green Recovery Action Plan marks a promising step by advocating for the integration of local knowledge into resilience-building measures. Likewise, the United Nations' Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform provides a global forum for indigenous voices to influence climate policy, presenting a model that African countries can tailor and expand.While technological innovation and financial resources are vital, true resilience will emerge only when solutions are grounded in the lived experiences of those who have weathered droughts, floods, and famines for generations. This recognition ensures indigenous knowledge rightfully earns a seat at the climate table.jwmbuthia@ke.nationmedia.com </p>", "publisher": "Daily Nation (Kenya)", "instances": ["As climate change accelerates across the African continent, there is an urgent need to diversify strategies that can build resilience in communities.

Three platforms, one ecosystem  Named 'CropLocator', 'SinkEvaluator' and 'SinkMonitor', the three proprietary platforms claim to address the gaps in agriculture, climate adaptation, and voluntary carbon markets by integrating modules.</p><p><br/> CropLocator has reached pilot-ready status, while SinkEvaluator and SinkMonitor are in advanced development and prototyping stages, respectively.  CropLocator analyses 2,000 zones and 300,000 plant species  CropLocator has analysed over 100 environmental parameters across 2,000 agro-ecological zones and 300,000 plant species to provide actionable land-use insights for institutional stakeholders, including seed companies, commodity firms, agribusinesses, research institutions, and government agencies.  SinkEvaluator and SinkMonitor support carbon credit markets  While 'SinkEvaluator' enables rigorous, species- and location-specific modelling of CO\u2082 sequestration, covering 180 tree species at launch and scaling to over 500, supporting credible issuance of carbon credits.<br/> The third platform, 'SinkMonitor', will deliver satellite, drone, and IoT-based monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) to ensure transparency and reliability of carbon assets, enabling participation from insurers, banks, and carbon registries.  Target users: Institutions, not individuals  The platforms are targeted primarily at institutional users rather than individual farmers, serving stakeholders across agriculture, carbon project development, research, and finance.  Zoom in anywhere with high-resolution crop prediction  Basu claims the precision of CropLocator allows users to zoom in anywhere on Earth with a spatial resolution of 9 \u00d7 9 kilometres (each grid cell covering ~81 sq kms) and analyse over 2,000 agro-ecological zones identified by SBSF's segmentation algorithms.<br/> Drawing from a database of more than 300,000 plant species and over a hundred different environmental parameters, it can extract insights on varieties and agronomic practices across comparable zones worldwide.  Founders bring agriculture and data science expertise  \"For organisations shaping agricultural supply chains or planning rural development, this creates a level of clarity that has never been possible before,\" Basu claimed.<br/> While Basu is a PhD in plant molecular genetics and biotechnology from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom and an MBA from the same university, her husband S\u00e9bastien brings over 20 years of experience in data management, statistical modelling, and product development.<br/> With a background as an astrophysics professor and data scientist, S\u00e9bastien has held executive roles in data across global industries for the past decade.  The question that launched the platforms  Both the husband-wife duo started on the journey to build the three platforms with a simple question in mind: how can we tell the world and the people who need it which is the best place to grow a crop - or, in other words, which part of the world is best suited to grow a particular crop?<br/>\"For decades, that question has been answered with a mix of tradition, intuition, and fragmented studies. But agriculture today is no longer operating in a predictable environment. Climate change is altering rainfall and temperature patterns. Soils are under stress. And supply chains are increasingly vulnerable, disrupted not only by biotic and abiotic stresses, but also by geopolitical instability and shifting global trade. In such a world, relying on outdated assumptions is too risky,\" Basu said, asserting that SBSF Agritech's CropLocator along with the other two platforms is poised to change that.<br/>Global rollout planned over three years  She said CropLocator will launch for multiple geographies including India, Southeast Asia, the EU, and the US, with expansion to East Africa and Latin America by the end of year three, while engagement models and end users will vary by region to reflect local needs and priorities.<br/> The underlying technology combines machine learning (ML) for agro-ecological zoning, physiological growth and carbon modelling, and cloud-native MRV infrastructure.  Experts cautious until commercial rollout  \"On paper this concept looks promising but I won't be able to comment on the efficacy until and unless it is commercialised and put into practical usage,\" a senior agriculture expert who didn't wish to be named said.  Self-funded and now looking to raise $8 million  All components of the platforms have been internally developed and self-funded since 2021, forming proprietary intellectual property.<br/> Basu said that SBSF Agritech estimates a $1.4 billion-plus market opportunity for SaaS and API-based access to its platform.<br/> The company is raising $8 million over three years and plans to scale up the funding to execute its plans.  Supporting climate adaptation through data-driven platforms  \"By the third year, the platform aims to support 50-plus carbon projects, on-board over 100 institutional users, and generate US$4 million in annual SaaS or API revenue,\" she added.<br/> She said that the platforms seek land-use efficiency, reduce scope one and three emissions, enhance climate adaptation, and enable high-integrity nature-based carbon credit markets.<br/> By integrating land-use intelligence, carbon modelling, and MRV (measurement, reporting and verification), SBSF Agritech offers a globally scalable solution for governments, financial institutions, project developers, research institutions, and commercial agribusinesses seeking credible climate action and sustainable land management.</p>", "publisher": "Business Standard (Online)", "instances": ["A new tech platform could perhaps provide some answers.

According to news reporting from Harare, Zimbabwe, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"In the face of unprecedented climate change, adaptation has emerged as important for communities and nations to deal with the devastating effects of the phenomenon.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Wellcome Trust. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Zimbabwe: \"It is inevitable that communities must adapt, although evidence in several regions, including Zimbabwe also point towards maladaptation. A plethora of studies have been developed to understand adaptation practices and processes, including the impacts of various adaptive strategies. However, this approach has been limited to particular fields such as livelihoods studies, with clear evidence in Zimbabwe that heath issues vis-a-vis adaptation outcomes have not been taken into consideration at policy, development and research levels. Our study is therefore breaking new research frontiers by exploring the nexus between adaptation strategies and psychosocial and nutritional health outcomes. As an important learning research process into a field where virtually no literature exists in the country, the results are both complex and intriguing.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This qualitative study shows positive nutrition benefits such as improved dietary diversity and boost in self -esteem and, improved stress level over food availability as psychosocial health benefits.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Narratives of climate adaptation and linkages to psychosocial and nutritional health in a Zimbabwean rural community.
