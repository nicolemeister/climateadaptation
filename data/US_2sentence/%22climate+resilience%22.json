This guide was written to help property owners identify the climate risks their buildings may face and what they can do about it. Sea level rise is one of the key climate change effects addressed in the guide. Historic buildings can respond to sea level rise in a variety of ways. One of the most common is dry floodproofing. Dry floodproofing encourages the installation of flood shields and deployable barriers at ground and below grade openings. Brackets are installed (ideally through masonry joints) so that during a major coastal storm event the shields and barriers can be installed, establishing a boundary against rising waters. Though effective, this measure can cause increased pressure on the exterior walls of a building resulting in structural damage. This is thus not a one size fits all solution. An alternative to dry floodproofing is wet floodproofing. Here, spaces below the design flood elevation - the height of the lowest occupiable floor - are designed such that water can flow in and out of the space. Mechanicals and other items in the space should be elevated, moved to different levels of the building (such as on the roof) or designed to function after being submerged in water. This method allows for equal water pressure on both the inside and outside of the building which may help to prevent structural damage.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.boston.gov/news/climate-resilience-citys-historic-districts\">https://www.boston.gov/news/climate-resilience-citys-historic-districts</url>)</p><p>(News Release; Media Release; Announcement; Press Briefing; Remarks; Congressional Documents; Court Order; Court Judgement; Judgment; Court Opinion; Federal Government; Local Government; State Government; Speech; Transcript, Notice, Notification) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p>", "publisher": "US States News", "instances": ["BOSTON, Mass. , Sept.

This is the attitude that is required of the government, especially as the effects of climate change include a worsening of weather conditions, which means, among other things, that monsoonal floods will be worse, and as bad as this year's floods have been, coming years will see a repetition. This is likely to be the new normal with which the government will have to contend. Speaking very roughly, with a monsoon extending roughly from mid-July to the end of October, The time for preparation is thus about eight months, with about four months of execution. Of course, some preparations are only possible in the light of weather forecasts, and while it is now possible to give broad brushstrokes, the kind of forecasts needed for proper planning cannot be achieved without forecasts which will only be available much later in the year.</p><p>While talking about this year's floods, which are not yet over, Mr Sharif was emphatic that those affected be given relief and rehabilitation, and also issued special directions that the federal government should support the provincial governments in their relief and rehabilitation efforts. Indeed, as the governments cannot very well be expected to stop the floods, the relief and rehabilitation efforts are where the government is best able to intervene. Mr Sharif's direction that preparations for next year's monsoon start is a clear indication that he thought this year's effort has fallen short. That has been a constant complaint the whole season of citizens, and a couple of dramatic incidents, where there was not enough warning given, has merely made matters worse.</p><p>One of the most regrettable aspects to emerge is that the rehabilitation of the victims of the 2023 floods has not been completed. Another thing that has been highlighted has been the building of residential societies in flood plains. Apart from penalizing those who gave these societies permission, how those societies are to be shifted and where, must be a priority. The annual ritual of clearing the gutters in urban areas must be replaced by proper urban waste management, which would prevent such scenes as those witnessed this season in Karachi especially. The government should also advocate for climate justice internationally.

This month, the City of Boston will be hosting the second annual Deployables Day, a citywide training exercise on temporary flood protection in recognition of National Preparedness Month</p><p>In 2018, in collaboration with the Environment Department, the City issued a Resilient, Historic Buildings Design Guide. This guide was written to help property owners identify the climate risks their buildings may face and what they can do about it. Sea level rise is one of the key climate change effects addressed in the guide. Historic buildings can respond to sea level rise in a variety of ways. One of the most common is dry floodproofing. Dry floodproofing encourages the installation of flood shields and deployable barriers at ground and below grade openings. Brackets are installed (ideally through masonry joints) so that during a major coastal storm event the shields and barriers can be installed, establishing a boundary against rising waters. Though effective, this measure can cause increased pressure on the exterior walls of a building resulting in structural damage. This is thus not a one size fits all solution. An alternative to dry floodproofing is wet floodproofing. Here, spaces below the design flood elevation - the height of the lowest occupiable floor - are designed such that water can flow in and out of the space. Mechanicals and other items in the space should be elevated, moved to different levels of the building (such as on the roof) or designed to function after being submerged in water. This method allows for equal water pressure on both the inside and outside of the building which may help to prevent structural damage.</p><p>As the risk of flooding resulting from rising sea levels continues to increase, the City's historic districts are beginning to respond. In November 2024 the Bay Village Historic District Commission updated its standards and criteria, which regulate how properties can be modified in the historic district while maintaining their character. Some of the updates directly addressed the risk of flooding. The installation of temporary, deployable barriers in anticipation of a storm event does not require any review. Properties in the district located in the Sea Level Rise - Flood Hazard Area are able to alter their entryways to manage the effects of flooding. After assessing the possibility of elevating interior floors property owners can work with the Commission to design an elevated entry that is compatible with the style and period of the existing building and the overall character of the historic district.</p><p>The Fort Point Channel Landmark District has the highest flood risk of all of the City's historic districts. Here, the implementation of flood</p><p>mitigation strategies has begun. All around the district, especially at openings along the first and ground floors of buildings along the Fort Point Channel, you can see the installation of metal brackets used to secure flood shields and deployable barriers during major coastal storm events. At 51 Melcher Street, the building recently underwent a conversion into a life science laboratory. During the conversion, the project team implemented various resiliency strategies such as consolidating utility rooms within the basement and adopting dry floodproofing measures to protect equipment. Additionally, they raised ground-level mechanicals, retrofitted the foundation from the interior at critical points to reduce water infiltration, and installed brackets for deployable flood shields at ground-level openings.</p><p>This crucial work in Bay Village and Fort Point Channel is just the beginning.

Their knowledge systems, rooted in stewardship, interdependence and care for all life, have guided - and continue to guide - communities through environmental change for millennia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across the world, Indigenous Peoples are responding to climate impacts with ingenuity and foresight. Grounded in lived experience and sustained through generations, Indigenous ways of living are diverse, adaptive, relational and deeply ecological, connected to land and culture. These are dynamic frameworks for resilience.</p><p>As ambition under the Paris Agreement accelerates - in particular through the Global Goal on Adaptation - Indigenous Peoples are increasingly recognized not just as participants in climate policymaking, but as pathfinders. Their distinct and diverse worldviews offer valuable insights into what it truly means to be adapted: living in harmony with ecosystems, upholding intergenerational responsibility, and restoring balance.</p><p>Indigenous Climate Leadership in Action</p><p>Across diverse geographies, Indigenous Peoples are leading the way:</p><p>* Vancouver Island, Canada: The Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation declared 100% of their territory under \"Hishuk Ish Tsawaak\" (ecosystem-based forest management), blending ancestral stewardship laws with modern conservation to protect salmon streams, old-growth forests and watersheds - strengthening carbon sinks and food security.</p><p>* Murray-Darling Basin, Australia: The Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations have reasserted customary governance over key river systems. Through inter-tribal cooperation, they negotiate water allocations, monitor river health, and restore wetlands to sustain ecosystems and downstream communities.</p><p>Highlands of Mongolia: Indigenous herder councils partnered with national meteorological services to co-design the Advanced Weather Information System, combining traditional forecasts with satellite data to issue drought and snow-melt warnings, reducing livestock loss and economic shocks.</p><p>* Mindanao, Philippines: Panlaoy, an Indigenous youth network, is reviving ancestral \"kaingin\" forestry practices, such as contour planting, sacred grove protection and community-based forest monitoring to slow erosion, recharge springs and regenerate degraded upland watersheds, securing downstream water for rice farming.</p><p>These are not isolated examples. They demonstrate that Indigenous-led climate action is happening, quietly and effectively, but is often under-recognized and under-supported. These examples reflect how place-based knowledge systems - whether managing forests, rivers, rains or soils - are being actively revitalized and scaled through partnerships with governments and research institutions. These systems are not only surviving; they are thriving and evolving.</p><p>In mitigation, too, Indigenous Peoples play a central role. Their stewardship of forests, wetlands and grasslands helps maintain vital carbon sinks and protects biodiversity. Studies show that Indigenous-managed lands have lower deforestation rates and greater ecological integrity than surrounding areas.

The devastating floods of 2022 cost Pakistan nearly 5 percent of its GDP, claimed over 1,700 lives, and displaced almost 8 million people. The monsoon rains of 2025 have once again displaced families, disrupted industries, and caused over 660 deaths, nearly 935 injuries, with more than 200 still missing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These disasters show that climate change is not waiting for us. While Pakistan contributes less than one percent of global emissions, it ranks among the most climate-vulnerable countries. This paradox - that those least responsible are most affected - underscores why urgent, collaborative action is essential.</p><p>It has been observed that the private sector, particularly OICCI member companies, have made remarkable strides in embracing sustainability. Across industries, businesses are reducing carbon footprints, investing in renewable energy, adopting water and waste management systems, and building resilient supply chains. These companies are proving that profitability and sustainability can go hand in hand. By embedding resilience into their operations, they are safeguarding both their businesses and Pakistan's future.</p><p>The government, with support from development partners and donor agencies, has also taken important steps. Initiatives like the Delta Blue Carbon project and Recharge Pakistan show how restoring ecosystems can buffer climate shocks while sequestering carbon. Yet, these efforts remain limited in scale. What we need now is faster, deeper, and more collaborative action.</p><p>The recently launched OICCI 3rd Pakistan Climate Conference (PCC) report, based on the outcomes of the 3rd PCC held in January 2025, highlights both achievements and gaps. It identifies policy and financing barriers that continue to slow progress and calls for a shift from fragmented projects to a coordinated long-term strategy. To achieve real impact, Pakistan must unite government, business, development partners, climate experts and other key stakeholders around shared goals and measurable outcomes. Collaboration is the key to Pakistan's resilience.</p><p>One critical area is climate finance. Pakistan faces an annual financing gap of $40-50 billion to address its climate needs. This cannot be bridged domestically. Global instruments exist - green bonds, sukuks, ESG-linked loans, and climate funds - but Pakistan must strengthen credibility to access them. Transparent ESG reporting aligned with international standards, a centralized emissions and ESG data portal, and stronger governance are vital for investor confidence. Without these, the door to climate finance will remain half open.</p><p>Policy reforms must also prioritize renewable energy integration. The power sector is one of Pakistan's largest sources of emissions and inefficiencies. OICCI has consistently advocated for reforms such as power wheeling regulations and smart green grids, enabling industries to procure renewable energy directly. These measures cut costs, lower emissions, and boost export competitiveness. With the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) taking effect, industries must decarbonize quickly or risk losing key markets.</p><p>Innovation and partnerships are equally vital. Public-private partnerships must expand into disaster preparedness, regenerative agriculture, circular economy solutions, and community-based adaptation. The success of Delta Blue Carbon shows what can be achieved when trust and collaboration converge. These models must now be scaled and replicated across sectors for real transformation.</p><p>As highlighted during the launch of the OICCI PCC report, Scope 3 emissions are the real hotspot, often exceeding 70 percent of a company's carbon footprint. Tackling them requires collaboration across supply chains, science-based targets, and transparent reporting aligned with global standards such as IFRS S1/S2.</p><p>Trusted data, skilled people, and systemic reforms are essential to unlocking sustainable finance. Pakistan is macro-bankable, but to convert finance into real resilience, we must better utilize existing budgets, attract blended capital, and channel funds into people-centered initiatives in energy, agriculture, circularity, and risk reduction.</p><p>Pakistan must also strengthen its voice in international climate negotiations. As the world prepares for COP30 in Brazil, we should approach not as petitioners but as equal partners. Pakistan must shift from a vulnerability narrative to one of investable opportunities, with its NDC serving as an investment map, showing where resources can flow and what outcomes they can deliver.</p><p>By leveraging niches such as Islamic finance and disaster-resilience solutions, and by cutting emissions while reducing costs across supply chains, Pakistan can ensure its exports remain competitive in a decarbonizing global market. This is how we move from asking for help to offering partnerships.</p><p>The private sector must be actively engaged in shaping national strategies, including NDC 3.0, so that a united and ambitious national voice will give Pakistan a stronger claim to climate finance, technology transfer, and global partnerships.</p><p>When reflecting on these challenges and opportunities, one truth stands out:</p><p>Pakistan's path to resilience cannot be walked alone. Climate change does not recognize boundaries between government and business, or between one sector and another. Its impacts are shared, and so must be our response. For the private sector, this means investing in sustainable practices and reporting transparently.</p><p>For the government, it means enabling policies and accountability. For development partners, it means aligning support with Pakistan's long-term priorities. For all of us, it means committing to a vision where climate resilience and sustainable growth go hand in hand.</p><p>The stakes could not be higher. Pakistan's economy, its food and water security, its energy systems, and the well-being of its people all depend on the choices we make today. Despite the enormity of the challenge, there is reason for hope. The determination of OICCI members, the willingness of the government to engage, and growing public awareness suggest that the seeds of transformation have already been planted. What is needed is the collective will to nurture them into lasting change.</p><p>The measure of success will not be the number of reports written or conferences held, but the resilience of our communities, the sustainability of our industries, and the confidence of future generations that Pakistan can thrive in a changing climate. We owe it to ourselves, and to them, to act boldly, collaborate deeply, and sustain our efforts over the long term. Only then can we turn the tide on climate vulnerability and build a nation that is resilient - and prosperous - for generations to come.</p>", "publisher": "Business Recorder", "instances": ["For the government, it means enabling policies and accountability.

Urey Yarkpawolo, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), outlined Liberia's national approach to addressing the growing climate crisis, emphasizing both the continent's vulnerability and its proactive leadership.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his remarks, Dr. Yarkpawolo highlighted the stark contrast between Africa's minimal contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions and the disproportionate impact it endures from climate change. He pointed out that Liberia, like many African nations, is already grappling with the devastating effects of climate disruptions. These include increasing sea erosion that is displacing entire communities along the coast, unpredictable rainfall patterns that are undermining food security and agricultural productivity, and more frequent and intense storms that continue to disrupt livelihoods and critical infrastructure.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Dr. Yarkpawolo made it clear that Liberia is not approaching climate change from a position of helplessness. Instead, the country is actively developing and implementing a comprehensive resilience strategy centered on integrity, equity, and sustainability. He outlined several pillars of Liberia's climate response.</p><p>One major focus is on carbon markets, where Liberia is in the final stages of developing a National Carbon Market Policy and an Article 6 framework. These initiatives are designed to attract climate finance and green investment while ensuring that all efforts maintain transparency and deliver equitable benefits to local communities. The goal, according to Dr. Yarkpawolo, is to engage the global carbon market without compromising environmental integrity or marginalizing vulnerable populations.</p><p>Another area of emphasis is the protection and restoration of Liberia's natural ecosystems. The country is actively working to rehabilitate its mangroves and wetlands, ecosystems that serve as natural buffers against climate-related events such as flooding and storm surges. At the same time, Liberia is implementing coastal protection programs to defend its shoreline and support both biodiversity and the emerging blue economy, which relies on the sustainable use of ocean and water-based resources.</p><p>Enforcement of environmental laws is also a critical component of Liberia's approach. Dr. Yarkpawolo noted that the EPA, under Liberia's Environmental Protection and Management Law, is taking action against illegal mining activities and mercury pollution, which pose significant threats to both human health and the environment.</p><p>He stressed that these enforcement efforts are being carried out alongside initiatives aimed at ensuring just transitions, meaning that affected communities are being supported with sustainable alternatives that offer long-term economic and social benefits.</p><p>In the area of clean and renewable energy, Liberia is pushing forward with the implementation of its new Net Metering Policy. This policy is facilitating the installation of solar energy systems in key public facilities, including health centers and government buildings. These systems are intended to enhance energy security and ensure that essential services remain operational during extreme weather events, thereby strengthening the country's overall climate resilience.</p><p>Dr. Yarkpawolo used the platform to reaffirm Liberia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which outlines a target of reducing national emissions by up to 64 percent by 2030, contingent upon international support.</p><p>He called on development partners and global climate financiers to fulfill their commitments, particularly through the capitalization of the Loss and Damage Fund. He also stressed the importance of making adaptation finance more accessible to African institutions and expressed strong support for initiatives like the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which seeks to preserve tropical forests as a global climate mitigation asset.</p><p>Concluding his remarks, Dr. Yarkpawolo challenged the prevailing narrative that often portrays Africa solely as a victim of climate change. He stated that while the continent is indeed vulnerable, it is also home to innovative and determined actors who are building resilient systems.</p><p>He urged international stakeholders to recognize Africa's efforts and invest in the continent's climate transition, asserting that such investments are essential to securing a safer and more stable climate future for the entire world.</p>", "publisher": "AllAfrica News Wire (English)", "instances": ["Representing the country at the High-Level Ministerial Meeting, Dr. Emmanuel K.", "In the area of clean and renewable energy, Liberia is pushing forward with the implementation of its new Net Metering Policy.

Urey Yarkpawolo, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), outlined Liberia's national approach to addressing the growing climate crisis, emphasizing both the continent's vulnerability and its proactive leadership.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his remarks, Dr. Yarkpawolo highlighted the stark contrast between Africa's minimal contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions and the disproportionate impact it endures from climate change. He pointed out that Liberia, like many African nations, is already grappling with the devastating effects of climate disruptions. These include increasing sea erosion that is displacing entire communities along the coast, unpredictable rainfall patterns that are undermining food security and agricultural productivity, and more frequent and intense storms that continue to disrupt livelihoods and critical infrastructure.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Dr. Yarkpawolo made it clear that Liberia is not approaching climate change from a position of helplessness. Instead, the country is actively developing and implementing a comprehensive resilience strategy centered on integrity, equity, and sustainability. He outlined several pillars of Liberia's climate response.</p><p>One major focus is on carbon markets, where Liberia is in the final stages of developing a National Carbon Market Policy and an Article 6 framework. These initiatives are designed to attract climate finance and green investment while ensuring that all efforts maintain transparency and deliver equitable benefits to local communities. The goal, according to Dr. Yarkpawolo, is to engage the global carbon market without compromising environmental integrity or marginalizing vulnerable populations.</p><p>Another area of emphasis is the protection and restoration of Liberia's natural ecosystems. The country is actively working to rehabilitate its mangroves and wetlands, ecosystems that serve as natural buffers against climate-related events such as flooding and storm surges. At the same time, Liberia is implementing coastal protection programs to defend its shoreline and support both biodiversity and the emerging blue economy, which relies on the sustainable use of ocean and water-based resources.</p><p>Enforcement of environmental laws is also a critical component of Liberia's approach. Dr. Yarkpawolo noted that the EPA, under Liberia's Environmental Protection and Management Law, is taking action against illegal mining activities and mercury pollution, which pose significant threats to both human health and the environment.</p><p>He stressed that these enforcement efforts are being carried out alongside initiatives aimed at ensuring just transitions, meaning that affected communities are being supported with sustainable alternatives that offer long-term economic and social benefits.</p><p>In the area of clean and renewable energy, Liberia is pushing forward with the implementation of its new Net Metering Policy. This policy is facilitating the installation of solar energy systems in key public facilities, including health centers and government buildings. These systems are intended to enhance energy security and ensure that essential services remain operational during extreme weather events, thereby strengthening the country's overall climate resilience.</p><p>Dr. Yarkpawolo used the platform to reaffirm Liberia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which outlines a target of reducing national emissions by up to 64 percent by 2030, contingent upon international support.</p><p>He called on development partners and global climate financiers to fulfill their commitments, particularly through the capitalization of the Loss and Damage Fund. He also stressed the importance of making adaptation finance more accessible to African institutions and expressed strong support for initiatives like the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which seeks to preserve tropical forests as a global climate mitigation asset.</p><p>Concluding his remarks, Dr. Yarkpawolo challenged the prevailing narrative that often portrays Africa solely as a victim of climate change. He stated that while the continent is indeed vulnerable, it is also home to innovative and determined actors who are building resilient systems.</p><p>He urged international stakeholders to recognize Africa's efforts and invest in the continent's climate transition, asserting that such investments are essential to securing a safer and more stable climate future for the entire world.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Frontpage Africa.

It constructs a composite index framework for evaluating the green business environment (GBE) and urban climate resilience (UCR) using the entropy weight method. Employing a two-way fixed-effect regression model, it examined the impact of GBE optimization on UCR empirically and also explored the underlying mechanisms. The results show that improvements in the GBE significantly enhance UCR, with green innovation (GI) in technology functioning as an intermediary mechanism within this relationship. Moreover, climate policy uncertainty (CPU) exerts a moderating effect along this transmission pathway: on the one hand, it amplifies the beneficial effect of the GBE on GI; on the other hand, it hampers the transformation of GI into improved GBEs. The former effect dominates, indicating that optimizing the GBE becomes particularly critical for enhancing UCR under high CPU. To eliminate potential endogenous issues, this paper adopts a two-stage regression model based on the instrumental variable method (2SLS). The above conclusion still holds after undergoing a series of robustness tests. This study reveals the mechanism by which a GBE enhances its growth through GI. By incorporating CPU as a heterogeneous factor, the findings suggest that governments should balance policy incentives with environmental regulations in climate resilience governance.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Furthermore, maintaining awareness of the risks stemming from climate policy volatility is of critical importance.

In developing countries, where vulnerability to climate impacts is often highest, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a powerful tool for climate action and enhancing societal resilience. While presenting its own set of challenges, it offers unique opportunities to adapt, mitigate and build a more sustainable future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"AI, if developed and deployed responsibly, can become a powerful force for good, helping us to achieve our sustainability goals, promote ethical practices, and build a more just and equitable society for all, especially in the realm of climate change and its consequences for the world,\" I shared during my presentation on \"AI Technology Developments: Its Impact on Sustai\\xACnability and Ethics\" at the first-ever Cebu Supply Link Conference held in Cebu City recently.</p><p>No longer a futuristic concept, AI actively contributes to the fight against climate change with real-world applications demonstrating its potential to empower vulnerable nations. As I said, \"Most critical for many developing nations is AI's increasingly important role in disaster risk reduction and climate resilience, which means early warning systems to predict typhoons. Al also creates algorithms to better determine how disaster may unfold.\"</p><p>AI-driven solutions are invaluable in enhancing early warning systems. Developing countries face a disproportio\\xAC nate share of climate-related disasters; traditional forecasting methods often lack the precision and speed needed to effectively prepare for extreme weather events. AI, however, can analyze vast amounts of weather data, satellite imagery and historical records to generate more accurate and timely forecasts of hurricanes, floods and droughts. This advanced capability empowers communities to take proactive measures: evacuating at-risk areas, securing infrastructure and mobilizing emergency resources, ultimately saving lives and minimizing damages.</p><p>Another critical area where AI is making a difference is urban resilience. In many developing countries, rapid urbanization outpaces infrastructure's ability to adapt to changing climate conditions, leaving many areas prone to climate-induced disasters. Here, AI systems can assess building footprints, material types and structural conditions using high-resolution aerial imagery. By automating the creation of detailed risk maps, AI enables cities to prioritize interventions and strengthen infrastructure. Authorities can identify buildings that are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes or floods and take steps to reinforce or relocate them.</p><p>AI offers transformative solutions for agriculture, a sector particularly vulne\\xACrable to climate change. Shif\\xAC ting wea\\xACther patterns, prolonged droughts and increased pest infestations threaten food security, especially in developing countries where many communities rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. AI helps optimize planting schedules, monitor crop health and predict pest outbreaks, which is essential for ensuring food security in the face of changing climate conditions. By analyzing soil conditions, weather forecasts and crop data, AI algorithms can provide farmers with personalized recommendations on planting times, irrigation strategies and pest control measures. This type of precision agriculture increases yields and reduces the need for water, fertilizers and pesticides, minimizing farming practices' environmental impact.</p><p>Recognizing risks</p><p>Beyond adaptation, AI plays an increasingly important role in mitigating and helping countries take more effective measures to combat climate change, through its application to the critical act of monitoring GHG emissions. Satellites identify gas emissions over various areas. Predicting potential leaks based on historical data patterns is transforming methane management strategies, equipping governments and industries to address these emissions before they escalate.</p><p>Yet, as I shared, \"The power of AI is not without its perils. If left unchecked, it could exacerbate existing inequalities, create new forms of bias, and even accelerate environmental degradation.\" As AI becomes more widespread, we must also recognize the risks related to gender bias and social inequities. AI systems, if not designed inclusively, can unintentionally perpetuate existing biases and social inequities in climate action.</p><p>They are highly energy-intensive, especially those powered by deep learning and large language models. While these technologies offer unprecedented capabilities, they also consume significant amounts of electricity; they can strain overburdened energy grids in developing countries and exacerbate carbon emissions if the electri\\xACcity is generated from fossil fuels.</p><p>To fully harness AI's potential for climate action, it is essential to integrate these technologies into national climate strategies. Governments must create a supportive ecosystem that encou\\xACrages innovation, fosters collaboration, and ensures equitable access to AI tools and resources. International partnerships play a vital role in provi\\xACding technical assistance, financial support and knowledge sharing.</p><p>AI is a critical tool for climate action and building resilience in developing countries.

Presented at WBR's Bicycle Mobility and Impact Forum in Lusaka, the analysis builds on two landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Zambia, confirming that bicycles not only generate exceptional economic and social returns but also enable households to sustain and grow their livelihoods through times of crisis. The RCT evidence highlights the multidimensional benefits of bicycles\u2014advancing education, strengthening healthcare access, and improving household resilience\u2014particularly for women.</p><p><br/><br/>During Zambia's 2024 drought, households with bicycles were less food insecure, maintained incomes, and preserved key assets such as livestock, while control households experienced declines and sold off productive assets. Bicycle recipients spent more time on farms, reached farther markets, maintained more nutritious diets, and continued to access essential services such as water, schools, and healthcare. Bicycle owners gained approximately one hour per day for productive activities. <br/><br/>The 2024 RCT, sampling households in Mumbwa District, Zambia, established clear gains in income, productivity, and access to essential services. Findings from WBR's 2018 RCT in the Southern Province generated evidence on the impact of bicycles on attendance, punctuality, and empowerment. Now, the cost-effectiveness analysis provides fresh evidence of the return on investment of bicycles in the sectors of health, education, and economic opportunity.<br/><br/>Exceptional ROI: Bicycles deliver a 14.7x return on investment (ROI) of the cost of the bicycle. Households receiving bicycles generated an average of $3,188 in economic benefits over five years\u2014driving higher consumption, greater savings, and fewer debts.<br/><br/>Education Impact: Providing bicycles to girls in primary schools increases school attendance by 17 days each year, per $100 invested.<br/><br/>Healthcare Reach: Providing bicycles to community-based volunteers through the Mobilized Communities program enables CHWs to serve 5,774 additional clients over five years per bicycle distributed.<br/><br/>\"These findings confirm that bicycles are not only transformative for rural livelihoods, but also among the most cost-effective development interventions we've studied,\" said Kashif Ahmed, Junior Economist at IDinsight. \"A nearly 15-to-1 return on investment places bicycles alongside the most impactful anti-poverty programs, delivering lasting social and economic benefits at a fraction of the cost. For policymakers and funders seeking scalable, evidence-based approaches, bicycles represent a proven, high-value solution.\"<br/><br/>Beatrice's Story: Doubling Income, Strengthening Community<br/><br/>In Chipa Village, Mumbwa District, Headwoman Beatrice can testify firsthand how a Buffalo Bicycle transforms both leadership and livelihood. Previously, she spent about $6 each week on transport just to cover the 20 kilometers required to attend meetings at the palace. With her new bicycle, those journeys cost nothing\u2014and the savings have fueled growth in her small grocery store and tomato garden. In just one year, her household income has doubled from $175 to $350 per month, a 50% increase, by using the bicycle to transport fresh produce to market and restock her shop. Beyond her own success, the bicycle has become a lifeline for her community: family and neighbors borrow it to reach the health center when unwell, extending the impact far beyond one household. Beatrice's story captures how bicycles reduce barriers, unlock opportunity, and strengthen resilience across entire communities.<br/><br/>Cross-Country Validation<br/><br/>Beyond Zambia, monitoring data from Malawi, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Colombia showed similar or even greater income gains, confirming that World Bicycle Relief's Mobilized Communities model is relevant across geographies and cultures. This growing body of evidence underscores that the economic and resilience benefits of bicycles are not unique to one setting, but consistently replicated around the world.<br/><br/>\"Resilience is about more than surviving a drought \u2014 it's about sustaining livelihoods, protecting families' assets, and enabling communities to thrive in the long term,\" said Sean Granville-Ross, Executive Director of Programs at World Bicycle Relief. \"These findings prove that bicycles are a powerful, climate-friendly tool for resilience in rural communities.\"<br/><br/>20th Anniversary Milestone<br/><br/>This report comes as WBR marks its 20th anniversary as a global nonprofit organization.

This approach uniquely combined regional-level data with five types of indicators: farming practices, water, climate/soil, biodiversity, and economics. Focus groups were instrumental in the process of gathering, selecting, and fine-tuning indicators, identifying gaps, and areas where policies should be tailored and targeted.

The hydrological and diffuse pollution parameters were calibrated using SWAT-CUP (2011-2017) to better reflect localized land use and environmental conditions. Under future climate conditions, water provision is expected to increase; however, surface runoff is likely to dominate during the wet season, exacerbating both soil erosion and nutrient loading. The R4 region, characterized by intensive agricultural and urban land use, is projected to experience the greatest decline in WES, with nearly 70 % of subwatersheds falling below an index score of 0.5, and approximately 10 % falling below 0.3. High concentrations of agricultural and urban land use further intensify flood risks and impair water quality.
