Recent studies show regenerative farming practices can improve income by up to 20% to 30%2.<br/>The Rainforest Alliance has integrated these principles into its Regenerative Agriculture Standard, providing farmers with a science-based certification pathway for measuring progress and outcomes across five impact areas : soil health and fertility, climate resilience, biodiversity, water stewardship, and livelihoods. By implementing these practices effectively, coffee producers can build more productive and resilient farms while unlocking new market opportunities through certification. Independent auditors periodically visit farms and companies to check that they are meeting the requirements of the standard. When they do, they are awarded certification-and only then may they display the Rainforest Alliance regenerative seal on their products.<br/>For companies, sourcing Rainforest Alliance Certified Regenerative coffee represents a strategic investment in producers who are better positioned to withstand climate shocks and contribute to more resilient, high-performing supply chains. It also enables brands to make stronger claims based on credible data, strengthen their ESG performance, and meet growing consumer expectations with a trusted Regenerative Agriculture seal that means real impact. In turn, coffee drinkers can make more informed buying decisions and feel confident that their choices will support both farmers and the planet.<br/>The Regenerative Agriculture Standard is already being implemented across coffee farms in Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Meanwhile, companies sourcing from these farms are gearing up to deliver their first Rainforest Alliance Certified Regenerative coffee products to store shelves in 2026.<br/>The Rainforest Alliance invites farmers and companies to start their regenerative journey. Explore the requirements for Regenerative Agriculture Certification and start preparing for implementation today.<br/>About the Rainforest Alliance<br/>The Rainforest Alliance, an international non-profit organization, works to restore the balance between people and nature for both to thrive in harmony.

This achievement far exceeds the 20% target set for 2025, demonstrating the growing adoption of regenerative agriculture among coffee farmers, according to the latest Nescaf 2030 Plan progress report.</p><p>Nescaf supports coffee farmers in their transition to practices such as optimizing fertilizer use, ground cover, mulching, and composting, with the aim of improving productivity while reducing costs. Adopting these practices also contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to coffee farming. By 2024, NESCAF Plan participants will have reduced their GHG emissions by 20% to 40% per kilogram of green coffee.[]</p><p>The effects of climate change have been severely felt in the coffee sector for several years, with many producing countries facing adverse weather conditions. This has led to a decline in the availability of green coffee and a surge in global prices for Arabica and Robusta coffee, highlighting the urgent need to strengthen the resilience of supply chains.</p><p>Axel Touzet, head of Nestl's coffee brand strategy unit, said:</p><p>\"Regenerative agriculture is at the heart of the NESCAF Plan and our efforts to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain. This third report shows that coffee farmers are increasingly aware of the benefits of these practices, as evidenced by their growing adoption. This encourages us to continue our work with our supplier-producer partners in the regions where we source our coffee.\"</p><p>With age, coffee trees naturally become less productive and more susceptible to the effects of climate change, which can further reduce yields. Plantation renovation and renewal are therefore essential. In 2024, the NESCAF Plan continued its coffee seedling distribution program, with 21 million plants distributed to improve yields and adapt to climate change.</p><p>The NESCAF Plan currently covers over 400,000 hectares of cultivated coffee land. By 2024, over 1,400 field agents and agronomists had trained over 200,000 coffee farmers in regenerative agriculture practices across 16 countries. These experts actively support producers on issues such as soil erosion, organic matter management, and optimized fertilization.</p><p>This year's report highlights the work carried out with two partners: the Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and TechnoServe.</p><p>Coffee production is an economic activity, and coffee farmers must make informed decisions about varieties, investments, and inputs. Nescaf is collaborating with GIZ to strengthen farmers' entrepreneurial skills.

This competitiveness is going to be relevant because of the new forms of economic relations that now apply.

Another important factor highlighted by Martins is the demonstration of the model for producers to understand.<br/>\"Farmers will adopt it when the cost is favorable, they will adopt it when they try it and see that it works. The producer will adopt it as soon as he realizes that not only does it improve his performance from the point of view of earning, but it also improves performance from the point of view of the system,\" he said.<br/>According to Martins, these changes will mean that agricultural money will start circulating in the production area itself. \"When we calculate the capital involved in the soy chain, that 60%, which is the money from the soy chain that goes to multinationals, will start circulating in the production regions. It means circulating money, jobs and the productive structure to meet farmers' needs. There is no more important change, from a social and economic point of view, a change like this,\" he said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regenerative tropical agriculture</emphasis><br/>The president also commented on the creation of a document to define the concept of regenerative tropical agriculture. He also stressed the importance of public policies for Brazil to have its own agriculture and consequently deliver much more in terms of productivity.<br/>\"We need to take care of this for two reasons. Firstly, to show that we have something of our own, we're going to have a great opportunity to have our own agriculture.

In some cases, RA often also includes broader efforts to balance environmental, economic, and social welfare principles. The term regenerative in the context of agricultural practices first appeared in the early 1980s and was mainly associated with organic production practices. Regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) combines RA with organic production practices. ROA is often cited as building on RA practices and sometimes used interchangeably with RA. Since the mid-2010s, research and advocacy focused on RA and ROA have increased sharply.</p><p>Despite the growing popularity of RA and ROA labeling and marketing claims, neither term has been formally codified in either federal or state statutes or regulations. There also is no widely accepted consensus about how to define these terms. Regenerative farming principles have not been formally identified and are not enforceable under existing federal programs or certification standards subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Despite a lack of consensus about how to define regenerative and the absence of federal enforceable certification standards, several food companies and retailers have adopted policies to label and market some food products as regenerative or as regenerative organic based on criteria developed under private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives.</p><p>Uncertainty about what is meant by RA and ROA and how to interpret marketing claims about foods labeled as regenerative compared with other sustainable product claims may create challenges for farmers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers. While there are no statutory, regulatory, or formal administrative definitions of RA and ROA, many of the soil-related practices incorporated into private sector initiatives are consistent with soil health principles recommended by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). These NRCS conservation practice standards often share with the organic agriculture sector the common goal of optimizing soil health but differ from USDA National Organic Program regulations and federal certification standards that prohibit certain practices and external inputs for products labeled organic (such as the use of certain synthetic chemicals, sewage sludge, and biotechnology). USDA has administered climate and carbon sequestration initiatives that share some practices and goals with private RA and ROA initiatives. Regardless of what practices are required under various private sector initiatives, federal labeling requirements and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, such as those under the authorities of FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, still apply.</p><p>Congress has debated regenerative farming and its potential role in improving soil biodiversity, fertility, and structure or achieving other goals. Congress has conducted hearings on RA, and some Members have introduced bills and resolutions involving RA and ROA, although few bills have attempted to define either term. In the 118th Congress, H.R. 598 would have identified 32 different farming conservation practices considered to be regenerative agricultural practices, or other practices as determined by the USDA Secretary. H.R. 9631 included a definition of regeneratively produced agricultural products and a definition of regeneratively-organically produced agricultural products based on USDA-certified organic production methods. In the 117th Congress, H.Res. 1234 referred to RA as a \"system of farming and ranching principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches the soil, and purifies watersheds, all while increasing in-farm fertility.</p><p>\" H.Res. 1234 also</p><p>expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services\" and resolved to \"support and fund programs that provide resources to agricultural scientists and other public interest scientists to work with farmers to identify innovations, the replicability of regenerative practices, and sustainable and resilient systems.\" To date, Congress has not enacted legislation defining RA or ROA, and no introduced legislation has proposed to establish a federal regulatory framework to oversee marketing claims of foods labeled as regenerative or produced using regenerative agricultural practices.</p><p>Congress may continue to discuss a next farm bill, and whether to establish federal definitions of RA and/or ROA could be a topic of interest. Congress may consider whether to incorporate farming practices considered to be regenerative into existing USDA conservation standards and product marketing schemes and whether to establish a federal regulatory framework to oversee marketing claims for food products labeled as regenerative. The 119th Congress may also consider related legislative efforts, such as promotion of regenerative farming principles by the Make America Healthy Again congressional caucus, which has a stated goal of \"advancing regenerative and precision agriculture and environmental efforts.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Contents</p><p>Terms and Definitions ... 2</p><p>Absence of Uniform RA and ROA Definitions ... 2</p><p>Early Efforts to Define Regenerative Farming ... 4</p><p>Process-Based and Outcome-Based Definitions ... 6</p><p>Claimed Benefits and Criticism ... 8</p><p>Federal, State, and International Activities ... 10</p><p>Congressional Legislative Examples ... 10</p><p>State Government Example ... 11</p><p>International Examples ... 12</p><p>Private Sector Activities ... 13</p><p>Efforts to Substantiate Nonfederal Labeling Claims ... 13</p><p>Selected Industry Initiatives ... 14</p><p>Federal and Private Sector Shared Criteria ... 17</p><p>USDANRCS National Conservation Practice Standards ... 17</p><p>Climate and Carbon Sequestration Initiatives ... 19</p><p>USDA National Organic Program Standards ... 20</p><p>Federal Food Product Labeling Requirements ... 22</p><p>Considerations for Congress ... 24</p><p>Possible Farm Bill Reauthorization ... 24</p><p>Make America Healthy Again Efforts ... 25</p><p>Tables</p><p>Table 1.

The term regenerative in the context of agricultural practices first appeared in the early 1980s associated mainly with organic agricultural practices. Accordingly, regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) combines RA with organic production practices.</p><p>Among food manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, interest is increasing in RA and ROA as well as other related sustainable consumer product labeling and marketing claims. Some policymakers also have shown interest in regenerative farming as a way to potentially improve (i.e., regenerate) soil biodiversity, fertility, and structure, among other environmental and societal goals. For example, H.Res. 1234 (117th Congress) expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services.\" Congress has conducted hearings on RA, although few bills have attempted to define regenerative or promote the term's use. Some policymakers have expressed concern about efforts to advance RA, when related objectives (e.g., use of certain pesticides and chemicals in food production) could result in limited options for agricultural production practices./1</p><p>To date, RA and ROA have not been defined in statute, and regenerative farming principles are not enforceable under existing federal or state programs or policies. There also are no federal or state certification standards or rules for what can be defined as RA or ROA practices subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)./2</p><p>There also is no clear scientific definition of or agreement on the types of farming practices and product standards that might qualify as regenerative. This lack of consensus complicates the ability of food producers, manufacturers, and retailers to make certain labeling and marketing claims about food products. In contrast, the term organically produced agricultural product has a federally recognized and enforced statutory definition, and USDA administers an organic certification program./3</p><p>Food companies and retailers have adopted policies to label and market some food products as regenerative or as regenerative organic based on criteria developed under various private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives. Definitions and marketing claims under these initiatives vary, depending on the food product sold and the specific goals and objectives of the group promoting the initiative. Some RA and ROA initiatives are broadly focused on certain minimally applied production practices, and others are highly prescriptive and specify wide-ranging and explicit practices intended to achieve certain production and environmental outcomes. Some initiatives include a wide range of social welfare outcomes, such as assurances of farmer profitability and minimum salaries and benefits for workers, promotion of locally sourced foods, and considerations of Indigenous agricultural practices and animal welfare protections. Aside from general labeling requirements and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, private sector efforts are not verifiable or enforceable by federal or state rules. Farmers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers may find it challenging to navigate uncertainty about what is meant by RA and ROA and how to interpret marketing claims on foods labeled as regenerative compared with other sustainable food product claims.</p><p>* * *</p><p>1 U.S. Congress, House Committee on Agriculture, Past Breakthroughs and Future Innovations in Crop Production, hearing, 119th Cong., 1st sess., July 22, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=\">https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=</url> 118519.</p><p>2 Since the start of the second Trump Administration, both the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have announced reorganization and restructuring plans.

In addition, there is no widely accepted consensus about how to define these terms. Currently, companies that label or market foods as regenerative are likely participating in various private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives. Foods labeled and marketed as regenerative under these initiatives are not certified or governed by any federal or state program, although some private sector initiatives may include regenerative practices and outcomes outlined in some federal programs and policies, such as standards and requirements comprising some USDA conservation and. organic certification programs, along with a focus on efforts to balance environmental, social, and economic principles. In addition, federal laws and regulations govern the labeling and marketing of food products to ensure foods sold in the United States are properly labeled and are not misbranded; however, current federal guidance does not specifically address \"regenerative\" food product labeling claims./5</p><p>USDA scientists note that RA \"seems to be defined differently by different people\" and that most definitions are \"based on the goal of regenerating soil\" and largely include practices that are \"in line with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)'s soil health principles\" and share a common goal with organic agriculture (i.e., optimizing soil health)./6</p><p>NRCS conservation practices include minimizing tillage, maximizing the amount of time roots are growing in soil, and adding organic amendments to soil (e.g., manures, crop and cover crop residues)./7</p><p>NRCS conservation practice standards are broadly applicable to most conventionally produced agriculture and may differ from those under USDA-certified organic agriculture regulations that prohibit certain practices and external inputs (such as the use of synthetic chemicals, sewage sludge, and biotechnology). Some researchers define RA according to NRCS principles: \"keeping soils continuously covered, minimizing soil disturbance, increasing biological diversity, keeping living roots in the soil, and integrating livestock\" to ensure soil health and carbon sequestration and reduce inputs while \"not sacrificing profitability.\"/8</p><p>* * *</p><p>4 See Sen.

In practice, they acknowledge that the regenerative label \"has been applied to nearly anything that improves farm outcomes and minimizes environmental impact.\"/9</p><p>This includes common agricultural and soil health practices intended to boost crop yields, mitigate production risks, improve soil conditions, increase input efficiency, reduce synthetic inputs, support new crop development, or enable new or alternative revenue streams (e.g., carbon credits or products marketed as organic or locally produced). The text box above illustrates some of the farming practices that may be considered to be regenerative.</p><p>ROA initiatives generally include RA farming practices (see text box above) as a base requirement that is supplemented by organic agricultural practices and standards. While some ROA initiatives require practices and standards under USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) regulations and federal certification process,/10 ROA initiatives, in most cases, reference practices associated with various private sector organic certification programs. Accordingly, ROA initiatives may include practices related to soil health, animal welfare, and social equity, among other practices, including planting perennials, developing pollinator and wildlife habitats, incorporating agroforestry systems, planting vegetative barriers, and implementing practices that may develop soil organic matter. The Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) notes that the leading regenerative practices cited by existing initiatives are reduced tillage, integration of livestock, use of cover crops and crop rotation systems, and low to no application of external inputs (such as chemicals and biotechnology). According to OFRF, current initiatives' leading desired outcomes include improved soil health and fertility, increased carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and improved water health and economic well-being of communities. OFRF claims that the aim of minimizing external inputs while maximizing ecological practices is captured in the principles of organic agriculture./11</p><p>Ambiguity about what is meant by RA and ROA has made it difficult to develop legislation on this topic and has raised concerns about potential misleading or deceptive claims related to the sustainability and environmental benefits of a product or practice claiming to be regenerative./12</p><p>Despite the lack of clarity, some food companies and retailers continue to incorporate sustainability and regenerative initiatives into their global supply chains.</p><p>* * *</p><p>9 Shane Thomas, \"If Every Company Is a Regenerative Ag Company, Then No Company Is a Regenerative Ag Company,\" Upstream Ag Insights, May 10, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://upstream.ag/p/if-every-company-is-a-regenerative-agcompany-then-no-company-is-a-regenerative-ag-company-4bcb8c340\">https://upstream.ag/p/if-every-company-is-a-regenerative-agcompany-then-no-company-is-a-regenerative-ag-company-4bcb8c340</url>.</p><p>10 The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 was enacted as part of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-624, Title XXI; 7 U.S.C.

Most researchers cite the Rodale Institute - a nonprofit organization that supports organic farming research, practices, and education - as among the first to formally coin the phrase \"regenerative agriculture\" in the early 1980s. Others cite earlier work by the National Association of Conservation Districts (NACD) and other groups./13</p><p>Some acknowledge general contributions in the early 20th century by soil scientist George Washington Carver of Tuskegee University,/14 among other pioneers of sustainable, organic, and alternative agriculture./15</p><p>Overall, regenerative farming has become one among several terms used to describe farming systems that seek to balance agricultural production with environmental goals./16</p><p>The following definition of RA is attributed to Robert Rodale of the Rodale Institute in 1983:/17</p><p>'Regenerative agriculture is one that, at increasing levels of productivity, increases our land and soil biological production base. It has a high level of built-in economic and biological stability. It has minimal to no impact on the environment beyond the farm or field boundaries. It produces foodstuffs free from biocides. It provides for the productive contribution of increasingly large numbers of people during a transition to minimal reliance on non-renewable resources.'</p><p>Historically, the Rodale Institute promoted regenerative farming as creating a \"permanently sustainable system,\" mainly through the use of organic farming and \"nonmainstream\" farming methods./18</p><p>This included \"avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides\" in exchange for \"more natural fertilizers and totally biological approaches to insect control,\" as well as growing a mixture of annual and perennial wild plants instead of monocropping annual crops, thus reducing the need for tillage and weed control. Similarly, NACD's promotion of regenerative farming cited efforts to \"slow the advance of desertification and soil salinization, reduce the loss of prime farmlands and fragile topsoils,\" support wildlife habitats, and reduce waste and water contamination, as well as \"in general, make rural America a far more healthy, satisfying, and financially rewarding place to live.\"/19</p><p>The Rodale Institute also has advocated for adding \"regenerative components to the present [farming] system in a bit-by-bit way.\"/20</p><p>* * *</p><p>13 R.

Most current ROA-recommended practices tend to be associated with private organic certification programs rather than with federal NOP certification standards and policies. These private sector programs may include practices similar to those required under NOP (e.g., cover cropping, crop rotation, low- to no-till farming, composting, and reduced use of persistent chemical pesticides and fertilizers), but they often include additional practices related to soil health, animal welfare, and social equity. In private programs, soil health practices (such as the development of soil organic matter) may include, for example, the \"addition of perennials, development of pollinator and wildlife habitats, incorporation of agroforestry systems, [and] vegetative barriers,\" among other practices./21</p><p>In 1985, Rodale defined ROA as a practice that \"improves the resources it uses, rather than destroying or depleting them\" and as a \"holistic systems approach to agriculture that encourages continual on-farm innovation for environmental, social, economic and spiritual wellbeing.\"/22 ROA was said to be distinct from sustainable agriculture since it \"takes advantage of the natural tendencies of ecosystems to regenerate when disturbed\"; is \"marked by tendencies towards closed nutrient loops, greater diversity in the biological community, fewer annuals and more perennials, and greater reliance on internal rather than external resources\"; and is \"aligned with forms of agroecology practiced by farmers concerned with food sovereignty the world over.\"/23</p><p>Unlike RA and ROA, sustainable agriculture is defined in statute for the purposes of USDA program implementation (see the text box below). Although this term is defined in statute, multiple interpretations of sustainability are used to market food products and there is limited federal guidance regarding sustainable food labeling and packaging claims.</p><p>Process-Based and Outcome-Based Definitions</p><p>While research and initiatives focused on RA and ROA have increased since the mid-2010s, the meaning of each term varies depending on the group defining, certifying, and promoting such product claims. How RA and ROA are defined has led to tension./24 In general, such definitions vary depending on whether labeling a product as regenerative is determined by the use of specific farming practices (i.e., process-based) or certain desired goals (i.e., outcome-based) or both./25</p><p>* * *</p><p>21 Regenerative Organic Alliance, \"Why RegenerativeOrganic?,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenorganic.org/why-regenerative-organic/\">https://regenorganic.org/why-regenerative-organic/</url>.</p><p>22 USDA's National Agricultural Library (NAL), oral history interview with Robert Rodale in 1989, available at Rodale Institute, \"Regenerative Organic Agriculture: Beyond Sustainable,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/</url>.</p><p>23 Rodale Institute, Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change, 2014, <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/wpcontent/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/wpcontent/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf</url>.</p><p>24 Janet Ranganathan et al., \"Regenerative Agriculture: Good for Soil Health, but Limited Potential to Mitigate Climate Change,\" World Resources Institute, May 12, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soilhealth-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change;\">https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soilhealth-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change;</url> David Bronner, \"Regenerative Agriculture: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" All-One Blog, Dr. Bronner's, March 11, 2024, <url normalizedValue=\"https://info.drbronner.com/all-one-blog/2024/03/regenerativeagriculture-good-bad-ugly/;\">https://info.drbronner.com/all-one-blog/2024/03/regenerativeagriculture-good-bad-ugly/;</url> and Keith Paustian et al., Climate Mitigation Potential of Regenerative Agriculture Is Significant!, Regenerative Agriculture Foundation, June 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document\">https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document</url>.</p><p>25 See, for example, Peter Newton et al., \"What Is Regenerative Agriculture?

Process-based RA (or ROA) definitions may explicitly exclude certain practices, such as those that negatively impact soil health and biodiversity as well as those that use synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, biotechnology, intensive tillage, monocropping, concentrated animal feeding systems, or soilless production systems (e.g., hydroponic and aquaponic). Overall, a process-based RA definition is based on an actual or perceived relationship between a process and a particular outcome./28</p><p>In contrast, examples of outcome-based RA definitions may include claims such as enhanced soil health (e.g., regarding structure, organic matter, and fertility); improved ecosystem function (e.g., water quality and pasture quality); increased biodiversity; carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; improved farm productivity (e.g., better crop yields and crop resilience) and profitability; reduced waste; improved human health (e.g., food safety, access, and nutritional quality); and improved animal health and welfare, among other social or community well-being benefits./29 In general, outcome-based RA is accepting of all of the processes that lead to a desired outcome; if the approach includes multiple outcomes, then any process used would have to contribute to (or at least not hinder) the accomplishment of all outcomes./30</p><p>Claimed Benefits and Criticism</p><p>Advocates of RA and ROA claim the benefits of implementing regenerative practices include improved soil quality and resilience, sequestration of carbon in soil, climate change mitigation, improved crop yields and ecosystem services, reduced runoff and subsequent soil and water resource degradation, minimized pesticide residues and exposure, reduced energy use, improved biodiversity conservation, and enhanced food security./31 In addition to environmental benefits, other research suggests possible benefits include enhanced food nutritional quality and improved human health as well as food availability and affordability if food is produced locally./32 Other research claims economic and social benefits, including improved farmer profitability from reduced input costs, risk mitigation, and higher output value; enhanced local food production; food security; and employment./33 Although regenerative farming is generally more labor-intensive than conventional farming, the labor costs might be offset by lower input costs elsewhere, such as reduced agrochemical and energy inputs and possible higher farm income.</p><p>* * *</p><p>28 Some studies have examined outcomes using combined (or stacked) practices based on different growing or geographic conditions.

In the 118th Congress, H.R. 598 identified 32 different farming conservation practices considered to be regenerative agricultural practices, or \"any other highly effective and evidence-based vegetative or management practice, as determined by the Secretary, based on an annual review, that significantly reduces agricultural greenhouse gas emissions or assists producers in adapting to, or mitigating against, increasing weather volatility.\" Practices identified in H.R. 598 were part of broader efforts to address climate-related concerns.</p><p>Another 118th Congress bill, H.R. 9631, included a definition of regeneratively produced agricultural products - those that use an \"integrated approach to farming and ranching rooted in the principles of soil health leading to improved target outcomes\" and \"in a manner that fosters community and social wellness.\" H.R. 9631 also included a definition of regeneratively-organically produced agricultural products as those that also meet additional requirements and production methods described in the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.6501 et seq.). H.R. 9631 proposed these definitions for the purposes of establishing a Food as Medicine program promoting foods that are regeneratively produced, organically produced, or both.</p><p>Committees in the 117th Congress conducted a series of hearings on RA in 2022./40 Also in the 117th Congress, H.Res. 1234 would have expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services\" and resolved to \"support and fund programs that provide resources to agricultural scientists and other public interest scientists to work with farmers to identify innovations, the replicability of regenerative practices, and sustainable and resilient systems.\" H.Res. 1234 referred to RA as a \"system of farming and ranching principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches the soil, and purifies watersheds, all while increasing in-farm fertility.\" H.Res. 1234 claimed \"regenerative practices and sustainable agriculture works to restore ecosystems, combat climate change, build soil health, prevent erosion, and improve water quality,\" among other benefits.</p><p>Other introduced legislation would have amended USDA conservation programs to include RA but did not specifically define RA-related terms or practices. For example, in the 118th Congress, H.R. 5951/S. 3023 suggested that, at minimum, RA training would cover conservation practices that \"improve soil health, reduce production inputs, and regenerate soil, farmland, and nearby ecosystems,\" as well as organic and diversified practices (such as perennial cropping systems, agroforestry or silvopasture systems, livestock integration into cropping systems, and prescribed grazing) and practices that mitigate climate impacts and draw on \"traditional ecological knowledge\" from various producer groups.</p><p>State Government Example</p><p>In January 2025, the California State Board of Food and Agriculture (CSBFA) finalized its recommendations to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) on defining RA for the purpose of the state's agricultural policies and programs./41 See the text box below.</p><p>* * *</p><p>40 See, for example, U.S. Congress, House Committee on Agriculture, \"Soil Health Practices and Programs that Support Regenerative Agriculture,\" hearing, 117th Cong., 2nd sess., September 14, 2022, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/LC69492/text;\">https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/LC69492/text;</url> and U.S. Congress, House Oversight and Reform Committee, Subcommittee on Environment, \"Regenerative Agriculture: How Farmers and Ranchers are Essential to Solving Climate Change and Increasing Food Production,\" hearing, 117th Cong., 2nd sess., July 19, 2022, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/115012\">https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/115012</url>.

The proposed definition is intended as \"continuous implementation of practices that over time minimize inputs and environmental impacts and further enhances the ecosystem while maintaining or improving productivity, economic contributions and community benefits.\" This approach is said to have been informed \"by the traditions and innovations from the original Indigenous stewards of the land.\" The definition is not intended for use in certification.</p><p>Source: CDFA, Staff Draft: Defining Regenerative Agriculture for State Policies and Programs. The proposed draft definition references policies and practices at USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service; the California Department of Pesticide Regulation; and various University of California research initiatives. AB-1757 refers to Assembly Bill 1757 (California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006).</p><p>* * *</p><p>CSBFA's recommendations incorporate certain RA-related target outcomes found in state and federal sustainability strategies, including in CDFA's Healthy Soils Program, USDA conservation standards, and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation's sustainable pest management efforts. CDFA's definition does not include organic certification as a base requirement to qualify as regenerative, despite related efforts to increase transition from conventional to organic agriculture in the state./42 To date, these recommendations have not been codified in state law. No other state government has initiated similar efforts to officially define RA or ROA.</p><p>International Examples</p><p>Sustainable agriculture and RA topics are being debated and examined within a variety of international forums and intergovernmental organizations, including the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p><p>The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has set broad sustainability goals since the 1970s, resulting in efforts to address sustainable agriculture and resilient agroecosystems. Some earlier efforts encompassed objectives spanning ethics and fairness, resource protections, biodiversity, economic viability, rural and socioeconomic development, and social responsibility./43 Decades later, these topics continue to be debated. For example, sustainable and regenerative production were topics at the 2023 Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its subsidiary agreement, the Paris Agreement./44 Among other outcomes, COP28 identified a target related to food and food systems involving the need for \"implementation of integrated, multi-sectoral solutions, such as land use management, sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems\" and \"attain[ment of] climate-resilient food and agricultural production and supply and distribution of food, as well as increas[ed] sustainable and regenerative production and equitable access to adequate food and nutrition for all\" by the year 2030./45 The COP28 decision on the Paris Agreement's global goal on adaptation sets an identical 2030 target./46 Although RA has been said to be closely aligned with the UNSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that seek to \"promote sustainable agriculture\" (SDG-2),/47 the term is not explicitly referenced in the SDGs.</p><p>WTO's 1995 Agreement on Agriculture does not reference sustainable agriculture or RA but includes multiple references to agro-environmental issues. These include the need to protect the environment, support research and infrastructural works associated with environmental programs, and make allowances for \"special treatment reflecting factors of non-trade concerns, such as food security and environmental protection,\" including payments to agricultural producers that are \"part of a clearly-defined government environmental or conservation program.\"/48 WTO members continue to discuss how to facilitate sustainable agriculture within the global trade system,/49 and industry groups continue to propose ways to incorporate sustainability goals as part of agricultural subsidies subject to WTO commitments and obligations under the agreement./50 Previous multilateral agricultural trade talks, such as those at the WTO 12th Ministerial Conference in 2021-2022, discussed but did not implement possible sustainable trade liberalizations, among other topics./51</p><p>* * *</p><p>42 Rebekah Weber, \"California Creates Guidance for Regenerative Agriculture - A Mixed Bag,\" California Certified Organic Farmers, January 14, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ccof.org/news/california-creates-guidance-for-regenerativeagriculture-a-mixed-bag/;\">https://www.ccof.org/news/california-creates-guidance-for-regenerativeagriculture-a-mixed-bag/;</url> and Brad Hooker, \"In Defining Regenerative Ag, CDFA Ignites Debate over California's Farming Future,\" Agri-Pulse, September 13, 2023.</p><p>43 Heinrich Wohlmeyer and Theodor Quendler, eds., The WTO, Agriculture and Sustainable Development (Routledge, 2017), pp. 244-245, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351282123\">https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351282123</url>.</p><p>44 Conferences of the Parties (COPs) are convened under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a multilateral treaty adopted in 1992, and seek to identify and assess climate measures (see UAE Consensus COP 28 UAE, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cop28.com/en/;\">https://www.cop28.com/en/;</url> and UNFCCC, \"The Paris Agreement,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement</url>).

It also builds soil health and reduces soil loss; reduces farm workers and fence-line communities' exposure to toxic compounds; reduces water and air pollution; increases biodiversity and pollinator health; and makes food more nutritious. Continued use of toxic pesticides and fertilizers on farms hinders each of these regenerative goals.</p><p>\" Hundreds of millions of pounds of pesticides are applied to crops in the U.S. every year to control weeds, insect infestations, and plant diseases. Pesticides directly harm the microorganisms essential to regenerating healthy soil, which is regenerative agriculture's main objective. Similarly, 20.8 million metric tons of fertilizer are used, which harm waterways and air quality,\" said Cailin Dendas, lead author and As You Sow 's environmental health sr. coordinator. \"Labelling programs that rely on massive pesticide and fertilizer use as 'regenerative' misleads investors and consumers, and leaves companies susceptible to claims of greenwashing, creating litigation and reputational risk.\"</p><p>Notably, only 3 companies in the report currently require the reduction of toxic synthetic pesticides in their regenerative agriculture programs. McCain Foods, Lamb Weston, and PepsiCo set high standards for peers to follow not only by reducing pesticide use but by defining regenerative agriculture with clear, outcome-based criteria for their suppliers; tracking and reporting progress on regenerative outcomes; and collaborating with suppliers, researchers, technology developers, farmers, and other stakeholders to advance large-scale adoption. These companies received B and C grades, respectively. Unfortunately, a significant majority of companies earned much lower scores, with an average company grade of \"D.\"</p><p>\"Low company scores shine a light on the food industry's failure to evolve beyond industrial farming,\" said Danielle Fugere, As You Sow 's president and chief counsel. \"Adopting effective regenerative food programs is essential to creating a supply chain resilient to extreme weather events and crop loss, and minimizing the use of toxic synthetic inputs linked to chronic illness and cancer.\"</p><p>\"There's an inherent contradiction in using degenerative practices like reliance on pesticides, while claiming regenerative outcomes,\" said Kendyl Van Dyck, co-author and consultant for As You Sow.</p><p>\"Our agricultural system is at a significant turning point,\" said Dendas, \" environmental degradation too often outweighs the benefits provided by industrial farming. Food companies have the power to regenerate healthy soil and food - a win for farmers, consumers, investors, and the environment - but, instead, too many are taking half measures rather than adopting the full range of core regenerative practices within their supply chains.\"</p><p>As You Sow is the nation's leading shareholder representative, with a 30-year track record promoting environmental and social corporate responsibility.

Texas. Mercury is the nearest named community and also happens to be the closest locality to the geometric center of Texas. From there, the heart of Texas, the father and son team of Jim and Stephen West are working, along with the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), to establish their operation using regenerative farming and management methods.</p><p>Jim, a retired Marine and patriarch of the family, and Stephen, with a college degree in agriculture, enjoy pushing the boundaries of traditional farming practices. Their partnership is more than a business venture, it's a testament to collaboration and core values.</p><p>\u201cWe \u2019 re bringing together different conservation practices to create a regenerative farming system,\u201d said Jim.</p><p>\u201cWe hope to show it \u2019 s possible to naturally grow crops and raise animals through diversity. \u201d</p><p>Their commitment to the process of regenerative farming, along with help from NRCS programs and personnel, is proving to be a winning combination.</p><p>A different approach</p><p>Regenerative agriculture takes a different approach compared to conventional methods.</p><p>Regenerative methods look at how all the parts of the process fit and work together. It looks at the system as a whole, not individual pieces. Its aim is to let natural processes take the lead, with management decisions made to enhance or restore those processes. The use of external inputs, especially synthetic forms, are minimized or eliminated completely.</p><p>\u201cIt \u2019 s this very complex system of nature taking care of nature,\u201d said Jim.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is based on five key principles; keeping the soil covered, increasing diversity, minimizing soil disturbance, maintaining living roots and integrating livestock.</p><p>The Wests look to incorporate these principles in all their decisions.</p><p>From their rotational grazing system, diversity in crops and animals, use of chickens as pest control, and unique fertilizer, they are practicing what they preach.</p><p>Jim began researching regenerative agriculture in the early 2000s while still in military service with the Marine Corp.</p><p>He wanted to understand the chemistry and biology behind it.</p><p>Books, articles, podcasts, videos, he took in all the information he could find. He also began to make his own observations from his travels with the military.</p><p>Having been stationed around the world in places like the Philippines, Korea, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, the experiences piqued his curiosity. Having learned from each one, he was curious as to why certain things worked in some areas and not others.</p><p>\u201cI watched the land here \u2014 not just our place \u2014 because everybody who \u2019 s using land has a vision for what they want to do and I \u2019 m not going to fault their vision,\u201d said Jim. \u201cI think we can do ag a lot better in the US. I just thought, \u2018There \u2019 s got to be a better way. \u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a landowner to come in with plans for regenerative farming and soil health \u2014 is not very common,\u201d said NRCS Brady Resource Team Leader, Haden Keyser. \u201cWhen Jim and Stephen came to me with this idea, the research and knowledge they have on this system gives me hope they are going to be successful. \u201d</p><p>All in the family</p><p>The journey for Sunrise W Land and Cattle began after Jim retired from military service.</p><p>He was able to acquire his grandfather's 600-acre ranch to combine with property he already owned. The move not only honored his family's history but sparked a vision he and Stephen had for their own operation. They were also able to purchase another piece of property just a mile down the road.</p><p>With the land they wanted under their control, all that was left was to install the system they had envisioned.</p><p>Stephen's agricultural knowledge and expertise, coupled with Jim \u2019 s decades of experience and leadership, has created a synergy. This drives innovation and progress on every inch of the property.</p><p>Even the name of the ranch, Sunrise W, has meaning and purpose.</p><p>\u201cW of course, our last name is West,\u201d said Jim. \u201cThe arc on top \u2014 I taught my kids there \u2019 s five C \u2019 s to living a good life: candor, competence, compassion, courage, and core values. If you \u2019 ll notice, there \u2019 s five rays to the sun. And so that became our cattle brand. \u201d</p><p>They are quick to point out a silent partner that plays a significant role as well.</p><p>\u201cMom doesn \u2019 t come out too often. She still works a job in San Antonio,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cBut she \u2019 s our CFO. Everything runs through her. At the end of the day she keeps my dad and I grounded for sure. \u201d</p><p>NRCS Partnership in Restoring the Land</p><p>Initially on their own, the property was so heavily covered in mesquite, that the first two years were spent clearing portions of the land. The invasive brush was removed mechanically, stacked and the piles burned to give them a blank canvas to start from.</p><p>Looking for information about the flood prevention dam on the property, the Wests came to the NRCS office in Brady. The conversation soon turned to conservation and the plan they had in mind. From that starting point, the Wests have worked closely with NRCS.</p><p>Now, the focus is on improving their pastures.</p><p>The Wests have been able to implement conservation practices that complimented their regenerative program.</p><p>The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) has been the main source of NRCS program participation for the Wests.</p><p>EQIP offers technical and financial assistance for working agriculture lands. It helps farmers and ranchers maintain or improve production while conserving natural resources. NRCS works one-on-one with producers to develop a conservation plan that outlines practices and activities to solve on-farm resource issues. EQIP helps make conservation accessible.</p><p>For the Wests, this included practices such as fencing, water development, additional brush clearing and grass seeding. Through EQIP, they have been able to install infrastructure that allows their operation to run smoothly.</p><p>\u201cSo, the NRCS has been one, a great resource of knowledge, then also has been a great resource in getting these projects \u2014 on the ground,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cIt can be very labor intensive when it comes to having to move animals every single day and having the water for them as well. \u201d</p><p>The Wests utilize a management intensive grazing system. In this system, the cattle are concentrated on a small area for a short time. The goal of this system is better grazing utilization, encouraging livestock to eat everything within the grazing area. Livestock are moved often, most times daily. Adequate fencing and water sources make the process easier. The area is then left ungrazed for the remainder of the year, allowing it to rest before it is grazed again the next year.</p><p>NRCS has also been helpful with grass mixes and plantings.</p><p>Both for their regenerative system and grazing rotations, grass is vitally important. All five principles of regenerative agriculture can be tied back to grass, specifically it \u2019 s abundance and diversity. After brush removal and as a way of rejuvenating the soil, the Wests have experimented with many different seed mixes.</p><p>\u201cWe put together a list of seeds and ask what they think,\u201d said Jim. \u201cNRCS has been great in helping us get the right mix. \u201d</p><p>Outside the box</p><p>For regenerative agriculture systems that try and minimize outside inputs, especially synthetic products like insecticides and fertilizers, more natural options are preferred.</p><p>Following their regenerative goals, Jim and Stephen have incorporated practices that aren \u2019 t exactly traditional.</p><p>\u201cThe unique thing about this ranch is the incorporation of worm tea and chickens to help microorganisms and soil health,\u201d said NRCS Brady district conservationist Walt Broyles. \u201cYou typically do not see that on rangeland for our cattle operations. \u201d</p><p>Chickens provide many benefits to the Wests \u2019 program.</p><p>They utilize a mobile coop to house their chickens on pasture. It follows the cattle in rotation through the pastures, 2-3 days behind. The coop houses several hundred Rhode Island Red chickens.</p><p>The chickens fill multiple roles.</p><p>Manure is a natural fertilizer that benefits pasture grasses and is a resource that is abundant in livestock operations. This is especially the case in intensively managed systems like the Wests \u2019 that concentrate animals on smaller acres. The chickens scratch through the cattle manure, spreading it out and making the coverage more uniform. They also eat insects that are attracted to it. By following the cattle closely in rotation, the chickens take care of the insects before they become a problem. This is especially true of flies, which are a common problem for livestock producers.</p><p>They also provide a product that can be sold, eggs.</p><p>Being raised on pasture, input for production is lower and the eggs fetch a premium price being cage-free and organic.</p><p>Worm tea is a practice that is not common but shows promise as a fertilizer alternative.</p><p>Worms perform the important task of decomposition. As they process materials, they return important nutrients back to the soil and boost microbial activity. This in turn benefits other soil microorganisms like bacteria, fungi and protozoa. All of these parts and organisms combined form a healthy, fertile soil.</p><p>\u201cEarthworms are nature \u2019 s way of putting biology back into the soil,\u201d explains Jim, \u201cwhich is exactly what we want. \u201d</p><p>The Wests have taken this beneficial natural process and have adapted into making their own worm tea.Worm tea is made by taking the decomposed materials from worms, called worm castings, adding water, and allowing it to \u201cbrew\u201d. Though this is an oversimplification, the process allows the beneficial microorganisms to reproduce and form a natural liquid fertilizer that is readily absorbed by plants.</p><p>The Wests have a large bin of approximately 100,000 worms that they collect the castings from. The bin is filled with compost and mixed with a blend of grains that is food for the worms. They collect the castings once a week from the bottom of the flow-through bin. From there, the castings go into what the Wests call the brewer. It can best be described as a super-sized Keurig machine. The container is filled with water and aerated for 24 hours, allowing the microorganisms in the castings to multiply. The product at the end of the process is a nutrient and microorganism dense, all-natural fertilizer. They then spray the liquified worm tea onto their pastures.</p><p>\u201cWe have been accused of being odd,\u201d said Stephen with a chuckle.</p><p>All of these conservation measures, both traditional and new, combine to form a regenerative system that is benefitting both the land and the operation.</p><p>A Bright Future Ahead</p><p>Looking ahead, the Wests are hoping their approach can become a model others can learn from and replicate.</p><p>Jim and Stephen are dedicated to sharing their knowledge and experience with fellow landowners. They hold classes, participate in interviews, and create videos to educate and inspire others to embrace regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn \u2019 t trade it. You know, just seeing the difference,\u201d said Jim. \u201cMy ultimate goal is that whoever we deal with believes we \u2019 re providing more nutritious food and that we \u2019 re taking care of both them and the land and animals at the same time. And that \u2019 s really what drives me. \u201d</p><p>Keyser, who calls himself one of the Wests \u2019 biggest fans, is excited to see how their land responds.</p><p>\u201cThey want people to come up to their fence and ask, \u2018What are you doing over there? \u2019 and find success so they can share what they \u2019 re doing. They \u2019 re not afraid to work \u2014 and they believe in this,\u201d said Keyser.</p><p>Broyles, too, admires the Wests \u2019 out-of-the-box approach. \u201cThese systems they have here\u2014it \u2019 s how hard do you want to work? It \u2019 s a daily basis. \u201d</p><p>For the NRCS, \u201cHelping people help the land\u201d is the motto that we strive to achieve with every producer and conservation plan we implement.

The company has pioneered a patented, zero-waste fertilizer technology and established distribution across over a million acres of North American farmland \u2013 achievements that set it apart in a sector long dominated by traditional incumbents. This new facility is more than just an increase in production; it's a proof point that sustainable agriculture innovations can be scaled profitably. \"Beiseker is more than a facility \u2014 it's a blueprint for what comes next,\" Replenish CEO Neil Wiens noted in the company's release, a sentiment we echo at ESGFIRE. We view this successful start-up as a template for Replenish's scalable growth model, with an additional project (DeBolt) in the development pipeline that can replicate this model across new regions. In particular, Replenish's upcoming DeBolt facility in Alberta is planned to produce up to 50,000 tonnes per year of regenerative fertilizer with similar margins and pricing as Beiseker translating into additional potential annual revenues of ~CA$30 million. We anticipate hearing further updates on DeBolt's progress soon, as it represents the next major step in Replenish's expansion strategy. With the global shift toward regenerative farming gaining momentum, Replenish is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on rising demand for environmentally friendly nutrient solutions. The consistent 30%+ margins and field-proven efficacy of its products not only advance sustainable soil health but also demonstrate that green innovations can deliver attractive returns. ESGFIRE also highlights the fact that ReplenishNutrients have a scalability in licensing their plant model to external actors, a feature they are almost unique with in the agtech sector.ReplenishNutrients has proven itself as a flagship ESGFIRE portfolio company by uniting profitability with sustainability. The Beiseker facility's commissioning marks a turning point \u2013 it validates Replenish's ability to execute at scale and generate meaningful cash flow while healing the soil. This accomplishment strengthens our confidence in Replenish's growth trajectory and reaffirms our investment thesis. We believe today's milestone foreshadows significant value creation ahead, as Replenish continues to expand its market reach and set new benchmarks in regenerative agriculture. ESGFIRE remains as optimistic as ever about Replenish's future and we are excited to soon see developments like DeBolt further contribute to its success.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About ESGFIRE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESGFIRE is an investment company and research firm that focuses on ESG companies with either an environmentally friendly service or product.

By working with nature instead of against it, we can reduce pressures on farmers while protecting the land for the next generation,\" stated Nathaniel Barrett, President and CEO of AgriTec. \"Education is just as important as innovation. Our role is to help farmers see what's possible when soil health comes first, and to support them as they put those principles into practice.\"This segment will highlight AgriTec International's remarkable shift from conventional product sales to a strategy centered on nurturing soil health from the ground up. Viewers will learn about innovative liquid soil amendments, biologicals, and fertilizers that work in harmony with nature to promote long-term fertility, rather than just short-term boosts. The program will demonstrate how AgriTec International's emphasis on farmer education and support allows growers to unlock existing nutrients within their soil, leading to robust crops, increased yields, and enhanced profitability, all while safeguarding the land for generations to come. This approach helps farmers navigate critical industry challenges, including the rising costs of traditional inputs and the increasing demand for sustainable practices.</p><p><br/>The focus will be on AgriTec International's \"soil first\" philosophy, illustrating how a deep understanding of soil biology can reduce dependency on synthetic chemicals and foster a more resilient agricultural system. We'll see how working with nature, rather than against it, can unlock the immense potential already present in farmland, leading to a profound impact on both the environment and the farmer's bottom line.

A 2023 analysis from the European Investment Bank estimates that agriculture in the EU has a financing gap of up to 62 billion ($73 billion).

Many food and agriculture companies have set environmental targets for the agricultural products they source and have already established programs offering incentives and technical support to farmers who improve environmental outcomes. They are also motivated by the opportunity to build resilience in their supply chains as extreme weather increasingly threatens food security.</p><p>Agricultural banks offer financing that can support farmers through on-farm investments that occur over time or require substantial capital outlays. They also often have existing, close relationships with their farmer clients and insight into the entirety of farm businesses. They are motivated to support their farmer clients who want to make on-farm investments aligned with market shifts and government targets, including sustainability goals and greenhouse gas emission reductions.</p><p>When these business priorities come together, companies and banks have the opportunity to support farmers by offering holistic financial solutions in which market incentives and financing are packaged and tailored to the regenerative transition. In addition to providing better financial solutions for farmers, collaboration between food companies and agricultural banks will also expand the total amount of transition finance available to farmers. This would be a dramatic improvement to the status quo, in which farmers must try to fit together different incentives and financing that often have incompatible or burdensome requirements.</p><p>Building from examples of success</p><p>Participants in the roundtable shared existing programs and initiatives that could be learned from or expanded with a broader collaborative effort.</p><p>Across Europe, offering interest rate incentives within agricultural loans for sustainable projects is increasingly becoming the norm.

This financing supports the Irish dairy sector a critical economic driver and major source of the country's greenhouse gas emissions to implement climate-friendly practices and technologies.</p><p>Earlier this year, the United Kingdom agricultural bank Oxbury also launched a new loan facility to incentivize and reward farmers to make sustainable changes. The Oxbury Transition Facility operates in conjunction with other financing initiatives, such as government grants and supply chain incentives, to create a blended finance model that extends the impact of multiple partners.</p><p>Additionally, the Swedish alternative finance provider G\u00a5rdskapital was created to help more farmers transition to regenerative practices and offers a variety of tailored financing options.</p><p>Value chain collaboration can drive progress</p><p>To bring financial solutions such as these and others to scale, participants weighed how they can enable greater collaboration between food and agricultural companies and financial institutions.</p><p>One key idea of interest was a blended finance facility at a landscape scale an entity that could help convene finance providers to offer lower interest rates or take on higher-risk projects, and better align with supply chain programs and incentives in a specific region.

In some cases, RA often also includes broader efforts to balance environmental, economic, and social welfare principles. The term regenerative in the context of agricultural practices first appeared in the early 1980s and was mainly associated with organic production practices. Regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) combines RA with organic production practices. ROA is often cited as building on RA practices and sometimes used interchangeably with RA. Since the mid-2010s, research and advocacy focused on RA and ROA have increased sharply.</p><p>Despite the growing popularity of RA and ROA labeling and marketing claims, neither term has been formally codified in either federal or state statutes or regulations. There also is no widely accepted consensus about how to define these terms. Regenerative farming principles have not been formally identified and are not enforceable under existing federal programs or certification standards subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Despite a lack of consensus about how to define regenerative and the absence of federal enforceable certification standards, several food companies and retailers have adopted policies to label and market some food products as regenerative or as regenerative organic based on criteria developed under private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives.</p><p>Uncertainty about what is meant by RA and ROA and how to interpret marketing claims about foods labeled as regenerative compared with other sustainable product claims may create challenges for farmers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers. While there are no statutory, regulatory, or formal administrative definitions of RA and ROA, many of the soil-related practices incorporated into private sector initiatives are consistent with soil health principles recommended by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). These NRCS conservation practice standards often share with the organic agriculture sector the common goal of optimizing soil health but differ from USDA National Organic Program regulations and federal certification standards that prohibit certain practices and external inputs for products labeled organic (such as the use of certain synthetic chemicals, sewage sludge, and biotechnology). USDA has administered climate and carbon sequestration initiatives that share some practices and goals with private RA and ROA initiatives. Regardless of what practices are required under various private sector initiatives, federal labeling requirements and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, such as those under the authorities of FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, still apply.</p><p>Congress has debated regenerative farming and its potential role in improving soil biodiversity, fertility, and structure or achieving other goals. Congress has conducted hearings on RA, and some Members have introduced bills and resolutions involving RA and ROA, although few bills have attempted to define either term. In the 118th Congress, H.R. 598 would have identified 32 different farming conservation practices considered to be regenerative agricultural practices, or other practices as determined by the USDA Secretary. H.R. 9631 included a definition of regeneratively produced agricultural products and a definition of regeneratively-organically produced agricultural products based on USDA-certified organic production methods. In the 117th Congress, H.Res. 1234 referred to RA as a \"system of farming and ranching principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches the soil, and purifies watersheds, all while increasing in-farm fertility.</p><p>\" H.Res. 1234 also</p><p>expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services\" and resolved to \"support and fund programs that provide resources to agricultural scientists and other public interest scientists to work with farmers to identify innovations, the replicability of regenerative practices, and sustainable and resilient systems.\" To date, Congress has not enacted legislation defining RA or ROA, and no introduced legislation has proposed to establish a federal regulatory framework to oversee marketing claims of foods labeled as regenerative or produced using regenerative agricultural practices.</p><p>Congress may continue to discuss a next farm bill, and whether to establish federal definitions of RA and/or ROA could be a topic of interest. Congress may consider whether to incorporate farming practices considered to be regenerative into existing USDA conservation standards and product marketing schemes and whether to establish a federal regulatory framework to oversee marketing claims for food products labeled as regenerative. The 119th Congress may also consider related legislative efforts, such as promotion of regenerative farming principles by the Make America Healthy Again congressional caucus, which has a stated goal of \"advancing regenerative and precision agriculture and environmental efforts.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Contents</p><p>Terms and Definitions ... 2</p><p>Absence of Uniform RA and ROA Definitions ... 2</p><p>Early Efforts to Define Regenerative Farming ... 4</p><p>Process-Based and Outcome-Based Definitions ... 6</p><p>Claimed Benefits and Criticism ... 8</p><p>Federal, State, and International Activities ... 10</p><p>Congressional Legislative Examples ... 10</p><p>State Government Example ... 11</p><p>International Examples ... 12</p><p>Private Sector Activities ... 13</p><p>Efforts to Substantiate Nonfederal Labeling Claims ... 13</p><p>Selected Industry Initiatives ... 14</p><p>Federal and Private Sector Shared Criteria ... 17</p><p>USDANRCS National Conservation Practice Standards ... 17</p><p>Climate and Carbon Sequestration Initiatives ... 19</p><p>USDA National Organic Program Standards ... 20</p><p>Federal Food Product Labeling Requirements ... 22</p><p>Considerations for Congress ... 24</p><p>Possible Farm Bill Reauthorization ... 24</p><p>Make America Healthy Again Efforts ... 25</p><p>Tables</p><p>Table 1.

For example, H.Res. 1234 (117th Congress) expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services.\" Congress has conducted hearings on RA, although few bills have attempted to define regenerative or promote the term's use. Some policymakers have expressed concern about efforts to advance RA, when related objectives (e.g., use of certain pesticides and chemicals in food production) could result in limited options for agricultural production practices./1</p><p>To date, RA and ROA have not been defined in statute, and regenerative farming principles are not enforceable under existing federal or state programs or policies. There also are no federal or state certification standards or rules for what can be defined as RA or ROA practices subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)./2</p><p>There also is no clear scientific definition of or agreement on the types of farming practices and product standards that might qualify as regenerative. This lack of consensus complicates the ability of food producers, manufacturers, and retailers to make certain labeling and marketing claims about food products. In contrast, the term organically produced agricultural product has a federally recognized and enforced statutory definition, and USDA administers an organic certification program./3</p><p>Food companies and retailers have adopted policies to label and market some food products as regenerative or as regenerative organic based on criteria developed under various private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives. Definitions and marketing claims under these initiatives vary, depending on the food product sold and the specific goals and objectives of the group promoting the initiative. Some RA and ROA initiatives are broadly focused on certain minimally applied production practices, and others are highly prescriptive and specify wide-ranging and explicit practices intended to achieve certain production and environmental outcomes. Some initiatives include a wide range of social welfare outcomes, such as assurances of farmer profitability and minimum salaries and benefits for workers, promotion of locally sourced foods, and considerations of Indigenous agricultural practices and animal welfare protections. Aside from general labeling requirements and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, private sector efforts are not verifiable or enforceable by federal or state rules. Farmers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers may find it challenging to navigate uncertainty about what is meant by RA and ROA and how to interpret marketing claims on foods labeled as regenerative compared with other sustainable food product claims.</p><p>* * *</p><p>1 U.S. Congress, House Committee on Agriculture, Past Breakthroughs and Future Innovations in Crop Production, hearing, 119th Cong., 1st sess., July 22, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=\">https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=</url> 118519.</p><p>2 Since the start of the second Trump Administration, both the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have announced reorganization and restructuring plans.

Congress may consider whether to identify which USDA conservation standards and product marketing schemes are considered to be regenerative and whether to establish a federal regulatory framework to oversee marketing claims about foods labeled as regenerative or labeled as produced using regenerative farming practices. The 119th Congress may also consider related legislative efforts and policies, such as promotion of regenerative farming principles by the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) congressional caucus, which has a stated goal of \"advancing regenerative and precision agriculture and environmental efforts.\"/4</p><p>Terms and Definitions</p><p>Absence of Uniform RA and ROA Definitions</p><p>Some federal legislation and state initiatives have proposed definitions of RA and ROA, but no such defined terms have been codified in federal or state laws and regulations to date. In addition, there is no widely accepted consensus about how to define these terms. Currently, companies that label or market foods as regenerative are likely participating in various private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives. Foods labeled and marketed as regenerative under these initiatives are not certified or governed by any federal or state program, although some private sector initiatives may include regenerative practices and outcomes outlined in some federal programs and policies, such as standards and requirements comprising some USDA conservation and. organic certification programs, along with a focus on efforts to balance environmental, social, and economic principles. In addition, federal laws and regulations govern the labeling and marketing of food products to ensure foods sold in the United States are properly labeled and are not misbranded; however, current federal guidance does not specifically address \"regenerative\" food product labeling claims./5</p><p>USDA scientists note that RA \"seems to be defined differently by different people\" and that most definitions are \"based on the goal of regenerating soil\" and largely include practices that are \"in line with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)'s soil health principles\" and share a common goal with organic agriculture (i.e., optimizing soil health)./6</p><p>NRCS conservation practices include minimizing tillage, maximizing the amount of time roots are growing in soil, and adding organic amendments to soil (e.g., manures, crop and cover crop residues)./7</p><p>NRCS conservation practice standards are broadly applicable to most conventionally produced agriculture and may differ from those under USDA-certified organic agriculture regulations that prohibit certain practices and external inputs (such as the use of synthetic chemicals, sewage sludge, and biotechnology). Some researchers define RA according to NRCS principles: \"keeping soils continuously covered, minimizing soil disturbance, increasing biological diversity, keeping living roots in the soil, and integrating livestock\" to ensure soil health and carbon sequestration and reduce inputs while \"not sacrificing profitability.\"/8</p><p>* * *</p><p>4 See Sen.

In practice, they acknowledge that the regenerative label \"has been applied to nearly anything that improves farm outcomes and minimizes environmental impact.\"/9</p><p>This includes common agricultural and soil health practices intended to boost crop yields, mitigate production risks, improve soil conditions, increase input efficiency, reduce synthetic inputs, support new crop development, or enable new or alternative revenue streams (e.g., carbon credits or products marketed as organic or locally produced). The text box above illustrates some of the farming practices that may be considered to be regenerative.</p><p>ROA initiatives generally include RA farming practices (see text box above) as a base requirement that is supplemented by organic agricultural practices and standards. While some ROA initiatives require practices and standards under USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) regulations and federal certification process,/10 ROA initiatives, in most cases, reference practices associated with various private sector organic certification programs. Accordingly, ROA initiatives may include practices related to soil health, animal welfare, and social equity, among other practices, including planting perennials, developing pollinator and wildlife habitats, incorporating agroforestry systems, planting vegetative barriers, and implementing practices that may develop soil organic matter. The Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) notes that the leading regenerative practices cited by existing initiatives are reduced tillage, integration of livestock, use of cover crops and crop rotation systems, and low to no application of external inputs (such as chemicals and biotechnology). According to OFRF, current initiatives' leading desired outcomes include improved soil health and fertility, increased carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and improved water health and economic well-being of communities. OFRF claims that the aim of minimizing external inputs while maximizing ecological practices is captured in the principles of organic agriculture./11</p><p>Ambiguity about what is meant by RA and ROA has made it difficult to develop legislation on this topic and has raised concerns about potential misleading or deceptive claims related to the sustainability and environmental benefits of a product or practice claiming to be regenerative./12</p><p>Despite the lack of clarity, some food companies and retailers continue to incorporate sustainability and regenerative initiatives into their global supply chains.</p><p>* * *</p><p>9 Shane Thomas, \"If Every Company Is a Regenerative Ag Company, Then No Company Is a Regenerative Ag Company,\" Upstream Ag Insights, May 10, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://upstream.ag/p/if-every-company-is-a-regenerative-agcompany-then-no-company-is-a-regenerative-ag-company-4bcb8c340\">https://upstream.ag/p/if-every-company-is-a-regenerative-agcompany-then-no-company-is-a-regenerative-ag-company-4bcb8c340</url>.</p><p>10 The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 was enacted as part of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-624, Title XXI; 7 U.S.C.

Most researchers cite the Rodale Institute - a nonprofit organization that supports organic farming research, practices, and education - as among the first to formally coin the phrase \"regenerative agriculture\" in the early 1980s. Others cite earlier work by the National Association of Conservation Districts (NACD) and other groups./13</p><p>Some acknowledge general contributions in the early 20th century by soil scientist George Washington Carver of Tuskegee University,/14 among other pioneers of sustainable, organic, and alternative agriculture./15</p><p>Overall, regenerative farming has become one among several terms used to describe farming systems that seek to balance agricultural production with environmental goals./16</p><p>The following definition of RA is attributed to Robert Rodale of the Rodale Institute in 1983:/17</p><p>'Regenerative agriculture is one that, at increasing levels of productivity, increases our land and soil biological production base. It has a high level of built-in economic and biological stability. It has minimal to no impact on the environment beyond the farm or field boundaries. It produces foodstuffs free from biocides. It provides for the productive contribution of increasingly large numbers of people during a transition to minimal reliance on non-renewable resources.'</p><p>Historically, the Rodale Institute promoted regenerative farming as creating a \"permanently sustainable system,\" mainly through the use of organic farming and \"nonmainstream\" farming methods./18</p><p>This included \"avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides\" in exchange for \"more natural fertilizers and totally biological approaches to insect control,\" as well as growing a mixture of annual and perennial wild plants instead of monocropping annual crops, thus reducing the need for tillage and weed control. Similarly, NACD's promotion of regenerative farming cited efforts to \"slow the advance of desertification and soil salinization, reduce the loss of prime farmlands and fragile topsoils,\" support wildlife habitats, and reduce waste and water contamination, as well as \"in general, make rural America a far more healthy, satisfying, and financially rewarding place to live.\"/19</p><p>The Rodale Institute also has advocated for adding \"regenerative components to the present [farming] system in a bit-by-bit way.\"/20</p><p>* * *</p><p>13 R.

Most current ROA-recommended practices tend to be associated with private organic certification programs rather than with federal NOP certification standards and policies. These private sector programs may include practices similar to those required under NOP (e.g., cover cropping, crop rotation, low- to no-till farming, composting, and reduced use of persistent chemical pesticides and fertilizers), but they often include additional practices related to soil health, animal welfare, and social equity. In private programs, soil health practices (such as the development of soil organic matter) may include, for example, the \"addition of perennials, development of pollinator and wildlife habitats, incorporation of agroforestry systems, [and] vegetative barriers,\" among other practices./21</p><p>In 1985, Rodale defined ROA as a practice that \"improves the resources it uses, rather than destroying or depleting them\" and as a \"holistic systems approach to agriculture that encourages continual on-farm innovation for environmental, social, economic and spiritual wellbeing.\"/22 ROA was said to be distinct from sustainable agriculture since it \"takes advantage of the natural tendencies of ecosystems to regenerate when disturbed\"; is \"marked by tendencies towards closed nutrient loops, greater diversity in the biological community, fewer annuals and more perennials, and greater reliance on internal rather than external resources\"; and is \"aligned with forms of agroecology practiced by farmers concerned with food sovereignty the world over.\"/23</p><p>Unlike RA and ROA, sustainable agriculture is defined in statute for the purposes of USDA program implementation (see the text box below). Although this term is defined in statute, multiple interpretations of sustainability are used to market food products and there is limited federal guidance regarding sustainable food labeling and packaging claims.</p><p>Process-Based and Outcome-Based Definitions</p><p>While research and initiatives focused on RA and ROA have increased since the mid-2010s, the meaning of each term varies depending on the group defining, certifying, and promoting such product claims. How RA and ROA are defined has led to tension./24 In general, such definitions vary depending on whether labeling a product as regenerative is determined by the use of specific farming practices (i.e., process-based) or certain desired goals (i.e., outcome-based) or both./25</p><p>* * *</p><p>21 Regenerative Organic Alliance, \"Why RegenerativeOrganic?,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenorganic.org/why-regenerative-organic/\">https://regenorganic.org/why-regenerative-organic/</url>.</p><p>22 USDA's National Agricultural Library (NAL), oral history interview with Robert Rodale in 1989, available at Rodale Institute, \"Regenerative Organic Agriculture: Beyond Sustainable,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/</url>.</p><p>23 Rodale Institute, Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change, 2014, <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/wpcontent/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/wpcontent/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf</url>.</p><p>24 Janet Ranganathan et al., \"Regenerative Agriculture: Good for Soil Health, but Limited Potential to Mitigate Climate Change,\" World Resources Institute, May 12, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soilhealth-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change;\">https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soilhealth-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change;</url> David Bronner, \"Regenerative Agriculture: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" All-One Blog, Dr. Bronner's, March 11, 2024, <url normalizedValue=\"https://info.drbronner.com/all-one-blog/2024/03/regenerativeagriculture-good-bad-ugly/;\">https://info.drbronner.com/all-one-blog/2024/03/regenerativeagriculture-good-bad-ugly/;</url> and Keith Paustian et al., Climate Mitigation Potential of Regenerative Agriculture Is Significant!, Regenerative Agriculture Foundation, June 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document\">https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document</url>.</p><p>25 See, for example, Peter Newton et al., \"What Is Regenerative Agriculture?

Process-based RA (or ROA) definitions may explicitly exclude certain practices, such as those that negatively impact soil health and biodiversity as well as those that use synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, biotechnology, intensive tillage, monocropping, concentrated animal feeding systems, or soilless production systems (e.g., hydroponic and aquaponic). Overall, a process-based RA definition is based on an actual or perceived relationship between a process and a particular outcome./28</p><p>In contrast, examples of outcome-based RA definitions may include claims such as enhanced soil health (e.g., regarding structure, organic matter, and fertility); improved ecosystem function (e.g., water quality and pasture quality); increased biodiversity; carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; improved farm productivity (e.g., better crop yields and crop resilience) and profitability; reduced waste; improved human health (e.g., food safety, access, and nutritional quality); and improved animal health and welfare, among other social or community well-being benefits./29 In general, outcome-based RA is accepting of all of the processes that lead to a desired outcome; if the approach includes multiple outcomes, then any process used would have to contribute to (or at least not hinder) the accomplishment of all outcomes./30</p><p>Claimed Benefits and Criticism</p><p>Advocates of RA and ROA claim the benefits of implementing regenerative practices include improved soil quality and resilience, sequestration of carbon in soil, climate change mitigation, improved crop yields and ecosystem services, reduced runoff and subsequent soil and water resource degradation, minimized pesticide residues and exposure, reduced energy use, improved biodiversity conservation, and enhanced food security./31 In addition to environmental benefits, other research suggests possible benefits include enhanced food nutritional quality and improved human health as well as food availability and affordability if food is produced locally./32 Other research claims economic and social benefits, including improved farmer profitability from reduced input costs, risk mitigation, and higher output value; enhanced local food production; food security; and employment./33 Although regenerative farming is generally more labor-intensive than conventional farming, the labor costs might be offset by lower input costs elsewhere, such as reduced agrochemical and energy inputs and possible higher farm income.</p><p>* * *</p><p>28 Some studies have examined outcomes using combined (or stacked) practices based on different growing or geographic conditions.

In the 118th Congress, H.R. 598 identified 32 different farming conservation practices considered to be regenerative agricultural practices, or \"any other highly effective and evidence-based vegetative or management practice, as determined by the Secretary, based on an annual review, that significantly reduces agricultural greenhouse gas emissions or assists producers in adapting to, or mitigating against, increasing weather volatility.\" Practices identified in H.R. 598 were part of broader efforts to address climate-related concerns.</p><p>Another 118th Congress bill, H.R. 9631, included a definition of regeneratively produced agricultural products - those that use an \"integrated approach to farming and ranching rooted in the principles of soil health leading to improved target outcomes\" and \"in a manner that fosters community and social wellness.\" H.R. 9631 also included a definition of regeneratively-organically produced agricultural products as those that also meet additional requirements and production methods described in the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.6501 et seq.). H.R. 9631 proposed these definitions for the purposes of establishing a Food as Medicine program promoting foods that are regeneratively produced, organically produced, or both.</p><p>Committees in the 117th Congress conducted a series of hearings on RA in 2022./40 Also in the 117th Congress, H.Res. 1234 would have expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services\" and resolved to \"support and fund programs that provide resources to agricultural scientists and other public interest scientists to work with farmers to identify innovations, the replicability of regenerative practices, and sustainable and resilient systems.\" H.Res. 1234 referred to RA as a \"system of farming and ranching principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches the soil, and purifies watersheds, all while increasing in-farm fertility.\" H.Res. 1234 claimed \"regenerative practices and sustainable agriculture works to restore ecosystems, combat climate change, build soil health, prevent erosion, and improve water quality,\" among other benefits.</p><p>Other introduced legislation would have amended USDA conservation programs to include RA but did not specifically define RA-related terms or practices. For example, in the 118th Congress, H.R. 5951/S. 3023 suggested that, at minimum, RA training would cover conservation practices that \"improve soil health, reduce production inputs, and regenerate soil, farmland, and nearby ecosystems,\" as well as organic and diversified practices (such as perennial cropping systems, agroforestry or silvopasture systems, livestock integration into cropping systems, and prescribed grazing) and practices that mitigate climate impacts and draw on \"traditional ecological knowledge\" from various producer groups.</p><p>State Government Example</p><p>In January 2025, the California State Board of Food and Agriculture (CSBFA) finalized its recommendations to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) on defining RA for the purpose of the state's agricultural policies and programs./41 See the text box below.</p><p>* * *</p><p>40 See, for example, U.S. Congress, House Committee on Agriculture, \"Soil Health Practices and Programs that Support Regenerative Agriculture,\" hearing, 117th Cong., 2nd sess., September 14, 2022, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/LC69492/text;\">https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/LC69492/text;</url> and U.S. Congress, House Oversight and Reform Committee, Subcommittee on Environment, \"Regenerative Agriculture: How Farmers and Ranchers are Essential to Solving Climate Change and Increasing Food Production,\" hearing, 117th Cong., 2nd sess., July 19, 2022, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/115012\">https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/115012</url>.

The proposed definition is intended as \"continuous implementation of practices that over time minimize inputs and environmental impacts and further enhances the ecosystem while maintaining or improving productivity, economic contributions and community benefits.\" This approach is said to have been informed \"by the traditions and innovations from the original Indigenous stewards of the land.\" The definition is not intended for use in certification.</p><p>Source: CDFA, Staff Draft: Defining Regenerative Agriculture for State Policies and Programs. The proposed draft definition references policies and practices at USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service; the California Department of Pesticide Regulation; and various University of California research initiatives. AB-1757 refers to Assembly Bill 1757 (California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006).</p><p>* * *</p><p>CSBFA's recommendations incorporate certain RA-related target outcomes found in state and federal sustainability strategies, including in CDFA's Healthy Soils Program, USDA conservation standards, and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation's sustainable pest management efforts. CDFA's definition does not include organic certification as a base requirement to qualify as regenerative, despite related efforts to increase transition from conventional to organic agriculture in the state./42 To date, these recommendations have not been codified in state law. No other state government has initiated similar efforts to officially define RA or ROA.</p><p>International Examples</p><p>Sustainable agriculture and RA topics are being debated and examined within a variety of international forums and intergovernmental organizations, including the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p><p>The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has set broad sustainability goals since the 1970s, resulting in efforts to address sustainable agriculture and resilient agroecosystems. Some earlier efforts encompassed objectives spanning ethics and fairness, resource protections, biodiversity, economic viability, rural and socioeconomic development, and social responsibility./43 Decades later, these topics continue to be debated. For example, sustainable and regenerative production were topics at the 2023 Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its subsidiary agreement, the Paris Agreement./44 Among other outcomes, COP28 identified a target related to food and food systems involving the need for \"implementation of integrated, multi-sectoral solutions, such as land use management, sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems\" and \"attain[ment of] climate-resilient food and agricultural production and supply and distribution of food, as well as increas[ed] sustainable and regenerative production and equitable access to adequate food and nutrition for all\" by the year 2030./45 The COP28 decision on the Paris Agreement's global goal on adaptation sets an identical 2030 target./46 Although RA has been said to be closely aligned with the UNSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that seek to \"promote sustainable agriculture\" (SDG-2),/47 the term is not explicitly referenced in the SDGs.</p><p>WTO's 1995 Agreement on Agriculture does not reference sustainable agriculture or RA but includes multiple references to agro-environmental issues. These include the need to protect the environment, support research and infrastructural works associated with environmental programs, and make allowances for \"special treatment reflecting factors of non-trade concerns, such as food security and environmental protection,\" including payments to agricultural producers that are \"part of a clearly-defined government environmental or conservation program.\"/48 WTO members continue to discuss how to facilitate sustainable agriculture within the global trade system,/49 and industry groups continue to propose ways to incorporate sustainability goals as part of agricultural subsidies subject to WTO commitments and obligations under the agreement./50 Previous multilateral agricultural trade talks, such as those at the WTO 12th Ministerial Conference in 2021-2022, discussed but did not implement possible sustainable trade liberalizations, among other topics./51</p><p>* * *</p><p>42 Rebekah Weber, \"California Creates Guidance for Regenerative Agriculture - A Mixed Bag,\" California Certified Organic Farmers, January 14, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ccof.org/news/california-creates-guidance-for-regenerativeagriculture-a-mixed-bag/;\">https://www.ccof.org/news/california-creates-guidance-for-regenerativeagriculture-a-mixed-bag/;</url> and Brad Hooker, \"In Defining Regenerative Ag, CDFA Ignites Debate over California's Farming Future,\" Agri-Pulse, September 13, 2023.</p><p>43 Heinrich Wohlmeyer and Theodor Quendler, eds., The WTO, Agriculture and Sustainable Development (Routledge, 2017), pp. 244-245, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351282123\">https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351282123</url>.</p><p>44 Conferences of the Parties (COPs) are convened under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a multilateral treaty adopted in 1992, and seek to identify and assess climate measures (see UAE Consensus COP 28 UAE, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cop28.com/en/;\">https://www.cop28.com/en/;</url> and UNFCCC, \"The Paris Agreement,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement</url>).

Through the Grassland Resilience and Conservation Initiative, participating ranchers will have the opportunity to leverage tools and resources to help them improve wildlife habitats, conserve water, and enhance soil health. McDonald's USA also believes that this initiative will help boost its U.S. supply chain resilience, including by providing participating ranchers economic returns such as incentive payments.</p><p><br/>Certain McDonald's USA suppliers, including Cargill, Golden State Foods, Lopez Foods, OSI and The Coca-Cola Company have elected to provide funds to NFWF alongside McDonald's USA. NFWF will independently award competitive grants to organizations that will assist participating ranchers in adopting practices that advance wildlife conservation and regenerative agriculture.<br/>\"As a brand that serves more than 90% of Americans every year, we recognize the responsibility we have to help safeguard our food systems for long-term vitality,\" said Cesar Pin\u0303a, Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, North America. \"Through our support of this initiative, McDonald's USA is demonstrating the power of partnership between the public and private sectors and that feeding the population and stewarding our natural resources can coexist.\"<br/>Many ranchers take pride in serving as stewards of the land, taking care of their communities to help create a better and brighter future. Building off current ranch-level best practices, this initiative will provide new pathways and resources to help accelerate regenerative grazing for ranchers, like those who are invaluable to McDonald's U.S. supply chain. NFWF's selected partner organizations will work with ranchers to help improve grazing land management, protect and restore grasslands and other natural ecosystems, safeguard water, and upgrade ranch infrastructure such as fencing and water systems.<br/>\"The benefits of grassland conservation are far-reaching,\" said Jeff Trandahl, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer at NFWF. \"When cattle are managed to optimize multiple ecological and economic values, the land holds more water, grows better grass and supports more wildlife. Conservation practices voluntarily adopted by ranchers can improve the productivity of grasslands, increase ranching profitability and strengthen the vitality of rural communities across the United States.\"<br/>As part of this initiative, NFWF will manage and invest conservation funding to advance ranchers in their voluntary conservation efforts. NFWF is collaborating with its conservation partners across America's grasslands to identify impactful landscape-scale projects that will generate the greatest possible benefits to both wildlife populations and the productivity of vital U.S. ranch lands. The first round of competitive grant-making will culminate in the announcement of awards, expected in January 2026.<br/>On behalf of McDonald's USA, Kateri and Carbon Yield will provide independent monitoring and quantification of any improvements to soil health.<br/>For additional information about the Grassland Resilience and Conservation Initiative, visit NFWF .<br/>About McDonald's USA<br/>McDonald's USA, LLC, serves a variety of menu options made with quality ingredients to millions of customers every day.

Mercury is the nearest named community and also happens to be the closest locality to the geometric center of Texas. From there, the heart of Texas, the father and son team of Jim and Stephen West are working, along with the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), to establish their operation using regenerative farming and management methods.</p><p>Jim, a retired Marine and patriarch of the family, and Stephen, with a college degree in agriculture, enjoy pushing the boundaries of traditional farming practices. Their partnership is more than a business venture, it's a testament to collaboration and core values.</p><p>\u201cWe \u2019 re bringing together different conservation practices to create a regenerative farming system,\u201d said Jim.</p><p>\u201cWe hope to show it \u2019 s possible to naturally grow crops and raise animals through diversity. \u201d</p><p>Their commitment to the process of regenerative farming, along with help from NRCS programs and personnel, is proving to be a winning combination.</p><p>A different approach</p><p>Regenerative agriculture takes a different approach compared to conventional methods.</p><p>Regenerative methods look at how all the parts of the process fit and work together. It looks at the system as a whole, not individual pieces. Its aim is to let natural processes take the lead, with management decisions made to enhance or restore those processes. The use of external inputs, especially synthetic forms, are minimized or eliminated completely.</p><p>\u201cIt \u2019 s this very complex system of nature taking care of nature,\u201d said Jim.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is based on five key principles; keeping the soil covered, increasing diversity, minimizing soil disturbance, maintaining living roots and integrating livestock.</p><p>The Wests look to incorporate these principles in all their decisions.</p><p>From their rotational grazing system, diversity in crops and animals, use of chickens as pest control, and unique fertilizer, they are practicing what they preach.</p><p>Jim began researching regenerative agriculture in the early 2000s while still in military service with the Marine Corp.</p><p>He wanted to understand the chemistry and biology behind it.</p><p>Books, articles, podcasts, videos, he took in all the information he could find. He also began to make his own observations from his travels with the military.</p><p>Having been stationed around the world in places like the Philippines, Korea, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, the experiences piqued his curiosity. Having learned from each one, he was curious as to why certain things worked in some areas and not others.</p><p>\u201cI watched the land here \u2014 not just our place \u2014 because everybody who \u2019 s using land has a vision for what they want to do and I \u2019 m not going to fault their vision,\u201d said Jim. \u201cI think we can do ag a lot better in the US. I just thought, \u2018There \u2019 s got to be a better way. \u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a landowner to come in with plans for regenerative farming and soil health \u2014 is not very common,\u201d said NRCS Brady Resource Team Leader, Haden Keyser. \u201cWhen Jim and Stephen came to me with this idea, the research and knowledge they have on this system gives me hope they are going to be successful. \u201d</p><p>All in the family</p><p>The journey for Sunrise W Land and Cattle began after Jim retired from military service.</p><p>He was able to acquire his grandfather's 600-acre ranch to combine with property he already owned. The move not only honored his family's history but sparked a vision he and Stephen had for their own operation. They were also able to purchase another piece of property just a mile down the road.</p><p>With the land they wanted under their control, all that was left was to install the system they had envisioned.</p><p>Stephen's agricultural knowledge and expertise, coupled with Jim \u2019 s decades of experience and leadership, has created a synergy. This drives innovation and progress on every inch of the property.</p><p>Even the name of the ranch, Sunrise W, has meaning and purpose.</p><p>\u201cW of course, our last name is West,\u201d said Jim. \u201cThe arc on top \u2014 I taught my kids there \u2019 s five C \u2019 s to living a good life: candor, competence, compassion, courage, and core values. If you \u2019 ll notice, there \u2019 s five rays to the sun. And so that became our cattle brand. \u201d</p><p>They are quick to point out a silent partner that plays a significant role as well.</p><p>\u201cMom doesn \u2019 t come out too often. She still works a job in San Antonio,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cBut she \u2019 s our CFO. Everything runs through her. At the end of the day she keeps my dad and I grounded for sure. \u201d</p><p>NRCS Partnership in Restoring the Land</p><p>Initially on their own, the property was so heavily covered in mesquite, that the first two years were spent clearing portions of the land. The invasive brush was removed mechanically, stacked and the piles burned to give them a blank canvas to start from.</p><p>Looking for information about the flood prevention dam on the property, the Wests came to the NRCS office in Brady. The conversation soon turned to conservation and the plan they had in mind. From that starting point, the Wests have worked closely with NRCS.</p><p>Now, the focus is on improving their pastures.</p><p>The Wests have been able to implement conservation practices that complimented their regenerative program.</p><p>The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) has been the main source of NRCS program participation for the Wests.</p><p>EQIP offers technical and financial assistance for working agriculture lands. It helps farmers and ranchers maintain or improve production while conserving natural resources. NRCS works one-on-one with producers to develop a conservation plan that outlines practices and activities to solve on-farm resource issues. EQIP helps make conservation accessible.</p><p>For the Wests, this included practices such as fencing, water development, additional brush clearing and grass seeding. Through EQIP, they have been able to install infrastructure that allows their operation to run smoothly.</p><p>\u201cSo, the NRCS has been one, a great resource of knowledge, then also has been a great resource in getting these projects \u2014 on the ground,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cIt can be very labor intensive when it comes to having to move animals every single day and having the water for them as well. \u201d</p><p>The Wests utilize a management intensive grazing system. In this system, the cattle are concentrated on a small area for a short time. The goal of this system is better grazing utilization, encouraging livestock to eat everything within the grazing area.

It follows the cattle in rotation through the pastures, 2-3 days behind. The coop houses several hundred Rhode Island Red chickens.</p><p>The chickens fill multiple roles.</p><p>Manure is a natural fertilizer that benefits pasture grasses and is a resource that is abundant in livestock operations. This is especially the case in intensively managed systems like the Wests \u2019 that concentrate animals on smaller acres. The chickens scratch through the cattle manure, spreading it out and making the coverage more uniform. They also eat insects that are attracted to it. By following the cattle closely in rotation, the chickens take care of the insects before they become a problem. This is especially true of flies, which are a common problem for livestock producers.</p><p>They also provide a product that can be sold, eggs.</p><p>Being raised on pasture, input for production is lower and the eggs fetch a premium price being cage-free and organic.</p><p>Worm tea is a practice that is not common but shows promise as a fertilizer alternative.</p><p>Worms perform the important task of decomposition. As they process materials, they return important nutrients back to the soil and boost microbial activity. This in turn benefits other soil microorganisms like bacteria, fungi and protozoa. All of these parts and organisms combined form a healthy, fertile soil.</p><p>\u201cEarthworms are nature \u2019 s way of putting biology back into the soil,\u201d explains Jim, \u201cwhich is exactly what we want. \u201d</p><p>The Wests have taken this beneficial natural process and have adapted into making their own worm tea.Worm tea is made by taking the decomposed materials from worms, called worm castings, adding water, and allowing it to \u201cbrew\u201d. Though this is an oversimplification, the process allows the beneficial microorganisms to reproduce and form a natural liquid fertilizer that is readily absorbed by plants.</p><p>The Wests have a large bin of approximately 100,000 worms that they collect the castings from. The bin is filled with compost and mixed with a blend of grains that is food for the worms. They collect the castings once a week from the bottom of the flow-through bin. From there, the castings go into what the Wests call the brewer. It can best be described as a super-sized Keurig machine. The container is filled with water and aerated for 24 hours, allowing the microorganisms in the castings to multiply. The product at the end of the process is a nutrient and microorganism dense, all-natural fertilizer. They then spray the liquified worm tea onto their pastures.</p><p>\u201cWe have been accused of being odd,\u201d said Stephen with a chuckle.</p><p>All of these conservation measures, both traditional and new, combine to form a regenerative system that is benefitting both the land and the operation.</p><p>A Bright Future Ahead</p><p>Looking ahead, the Wests are hoping their approach can become a model others can learn from and replicate.</p><p>Jim and Stephen are dedicated to sharing their knowledge and experience with fellow landowners. They hold classes, participate in interviews, and create videos to educate and inspire others to embrace regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn \u2019 t trade it. You know, just seeing the difference,\u201d said Jim. \u201cMy ultimate goal is that whoever we deal with believes we \u2019 re providing more nutritious food and that we \u2019 re taking care of both them and the land and animals at the same time. And that \u2019 s really what drives me. \u201d</p><p>Keyser, who calls himself one of the Wests \u2019 biggest fans, is excited to see how their land responds.</p><p>\u201cThey want people to come up to their fence and ask, \u2018What are you doing over there? \u2019 and find success so they can share what they \u2019 re doing. They \u2019 re not afraid to work \u2014 and they believe in this,\u201d said Keyser.</p><p>Broyles, too, admires the Wests \u2019 out-of-the-box approach. \u201cThese systems they have here\u2014it \u2019 s how hard do you want to work?

(CSE: ERTH) on the successful commissioning of its Beiseker granulated fertilizer facility, hailing it as a transformative milestone for both the company and the sustainable agriculture sector. Upon reaching full capacity, the new Beiseker plant is expected to generate up to CAD $15.6 million in annual revenues with gross margins exceeding 30%. As one of ESGFIRE's standout investments in regenerative agriculture, Replenish's achievement validates the scalable business model we championed and underpins our confidence in the company's robust cash flow potential and industry leadership in sustainable fertilizer solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beiseker commissioning</emphasis>In this first phase of operations, Replenish's Beiseker facility has begun producing the company's proprietary granulated fertilizers, with ongoing ramp-up aimed at 2,000 tonnes per month of throughput at full scale. These volumes translate into a run-rate of approximately $13\u2013$16 million in annual revenue at 30%+ gross profit margins, supporting a healthy ~$4 million gross profit stream. Such economics are expected to yield strong free cash flows for Replenish, enabling the company to self-fund growth and debt reduction initiatives.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward looking projections with Debolt</emphasis>Beyond the immediate financial metrics, the commissioning of the Beiseker facility solidifies ReplenishNutrients' position as a leader in regenerative agriculture. The company has pioneered a patented, zero-waste fertilizer technology and established distribution across over a million acres of North American farmland \u2013 achievements that set it apart in a sector long dominated by traditional incumbents. This new facility is more than just an increase in production; it's a proof point that sustainable agriculture innovations can be scaled profitably. \"Beiseker is more than a facility \u2014 it's a blueprint for what comes next,\" Replenish CEO Neil Wiens noted in the company's release, a sentiment we echo at ESGFIRE. We view this successful start-up as a template for Replenish's scalable growth model, with an additional project (DeBolt) in the development pipeline that can replicate this model across new regions. In particular, Replenish's upcoming DeBolt facility in Alberta is planned to produce up to 50,000 tonnes per year of regenerative fertilizer with similar margins and pricing as Beiseker translating into additional potential annual revenues of ~CA$30 million. We anticipate hearing further updates on DeBolt's progress soon, as it represents the next major step in Replenish's expansion strategy. With the global shift toward regenerative farming gaining momentum, Replenish is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on rising demand for environmentally friendly nutrient solutions. The consistent 30%+ margins and field-proven efficacy of its products not only advance sustainable soil health but also demonstrate that green innovations can deliver attractive returns. ESGFIRE also highlights the fact that ReplenishNutrients have a scalability in licensing their plant model to external actors, a feature they are almost unique with in the agtech sector.ReplenishNutrients has proven itself as a flagship ESGFIRE portfolio company by uniting profitability with sustainability. The Beiseker facility's commissioning marks a turning point \u2013 it validates Replenish's ability to execute at scale and generate meaningful cash flow while healing the soil. This accomplishment strengthens our confidence in Replenish's growth trajectory and reaffirms our investment thesis. We believe today's milestone foreshadows significant value creation ahead, as Replenish continues to expand its market reach and set new benchmarks in regenerative agriculture. ESGFIRE remains as optimistic as ever about Replenish's future and we are excited to soon see developments like DeBolt further contribute to its success.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About ESGFIRE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESGFIRE is an investment company and research firm that focuses on ESG companies with either an environmentally friendly service or product.

The profit maximizing optimization model of a 500 hectare (ha) British West Midlands farm found that per annum profitability of regenerative strip intercropping system was \u00a356.88 ha-1 higher for farm operated using smaller swarm robotics than farm operated using smaller conventional mechanization with human drivers. The conventional whole field sole cropping system operated using larger machines with human drivers returned \u00a3128.36 ha-1 per annum less than regenerative strip intercropping operated using swarm robotics. Adding livestock component with crop only regenerative strip intercropping system resulted negative return per annum (- \u00a326.72 ha-1). The added labour for livestock rearing, forage and manure transport, and higher machine costs challenged competitiveness of regenerative system with livestock.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This reinforcing the need to more completely automate public road transport and intensive livestock rearing. Results indicate that swarm robotics have potential to change the cost calculus of RA practices, while livestock integration needs careful cost-effective designs to reinforce farm profitability.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Autonomous regenerative agriculture: Swarm robotics to change farm economics.

Of the 50 companies, FAIRR's study found that 18 (36%) quantified company-wide RA targets; 8 (16%) discussed RA metrics and data; 4 (8%) set baselines to measure progress; and 4 (8%) set targets to financially support farmers in deploying regenerative practices. Other studies corroborate that most labeling schemes do not tend to monitor or evaluate the environmental and social benefits of their programs; others note the need for more and higher-quality information given the proliferation of labels and the potential to confuse consumers./54 These types of findings have caused some to question whether the food industry's adoption of RA and other related sustainability practices has generated expected environmental and societal benefits./55</p><p>Definitions vary among different producer groups. For example, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) has called for RA to be \"defined as any production system that minimizes environmental impacts, maximizes production and increases the productivity of soil over time.\"/56 AFBF's broader policy goals related to sustainability, which include RA, focus on the ability of U.S. farmers and ranchers to lead on \"climate-smart practices that reduce emissions, enrich the soil and protect our water and air, all while producing more food, fiber and renewable fuel\" through \"voluntary, market-driven programs.\"/57 Field to Market, an agricultural membership organization, similarly addresses both agricultural sustainability and regeneration by promoting a systems-based approach that \"sequesters carbon in the soil and intentionally improves soil health, biodiversity, water quality and air quality while ensuring the viability of farm production.\"/58 The International Fresh Produce Association (IFPA) defines RA \"as a suite of sustainable farming practices that are holistic and outcome-based, improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity, optimizing water use, and building climate resilience,\" including \"practices such as minimal soil disturbance, cover cropping, diverse crop rotations, and integrated pest and nutrient management,\" and supports \"voluntary and incentive-based transitions to and scaling of RA.\"/59</p><p>Selected Industry Initiatives</p><p>To facilitate the food industry's RA adoption, a network of food companies - including Nestle, Danone, Unilever, and PepsiCo - released a global framework in 2023 on how to help businesses implement regenerative practices. As defined by the group, RA refers to \"an outcome-based farming approach that protects and improves soil health, biodiversity, climate, and water resources while supporting farming business development.\"/60 The framework covers four impact areas - water, soil, biodiversity, and climate - and recommends actions such as conducting risk screening assessments, selecting and measuring outcomes, adopting RA-related principles and practices, and monitoring and assessing progress. In 2020, a different private sector agribusiness task force composed of financial institutions, food manufacturers, and farmer organizations - including Bayer AG, McCain Foods, McDonald's Corporation, Mondelez International Inc., and PepsiCo - released an action plan to accelerate the adoption of regenerative farming.</p><p>* * *</p><p>52 See, for example, R.

For example, ADM's RA initiative is based on five land management principles: (1) minimizing soil disturbance; (2) maintaining living roots in soil; (3) continuously covering bare soil; (4) maximizing diversity with an emphasis on crops, soil microbes, and pollinators; and (5) responsibly managing inputs, including nutrients and pesticides./62 Cargill's initiative supports farmers who adopt \"regenerative soil health practices,\" such as planting cover crops, reducing tillage, optimizing nutrients, managing grazing, and implementing agroforestry practices./63 The General Mills (GM) initiative is part of its broader effort to reduce GHG emissions and address water resources in priority watersheds, among other projects that deliver \"positive environmental, social and economic outcomes.\"/64 GM's practices include minimizing soil disturbance and promoting soil health (e.g., by planting cover crops and reducing tillage); improving water quality (e.g., through water management and infiltration); promoting biodiversity (e.g., wildlife and beneficial organisms); restoring ecosystems and forests (e.g., through nutrient cycling, water infiltration, and pest suppression); and promoting adaptive grazing and livestock feed management.</p><p>Some food companies work directly with food retailers (Walmart and Whole Foods Market, for example) that have adopted regenerative initiatives as a way to market foods they sell. Walmart's RA initiative requires producers to follow certain production principles, including soil and nutrient management (e.g., through planting cover crops and implementing conservation tillage, crop rotation, and nutrient management systems); pest management (e.g., implementing integrated pest management or planting diverse flowering native or naturalized plants); and water and land management and priority area protection (e.g., abstaining from using recently converted land and placing land in an agriculture conservation easement to protect, restore, and enhance wetlands, grasslands, and forests)./65 Whole Foods Market's initiative requires foods to be produced using practices that improve soil health through improved biodiversity, minimize soil disturbance, maintain a living root system year-round, maximize soil cover to protect against erosion and improve water retention, and integrate strategic rotational grazing and other animal management practices to improve soil fertility through increased microbial density and organic matter (i.e., animal manure)./66</p><p>* * *</p><p>61 Sustainable Markets Initiative, Agribusiness Task Force, Scaling Regenerative Farming: Levers for Implementation, December 2023, accessible through <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sustainable-markets.org/taskforces/agribusiness-task-force/\">https://www.sustainable-markets.org/taskforces/agribusiness-task-force/</url>.</p><p>62 ADM, \"Regenerative Agriculture,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adm.com/en-us/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture/\">https://www.adm.com/en-us/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture/</url>.</p><p>63 Cargill, \"Cargill RegenConnect(R),\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenconnect.cargill.com/;\">https://regenconnect.cargill.com/;</url> and Cargill, \"Regenerative Agriculture,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cargill.com/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture\">https://www.cargill.com/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture</url>.</p><p>64 General Mills, \"Regenerative Agriculture,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.generalmills.com/how-we-make-it/healthier-planet/environmental-impact/regenerative-agriculture\">https://www.generalmills.com/how-we-make-it/healthier-planet/environmental-impact/regenerative-agriculture</url>.</p><p>65 Walmart, \"Walmart Policies and Guidelines: Sustainable Row Crop Position Statement - Sustainable Products at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S.,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#sustainable-row-crop-position-statement\">https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#sustainable-row-crop-position-statement</url>.</p><p>66 Whole Foods Market, \"Our Commitment to Regenerative Agriculture,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-in-action/environmental-stewardship/regenerative-agriculture\">https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-in-action/environmental-stewardship/regenerative-agriculture</url>.

In addition to the programs discussed here, there are numerous private RA and ROA certification programs worldwide./67</p><p>These types of food labeling initiatives represent a subset of food labeling and packaging claims spanning a wide range of product attributes for foods, which are often referred to as food process labels. They are used by marketers to distinguish and create a unique brand for their products with the goal of increasing sales and company profits./68 Process labels usually cover a range of attributes (e.g., the types of practices and ingredients used to produce a product) but may also include certain environmental or societal objectives and certain seals of approval. Examples of product attributes include those attesting to a product's food safety, quality, freshness date, nutrition, or cleanliness, as well as natural, healthy, organic, fair trade, sustainable, kosher, halal, humane animal treatment, bee- or bird-safe, local, and carbon offsetting claims, among other \"free-of\" claims (e.g., biotechnology-free, cage-free, free-range, and dolphin-free)./69 Some researchers have raised concerns about the extent and scale of such food labeling claims./70</p><p>Attributes used to market products that meet specific environmental performance criteria are also referred to as \"ecolabels,\" covering both food and non-food products./71 Ecolabels may be owned or managed by government agencies, but most U.S. food and beverage ecolabeling and certification schemes are voluntary and initiated by private industry, food retailers, and nongovernmental organizations. Compliance with voluntary labeling claims or certification standards may often be self-enforced by the producer or may be verified by the organization to which the producer belongs or by an independent third party.

Most private sector RA initiatives broadly reference agricultural practices and standards similar to USDA's national conservation practice standards developed and maintained by NRCS. Some private sector ROA initiatives broadly share some of the practices and standards under USDA's NOP. Various federal laws and regulations govern the labeling and marketing of food products to ensure foods sold in the United States are properly labeled and not misbranded.</p><p>Although there are no statutory, regulatory, or formal administrative definitions of RA and ROA, many of the soil health practices incorporated into most private sector initiatives are consistent with NRCS soil health principles. NRCS conservation practice standards and the organic agriculture sector often share the common goal of optimizing soil health. However, the full suite of approved NRCS conservation practice standards include activities that may be prohibited under USDA-certified NOP regulatory standards. Regardless of what regenerative farming practices are required under various private sector initiatives, federal labeling requirements, such as those under the authorities of FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), still apply.</p><p>USDANRCS National Conservation Practice Standards</p><p>A conservation practice standard describes when, where, and why a practice is applied, as well as the minimum planning criteria required in order to achieve the desired environmental improvement./74 Standards are developed by NRCS at a national level and then tailored to state- and local-specific requirements based on resource conditions and laws that may be more restrictive than national criteria./75 NRCS maintains close to 200 national conservation practice standards./76 These practice standards are based on scientific research and are reviewed and updated on a five-year cycle or earlier based on scientific and technological advancements. New and revised standards are available for public comment through the Federal Register.</p><p>Conservation practice standards are used by NRCS when providing technical assistance to individual farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners to address natural resource concerns on their operations. NRCS provides free technical assistance through field offices in nearly every U.S. county and territory./77 Technical assistance generally results in a conservation plan that includes specific conservation practices that, if applied according to the standard, would address or improve natural resources on the operation. Table 1 includes selected examples of national NRCS conservation practices for crops, providing a generic description of the practice.</p><p>* * *</p><p>73 For example, ISO, Online Browsing Platform, \"ISO 14020:2022(en) Environmental Statements and Programmes for Products - Principles and General Requirements,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso:14020:ed-3:v1:en\">https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso:14020:ed-3:v1:en</url>.</p><p>74 USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), \"Conservation Practice Standards Information,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/getting-assistance/conservation-practices\">https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/getting-assistance/conservation-practices</url>.</p><p>75 The technical guides, developed by NRCS and published at a geographically specific level, are known as Field Office Technical Guides (FOTGs).

The table is limited to crop-related practices. Livestock- and forestry-related practices are also included at the NRCS website cited above. The conservation practice code refers to practices eligible for financial assistance under NRCS's Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Groups of practices (\"bundles\") and enhanced conservation practices (\"enhancements\") are eligible for financial assistance under NRCS's Conservation Stewardship Program.

For example, as shown in Table 1, NRCS conservation practices highlight recommendations involving a series of conventional no-till and reduced till practices, which are widely considered regenerative practices. Some have questioned whether no-till and reduced tillage practices could result in the need for increased pesticide and synthetic fertilizer applications that may harm soil health and public safety; others dispute such ideas./79</p><p>Following the development of a conservation plan, an agricultural producer may choose to apply for federal financial assistance to offset the cost of implementing the plan and prescribed practices. Federal conservation programs are voluntary and typically cover a portion of the cost to implement an approved conservation plan and related practices./80 As such, implementation of NRCS conservation practices is voluntary. If financial assistance is provided through a federal conservation program, then, in accordance with a contract, the producer agrees to implement approved conservation practices according to the NRCS standards. NRCS will certify successful completion of the practices under contract, according to the standards, before making payments. Program participants are obligated to maintain conservation practices for the life of the practice.</p><p>Climate and Carbon Sequestration Initiatives</p><p>Some have identified improved soil health and carbon sequestration as potential benefits of RA and ROA agricultural practices that could help mitigate agricultural GHG emissions and make food systems more resilient./81 The United States does not have a singular policy to mitigate agricultural GHG emissions, although some individual programs and policies could contribute to such goal. In general, U.S. agricultural policies that address climate change and GHG mitigation promote voluntary and incentive-based actions rather than mandatory or regulatory approaches. Policy approaches have included investing in climate-related research, including mitigation and adaptation, as well as USDA conservation and technical assistance programs that may work to reduce agricultural GHG emissions, increase carbon dioxide removals from the atmosphere, sequester carbon, and adjust to weather variability.

For example, Regenerative Organic Certified requires USDA-certified organic as base certification plus additional soil health, animal welfare, and social welfare requirements (often referred to as USDA Organic Plus). Under such ROA initiatives, other requirements outside NOP may include, but are not limited to, animal welfare protections; development of pollinator and wildlife habitats; incorporation of agroforestry systems and vegetative barriers; promotion of locally sourced foods; considerations of Indigenous agricultural practices; and social equity considerations, such as farmer and farmworker protections./95 There is limited information comparing NOP requirements with those of private certification programs.</p><p>There is debate about whether USDA-certified organic foods provide additional benefits to the environment and consumers compared with conventionally produced foods. USDA's National Agricultural Library (NAL) examined scientific literature to study whether organically produced foods might be more nutritious (i.e., contain more vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients), more environmentally friendly (i.e., have fewer negative impacts on soil resources, water quality, energy consumption, and climate change), or safer (i.e., contain fewer pesticides or antibiotic and hormone residues) compared with conventionally produced foods./96 Based on its examination of peer-reviewed literature in 2008, NAL concluded there was evidence that organically produced foods, in general, may convey benefits to the environment and may contain fewer chemical residues compared with conventionally produced foods./97 NAL was not able to conclude that organically produced foods were more nutritious than conventionally produced foods,/98 and subsequent research has not definitively settled this question./99</p><p>Federal Food Product Labeling Requirements</p><p>Most RA and ROA initiatives and proposals administer private label certification schemes that specify a food product's adherence to the initiative's regeneration goals.

FFDCA (21 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.301 et seq.) regulates food labeling, ensuring foods (including dietary supplements) sold in the United States are safe, properly labeled, and include accurate nutrition information./102 FFDCA prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded foods and dietary supplements, including foods bearing labels that contain a false or misleading claim./103 FDA therefore could take action against any RA or ROA claim that is found to be false or misleading, but FDA does not define RA or ROA and does not provide any guidance on how to make such claims in a manner that is not false or misleading. FDA's implementing regulations set out the general requirements that apply to all food labels, which include a statement of identity, the net quantity, a list of ingredients, nutrition labeling, and any required allergen labeling./104 Under FDA laws and regulations, FDA is not required to preapprove labels for food products. FPLA (15 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.1451-1461; 16 C.F.R. Part 500) directs FDA and FTC to require that all consumer commodities be labeled to disclose net contents, identity of the commodity, and the name and place of business of the product's manufacturer, packer, or distributor in order to prevent consumer deception.</p><p>Other FTC authorities prohibit unlawful, \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce\" (Sec.5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act; 15 U.S.C. Sec.45(a))./105 Under this authority, FTC prohibits \"any false advertisement\" with regard to food products that is \"misleading in any respect.\"/106 FTC thus could take action against a misleading RA or ROA claim used in food advertising. FTC, however, generally does not take action against a marketing claim that complies with FDA regulations because FTC has \"traditionally accorded great weight to FDA's scientific determinations in matters of nutrition and health.\"/107 It is unclear if FTC would similarly defer to FDA's judgment regarding RA and ROA claims that are found to be false or misleading.</p><p>* * *</p><p>101 While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the labeling of most food products, USDA regulates the labeling of certain meat, poultry, and egg products.

Separately, some U.S. producer groups have expressed support for \"investments in voluntary and incentive-based transitions to and scaling of regenerative approaches.\"/133</p><p>Congress could debate the potential role of RA and ROA as part of ongoing MAHA efforts. Alternatively, Congress could consider whether to address RA and ROA outside the MAHA framework through hearings or review of legislative proposals.</p><p>* * *</p><p>122 Letters from United We Eat to HHS Secretary Robert F.

Our mission involves developing a knowledge and innovation base, testing novel concepts and approaches, and building a community of practice. In doing so, we recognize the complex adaptive nature of human and natural systems and the fundamental uncertainty that governs their evolution, and we thus emphasize the need for collaboration, experimentation, and learning. The places and value chains we intend to transform act as centres of gravity for our work.

Robert Bonnie, former undersecretary for farm production and conservation at the Department of Agriculture , says the generally interchangeable terms \"are all concerned with implementing practices that conserve the environment and cost-efficiently help farmers, ranchers and forest owners produce quality products while, at the same time, be stewards of their lands.\" Farm Bill and Inflation Reduction Act funds support many of the USDA's climate solutions programs. Because regenerative agriculture practices require long-term investments, training and time to show measurable results, \"This is where the USDA steps in to provide support through various resources including funding, research and collaborative public-private partnerships,\" Bonnie says. Since 2021, USDA's Regional Conservation Partnership Program has granted 334 awards totaling more than $3 billion. Since its inception in 2014, RCPP has given 812 awards involving more than 4,000 partner organizations, with more than $4 billion in Natural Resources Conservation Service funding amplified by another $4 billion in partner contributions.\u00a0 Examples of RCPP projects are wildlife habitat and native plant species restoration, which leads to biodiverse ecosystem stability. The USDA works with Native American cultures\u00a0 to improve water quality, protect at-risk wildlife species and manage sustainable bison grazing practices. Technology-driven initiatives, sometimes called \"precision agriculture,\" deliver fertilizer exactly where needed, thereby avoiding runoff. New technology also helps conserve water and reduce livestock methane gas emissions. According to an October 2024 Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities report, more than 21,000 enrolled farm producers and operations of all sizes voluntarily implement climate-smart production practices. These include conservation tillage, soil carbon amendment, growing cover crops and prescribed grazing. Affected commodities include fruits, vegetables, grains, livestock, hemp and timber. Funds are paid out over the five-year lifespans of the projects. Modeling success The Heifer Ranch Center for Regenerative Agriculture in Perryville, Ark., is a recognized model for how regenerative agriculture farming principles and practices can successfully heal the environment while producing at scale. The 1,200-acre ranch is an accredited Savory Global Network Hub with the Savory Institute, the world's largest and longest-operating grassland rehabilitation organization. Recently, Heifer Ranch also received certification from the Audubon Ranching Conservation Ranching Program. It monitors and recognizes ranches that regenerate grasslands, which provide healthy habitat for declining bird species. \"The center's focus is to train farmers and food system actors how to incorporate regenerative principles to manage the complexity of working with nature towards ecosystem health,\" says Director of Regeneration Donna Kilpatrick, who oversees all of Heifer Ranch's agricultural operations. In addition, \"Our mission is increased biodiversity, farmer profitability and farmer quality of life.\" This year, Heifer Ranch will host day-long and multiday training programs for farmers and those interested in regenerative food systems. The in-depth sessions are taught by staff experts and guest instructors who are leaders in their respective fields. Also, the ranch's free, instructional YouTube videos reach a worldwide audience. Its curriculum covers a variety of topics including holistic livestock and grazing management; sheep and poultry production; regenerative land management; and beekeeping. Because transitioning from conventional farming methods - often implemented for generations - can seem overwhelming, Kilpatrick recommends implementing one or two regenerative agriculture principles to start. Another tip: \"Find a community of other regenerative farmers to connect with for peer-to-peer learning, idea sharing and support,\" she says. Suzanne Hunt is co-owner of her family's seventh-generation farm and certified sustainable winery, Hunt Country Vineyards in Branchport, N.Y. She is also\u00a0vice president, policy for Generate Upcycle, a global leader in sustainable infrastructure for food waste, compost and wastewater. \"Every generation has to figure out how to be successful during the historic challenges of their time, and ours is climate change,\" Hunt says. Over the past two decades, the farm and winery have implemented a number of science-based practices. These include enhancing soil health, growing a diversity of crops, maintaining the farm's natural wild and pollinator habitats and investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy systems. Mulch, compost and biochar increase soil carbon levels and moisture and nutrient holding capacity. Nearly all heating, cooling and electricity used throughout the operation are generated onsite via solar and geothermal systems. Some farm vehicles operate on electricity, and visitors can charge their EVs on five chargers.

The advancement of farming techniques can be a game changer for future farmers who tend to have problems with dry, unsustainable soil.</p><p>This is especially important because soil promotes food production, filters water and supplies nutrients to crops. Regenerative agriculture seeks to achieve precisely that. Recent research has shown that regenerating soil may retain up to 30% more water than typically treated soil.</p><p>\"Regenerative agriculture encourages things like diverse crop selection, increasing organic matter and avoiding harmful practices like tilling and use of synthetic pesticides and herbicides,\" said Rebecca Lampl, an applied horticulture student at CSU.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture promotes the utilization of a variety of crops to create a more balanced and resilient environment. This variety helps\u00a0control pest populations, nurture soil bacteria and decrease dependence on synthetic fertilizers. Composting, cover cropping and decreased cultivation assist to increase soil organic matter.</p><p>As Lampl said, regenerative agriculture aims to reduce the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers that can harm soil health and biodiversity. It also promotes reduced or noncultivating methods to preserve the soil's foundation and the existence of bacteria.</p><p>While regenerative agriculture is coming to CSU with many benefits, it also has its challenges. Financial restrictions, a scarcity of natural soil additives and oppositions to change are among the obstacles that regenerative agriculture must overcome.</p><p>\"From the farmer and (agriculture) industry perspective, regenerative farming often requires a shift in mindset from one focused on maximizing crop yields each year to a longer-term view of optimizing the overall system, reducing input costs and maintaining stable, profitable yields over time,\" Schipanski said. \"This can present increased real and perceived risks for farmers as they transition from this shorter-term to longer-term net profitability focus.\"\u00a0</p><p>Transitioning to regenerative techniques may necessitate initial investments in resources and instruction, which can be problematic for many farmers and gardeners. When there is a scarcity of natural inputs, such as manure or compost, the implementation of regenerative methods may be impeded. As research is being conducted on the resistance that can arise when transitioning from traditional farming techniques, it may also pose a considerable problem.</p><p>Although there are many challenges, the success of this practice may help take farming and gardening techniques to a new level. The work of farmers will not go unnoticed, and the tools they use will now make their work more efficient. Regenerative agricultural practices will increase the health and resiliency of crops, helping them withstand even harsh weather conditions.</p><p>\"It is an ecosystem-based farming that understands that by mimicking nature, we can create sustainable and resilient food systems that regenerate our current degraded resources and ensure future food security,\" Lampl said.</p><p>Reach Natalee Garcia at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:science@collegian.com\">science@collegian.com</email> or on Twitter @CSUCollegian.</p>", "publisher": "University Wire", "instances": [".

But look closer, and signs emerge that Jorge is shedding tradition in the hope of future-proofing his farm.</p><p>Between the rows of chestnut and pistachio saplings, a mix of grasses covers the ground where a stretch of bare dirt would typically be \u2014 a deliberate attempt to prevent erosion. To retain water, Jorge has wrapped a blanket of wood chips around the base of each sapling. And among the young trees grow yellow lupin flowers, known as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tremocilha</emphasis> in Portuguese, that have a special power: they capture nitrogen and store it underground.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a natural fertilizer,\u201d Jorge says, looking out over the field of chest-high saplings under an intense springtime Sun. The flowers, mowing and mulch are part of Jorge\u2019s transition to regenerative agriculture, a method of farming that prioritizes soil health, boosts biodiversity, minimizes tilling and uses pesticides sparingly. \u201cAnything that we can do that adds resilience to the land, that preserves this land for the future, is always a better option,\u201d Jorge says, \u201cas long as it\u2019s economically viable, of course.\u201d</p><p>What humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet</p><p>The future is coming hard at Europe \u2014 the fastest-warming continent on the planet since the 1980s1. In just the past few years, farmers on the Iberian Peninsula have struggled with shrivelled crops, shrinking water supplies and more-frequent wildfires. Going forwards, the economic hit to the European Union and the United Kingdom from drought alone could reach more than \u20ac65 billion (US$76 billion) each year by 2100, in part because of crop damage and lost water supplies2.</p><p>With an estimated 4 \u00b0C of warming expected over the next 75 years if no action is taken to curb or adapt to climate change, southern and western Europe could lose 10% of its agricultural economic output2. Meanwhile, widespread erosion continues to sweep away soil, taking with it crucial nutrients and increasing the risk of flooding and landslides. Between 60% and 70% of soils in the EU are degraded, according to the European Commission.</p><p>These mounting risks are leading farmers such as Jorge to bet on regenerative agriculture. Together with climate advocates and scientists, they increasingly see these practices as key to withstanding changing climatic conditions \u2014 and to helping farmers stay in business. And Europe is showing how it can be done, they say.</p><p>\u201cWe believe right now we\u2019re at a point where the grassroots are spreading,\u201d says Simon Kr\u00e4mer, executive director at the European Alliance for Regenerative Agriculture (EARA), a farmer-led advocacy group in Berlin that was founded in 2023. According to Kr\u00e4mer, about 2% of farms in Europe are fully regenerative, and another 5\u201310% are on the regenerative path.</p><p>This budding regenerative revolution now faces some headwinds, however. After farmer protests across Europe in 2023 and 2024, the EU has backed away from some environmental requirements for the agricultural sector, and farmers say that incentives fall short of what\u2019s needed to help them make the transition.</p><p>But many advocates expect that the momentum behind regenerative agriculture will continue to build, particularly given Europe\u2019s need to meet its commitments to restore ecosystems and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. And farmers and researchers around the world are carefully watching Europe\u2019s attempts to pull off one of the biggest transitions in agriculture in generations. Regenerative agriculture, Kr\u00e4mer says, \u201cis the most important farmer and science movement in the world\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Saving the soil</emphasis></p><p>In Portugal and many other parts of the globe, farmers are coming to realize that what worked for their parents and grandparents is no longer viable. To survive increasingly harsh conditions, they need to rethink how they farm \u2013 from the soil up.</p><p>About 180 kilometres south of Jorge\u2019s farm, just outside the tiny cobblestoned hamlet of Assumar, Herberto Brunk is undertaking his own regenerative experiment. As he manoeuvres his black Peugeot truck up his long dirt driveway, he stops between two of his fields. On the left, Brunk has planted mixed grasses as ground cover. On the right is a thriving field dominated by buckwheat (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fagopyrum esculentum</emphasis>) with some millet, pumpkin and sunflowers mixed in. A few months later, after a dry summer, he decided not to harvest the buckwheat and to leave it as a cover crop instead. Kept intact, it has helped to prevent nitrogen from leaching out of the soil.</p><p>Much of the work Brunk is doing is aimed at improving the soil \u2014 the foundation for a healthy bottom line. \u201cOur main goal is to actually recover the soil, get our organic matter up, get our nutrients recycled and reduce as much as possible the erosion,\u201d Brunk says. He\u2019s already beginning to see some positive results: \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t have any erosion at all due to water.\u201d</p><p>Brunk is working to increase the amount of carbon stored in his farm\u2019s soil.</p><p>Close-up of a farmer holding healthy soil in his hands</p><p>Credit: Barbora Mrazkova</p><p>And Brunk says his farm is likely to be more resilient during wildfires. In August, as fires burnt across Portugal, he helped his neighbour, a cattle grower, to put out a fire. If it had reached Brunk\u2019s property, he says, it probably wouldn\u2019t have done much damage because the fields are green and well hydrated.</p><p>This is year three of Brunk\u2019s five-year plan, and he doesn\u2019t expect to see a profit for a while. But both Jorge and Brunk are hopeful that the eventual pay-off will be worth the wait. For them, the regenerative approach is not only a way to restore the soil \u2014 it\u2019s also good for business in the long run.</p><p>Improving the soil will help to retain water, protecting it from drought, says Brunk. He has also seen the amount of carbon in his soils increase from 1.9% in 2019 to 3.5% in 2024 \u2014 more than halfway to his goal of 6%. Under a new partnership with Terra Madre, a company based in Porto, Portugal, that helps farmers transition to regenerative agriculture, he will receive payments for increasing the amount of carbon stored in plants and the soil; companies buy carbon credits based on this sequestered carbon to offset their pollution.</p><p>The practices that Brunk and Jorge are deploying \u2014 planting cover crops, rotating crops, reducing tilling, integrating trees \u2014 can help to protect their farms against the vagaries of a changing climate, says Thomas Elmqvist, a sustainability scientist at the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm University. He co-wrote a 2022 report from the European Academies\u2019 Science Advisory Council on the state of regenerative agriculture in Europe. \u201cThere is fairly strong scientific evidence for the practices having an impact,\u201d he says.</p><p>For example, growing different crops on the same field in rotation can boost the number and types of microorganisms in the soil3. And a 2021 meta-analysis4 spanning 85 countries showed that diversifying crops in this way increased the biodiversity of other plants and animals by 24%. Growing a variety of crops brings a host of other benefits: the study also found the practice led to a 51% increase in water quality, a 63% boost in pest and disease control and an 11% spike in soil quality.</p><p>How farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool</p><p>A 2022 study5 using soil samples from 1,267 farm sites across Germany found that tripling the area used to grow cover crops could boost the amount of organic carbon added to the soil by 12% within 50 years.</p><p>When it comes to crop yields, the results are less clear. A 2019 review6, for example, found that using cover crops decreased grain production by 4%, but including legumes such as clover in the cover crop could increase yields by 13%.</p><p>Other studies show positive trends in terms of profitability for farmers. In June, Kr\u00e4mer\u2019s group released a multi-year analysis7 that looked at 78 farms across 14 European countries. The results, which have not been published in a scientific journal but were reviewed by agricultural experts across Europe, found that farms that had adopted regenerative practices used 61% less synthetic nitrogen and 75% less pesticides than did their conventional counterparts. Per hectare, regenerative farms also achieved a 20% higher margin (the difference between income and costs).</p><p>And a 2023 analysis of regenerative farms in Germany by Kr\u00e4mer and his co-authors \u2014 written for the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consultancy firm \u2014 reported that these operations should be at least 60% more profitable after six to ten years compared with conventional farms using other approaches.</p><p>But what works in one location might not work in another, Elmqvist says. \u201cMore long-term studies are needed to fully understand the sustainability and profitability of regenerative practices over multiple growing seasons, in different regions and under different climatic conditions,\u201d he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A push for reform</emphasis></p><p>On paper, at least, the EU has some of the world\u2019s most ambitious commitments to sustainable agriculture, several of which encourage a regenerative approach. But in practice, observers say, the bloc has struggled to deliver on those promises.</p><p>In 2020, after a brutal European heatwave in 2019, the EU committed to building a food system that \u201cworks for consumers, producers, climate and the environment\u201d. It had also launched its signature environmental law in 2019, the European Green Deal, which aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. And, last year, the bloc adopted a landmark nature-restoration law, which includes a requirement for member states to boost biodiversity on farmlands.</p><p>Reducing the amount of soil disturbance has helped Brunk to avoid erosion in his fields.</p><p>A farmer attaches an apparatus to the back of a green tractor in a grassy field</p><p>Credit: Barbora Mrazkova</p><p>The bloc now funds an initiative to help farmers to scale up regenerative practices and, in February, it unveiled a road map that calls for farmers to be compensated for increasing carbon storage, boosting biodiversity and providing other environmental benefits. If implemented, this should encourage more farmers to make the switch to regenerative agriculture, says Teresa Pinto Correia, a landscape ecologist at the University of \u00c9vora in Portugal, who served on a recent EU-funded task force for regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\u201cI think it will help,\u201d says Correia. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong economic argument.\u201d</p><p>The bloc is also moving to improve soil health, a central tenet of regenerative agriculture. In October, the European Parliament will vote on the first dedicated EU directive to call for having \u201call soils in a healthy condition\u201d by 2050.</p><p>At the same time, the EU is considering relaxing some environmental requirements for farmers as part of a larger effort by the European Commission to \u201clighten the regulatory load\u201d and boost the bloc\u2019s competitiveness in response to farmers\u2019 concerns. As the EU updates its agriculture policies, Kr\u00e4mer\u2019s group is urging officials to provide direct payments for \u2018ecosystem services\u2019, such as improved soil cover and reduced erosion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Making it pay</emphasis></p><p>Jorge is hopeful that his regenerative makeover will boost profitability, but he is also clear-eyed about the trade-offs. \u201cFirst, I have to think \u2018what is economically viable?\u2019\u201d he says.</p><p>Jorge says permanent payments for good practices would go a long way to ensuring profitability and encouraging more farmers to move to regenerative agriculture. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I think will happen in the future,\u201d but it is likely to involve a mix of government and private initiatives, he adds.</p><p>Right now, the only way that farmers can be paid for embracing regenerative practices is through programmes that trade carbon credits on the voluntary carbon market. Brunk has signed up with Terra Madre\u2019s carbon credits programme, but he says it\u2019s too early to know how much he will earn from it, because the credits are calculated on the basis of the increase in carbon sequestration over time.</p><p>Big food companies are also getting on the regenerative bandwagon. A collaboration involving businesses, governments and non-governmental organizations has channelled about $27.4 million to fund environmental improvements using regenerative practices on 289 farms in the United Kingdom, Hungary, Italy and Poland since 2021.</p><p>How to climate-proof crops: scientists say the secret\u2019s in the dirt</p><p>As regenerative practices gain favour, measuring results is increasingly important \u2014 both to validate claims of the approach\u2019s benefits and to ensure that farmers are compensated fairly for those benefits, says Mark Manshanden, an agricultural economist at Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands.</p><p>Climate Farmers, a group in Berlin that works across Europe to help advance the move to regenerative agriculture, has developed a set of indicators aimed at helping farmers know what to measure and to encourage standardization of measurement techniques.</p><p>Philippe Birker, co-founder of Climate Farmers, says that regenerative agriculture \u201cis the single most impactful solution we have to address not only the climate crisis that we\u2019re in, but also the underlying broken relationship that we have with nature\u201d.</p><p>In the long run, it will take concrete signs of success to convince more farmers in Europe and elsewhere to embrace regenerative agriculture.

Mr. Laranja began adopting the regenerative model on his dairy farm ten years ago. Under his guidance, the farm in Itirapina (SP) became the first in Brazil to achieve carbon-neutral milk certification, as well as certifications in organic production and animal welfare.</p><p>Five years ago, Mr. Laranja expanded his efforts to beef cattle production, which now spans 16,000 hectares, with over 6,000 hectares operating under a silvopastoral system across farms in Paranaita (MT), Anan\u00e1s (TO), S\u00e3o Bento do Tocantins (TO), and Barra (BA).</p><p>\u201cWe have developed intensive beef cattle production models that prioritize sustainable practices.

The company now operates on properties across S\u00e3o Paulo, Mato Grosso, Bahia, and Tocantins. While the cost of implementing regenerative systems is approximately R$8,000 to R$10,000 per hectare, Mr. Laranja notes that the results begin to show within three years. \u201cIt definitely comes with its challenges, but that\u2019s always been the case in farming.

The property spans 25 hectares, 11 of which are preserved native forest. Production is artisanal and small-scale, averaging 20 kilos of cheese per day.</p><p>A notable transformation on the farm is a spring that once ran dry but now flows steadily, contributing to the Araras Stream and the S\u00e3o Francisco River. \u201cThe diversity of plants, microorganisms, and pasture has also positively influenced the taste of the cheese, enriching the final product,\u201d he explains.</p><p>He also highlights the improved well-being of the dairy cattle, who benefit from the shade the trees and shrubs provide. \u201cThe soil has improved too, with an increase in organic matter and water absorption capacity,\u201d he adds.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is also aligned with the principles of the circular economy.

And it's getting higher and higher for Brazil. Data presented by Instituto Escolhas in the panel \"Why is the transition of the soybean production model crucial for Brazil?\" served as a starting point for a debate on the current state of agribusiness' main export item.</p><p><br/>Jaqueline Ferreira, Research Director at Instituto Escolhas, showed that producers currently use three times more pesticides and twice as much fertilizer to produce the same amount of soybeans as 30 years ago.<br/>According to the study produced by Escolhas, soybean production jumped from 23 million to 152 million tons in three decades - an increase of approximately 560%. Consumption of pesticides, meanwhile, exploded by 2,019% in the same period. The use of fertilizers, on the other hand, grew by 734%. Productivity per hectare, on the other hand, rose by only 61%, according to the Instituto Escolhas survey.<br/>Jaqueline Ferreira said that, as well as causing environmental degradation, the current model is inefficient from an economic point of view. According to her, producers are \"feeling the difficulties of an outdated system in their pockets\". \"In 1993, with one kilogram of pesticides, it was possible to produce 23 bags of soybeans. In 2023, the same amount of pesticide would only produce seven bags, which clearly costs the producer more,\" she said.<br/>Data from the National Supply Company (Conab) shows that spending on seeds, agrochemicals and fertilizers consumed 30% of the gross value of production in 2013 and that, by 2023, this percentage had risen to 44%.<br/>There is also the problem of dependence on imported inputs. More than 80% of fertilizers are imported, as are 60% of pesticides. Exchange rate and geopolitical fluctuations have a direct impact on production costs.<br/>\"Producers no longer use pesticides because they want to. It's expensive. They use it because they have to,\" explained the Instituto Escolhas researcher. \"We're talking about a monoculture model that reduces local biodiversity, degrades the soil and requires more and more inputs to deal with pests, weeds and diseases,\" she warned.<br/>Luis Barbieri, director of the Folio Institute, pointed to regenerative agriculture as a way to maintain productivity in a sustainable way. \"Today we have producers who have managed to eliminate 100% of chemical fungicides from their soybeans while maintaining high productivity and scale,\" he said.<br/>\"Rural producers who don't start this process now (switching to regenerative agriculture) will have solvency problems over the next decade, because this is a technological paradigm shift,\" Barbieri warned.<br/>Regenerative agriculture, based on bio-inputs and soil recovery, is emerging as an alternative to the productivity problems pointed out by the Escolhas study. The transition, however, is slow. Only 13% of the products registered with the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) are bio-inputs, compared to 87% that are highly toxic. \"There is a change taking place, but it needs to accelerate, otherwise we'll miss the boat,\" said the director of the Folio Institute.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Legal framework</emphasis><br/>The expansion of bio-inputs in the soy industry depends on regulatory advances. The regulation of bio-inputs was approved in 2024, after years of legal uncertainty. \"Producers who used bio-inputs were illegal and even subject to imprisonment,\" criticized Maur\u00edcio Buffon, president of Aprosoja Brasil. Even with the new law, 80% of farms have already experimented with some form of bio-input, according to Buffon. For the Aprosoja representative, the interest is there, but structural support is lacking.<br/>Jaqueline Ferreira also highlighted problems. She recalled that the National Fertilizer Plan allocates less than 1% of its resources to biofertilizers, investing mainly in the traditional chemical industry. \"We need to change the logic of public investment for this regenerative tropical agriculture,\" she said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Follow Correio's WhatsApp channel and receive the main news of the day on your cell phone</emphasis><br/>\"This culture diminishes local biodiversity, impacts on soil quality, requires more fertilizer and more pesticides.

This data challenge further complicates an already complex financial environment for climate tech, which is supported by a blend of public, philanthropic, and private funding.Specifically, Cisco Foundation's grants and investments, via the Regenerative Future Fund (RFF), support quality, open source, foundational data availability and innovative AI applications for climate through blended finance for the industry. Our latest blended finance engagements -with partners across regenerative agriculture and wildfire resilience - serve as case studies.</p><p><br/>Aligning capital and data to value regenerative agriculture practices<br/>U.S. farmers seeking to adopt regenerative agriculture practices face many challenges, such as limited access to capital and inadequate data infrastructure. In fact, the USDA has reported 21% and 17% declines in farm working capital in 2023 and 2024 respectively . These economic trends can limit farmers' ability to invest in regenerative transitions, and challenge long-term sustainability and growth.<br/>To address this, we provided investment capital to the Fractal Farmer Agriculture Regenerative Management (FARM) Fund , which introduced a pioneering financial model that supports farmers while maintaining their land control. Offering 10-year contracts inclusive of incentives tied to regenerative practice adoption, Fractal provides an alternative to conventional debt or majority equity funding structures.<br/>The success of this model is reflected in Fractal's work with 14 farms, which the organization says have reported a 6.5% higher crop yield compared to local benchmarks and maintained stronger income rates relative to market averages.<br/>For Jesse Hough, the general manager and financial strategist of Hough Farms in East Central Nebraska, Fractal's long term minority investment approach has helped him consistently outperform county yields. He can continue making on-farm decisions and, unlike short-term programs, Fractal supports regenerative practices for the full ten years, aligning incentives so both farmer and investor share in the long-term gains.<br/>Fractal uses AI and machine learning to analyze underlying land productivity and create more accurate land valuations for its investments. Its models incorporate climate risk and soil health, a more sophisticated approach than traditional static measures that can under- or overvalue a farm's long-term potential. For Fractal to continue to implement its work best and support farmers like Jesse, it needs improved data infrastructure to support underwriting and incentive processes for the company.<br/>To accelerate the development of these vital datasets, the Cisco Foundation also provided an early-stage cash grant to Earth Genome . Their new, open-source Open Ground initiative, developed in collaboration with Fractal, will integrate historical climate data, localized extreme weather models, and advanced crop failure classifications to deliver precise field-level insights. Their open access helps stakeholders like researchers, startups, insurers, lenders, and public good entities unlock the potential for AI applications in agriculture. It also helps them to confidently invest in, integrate and reward regenerative agricultural practices in their operations.<br/>The AI edge in wildfire management: Mapping a resilient future<br/>Another example of our blended finance approach is our support of Vibrant Planet and Vibrant Planet Data Commons to address wildfire and land management.<br/>Cisco Foundation's investee, Vibrant Planet PBC , operates on the core thesis that\"you can't understand what you can't see\"- a concept increasingly crucial as more extreme weather, outdated fire suppression policies, and fragmented restoration efforts make U.S. forests more susceptible to catastrophic wildfires.<br/>The lack of open-source, high-quality data has hindered restoration, management, and community engagement, and has especially excluded Indigenous stewardship and perspectives.<br/>Addressing these challenges requires advanced technology. Vibrant Planet leverages satellite imagery, remote sensing, AI-powered modeling, and cloud-based data integration to capture a comprehensive, real-time picture of forest health, fire risk, and ecosystem change with unmatched granularity.<br/>While these technologies enable the collection, analysis, and sharing of vast datasets -spanning millions of acres - they provide it at an incredibly localized level. This makes actionable insights and informed recommendations via their wildfire resilience platform available to land managers, scientists, and policymakers.<br/>Vibrant Planet Data Commons , the nonprofit arm of Vibrant Planet PBC, makes forest science and data meaningful and accessible to drive wildfire and ecosystem resilience. With Cisco Foundation grant support since 2022, they've built core infrastructure and released novel open-access data packages - including a wildfire ignition probability model -alongside story-driven tools for public engagement.<br/>Their work prioritizes Indigenous knowledge sharing, with protocols co-developed alongside Tribal partners. These packages are used by scientists and practitioners across the American West, with a growing focus on tracking how this knowledge informs management and infrastructure decisions.<br/>As Dr. Chelsey Walden-Schreiner, Director of Science Development at Vibrant Planet Data Commons shared,\"Together, Vibrant Planet PBC and VPDC form a hybrid engine for change - where science meets scalable systems, and where public good and market-driven innovation reinforce one another. Our success is not parallel, but interdependent - unlocking a model for how mission-aligned for-profits and nonprofits can co-create transformative climate resilience.\"<br/>Together, these examples illustrate how blended finance and open data can help inform AI-driven approaches to climate resilience, such as supporting more adaptive agricultural practices and informing forest management strategies.<br/>This blog was written with assistance from Ryan Jones, Cisco Chief Sustainability Office, TekSystems.<br/>View original content here .<br/>MENAFN12092025007202015466ID1110054498<br/></p>", "publisher": "MENAFN - Press Releases (English)", "instances": ["This data challenge further complicates an already complex financial environment for climate tech, which is supported by a blend of public, philanthropic, and private funding.

That is why we <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">systematized the 5,000 hectares with terraces, flat readers, internal canals and hydraulic structures.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">With a very heavy investment, between 2019 and 2023, we managed to recover areas that were waterlogged or weeded,\" </emphasis>Mateu explained.<br/>In the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3,000 hectares of</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Am\u00e9rica,</emphasis> the water table has a direct influence on productive management, which makes the area a very favorable environment. However, with drier winters, the level of double cropping does not reach the records of Arrecifes, although very high productivity and a good balance of organic matter throughout the year are still achieved. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Livestock, </emphasis>in this case, is developed mainly on the edges of lagoons and in the lowlands, with breeding and rebreeding on rye.<br/>Meanwhile, in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">12,000 hectares of Balcarce,</emphasis> divided into four subunits, they produce traditional crops and some specialties, such as malting barley.

Since the company settled in the country, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">we have maintained the cattle raising plans\", </emphasis>he indicated.<br/>Although the direct economic benefit provided by the program for participating in different practices is limited - around US$ 17 per hectare - the real value lies in the ecosystem services. \"The determining factor is the improvement in moisture management and logistics,\" he said.<br/>For <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alejandro Ramos Mej\u00eda,</emphasis> commercial manager of Garfin Agro, joining the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LDC program </emphasis>also has<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> a strategic value in the medium term.</emphasis> \"What adds up for us is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">basically</emphasis> to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">show it and have them help us measure it.</emphasis> Good practices are already part of the company's culture with our own measurement ratios, but doing it together with a multinational that needs these programs is a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">win-win</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">. </emphasis>They help us to show it as the end consumers want to see it, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">upstream in the chain,\"</emphasis> he explained.<br/>Ramos Mej\u00eda said that the company has an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">advanced track record in sustainability,</emphasis> but that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">there is always room for learning</emphasis>. \"The company has been producing sustainably for many years.

Our leases are set up and structured\u2026 to be six years in duration initially, and they can be evergreen thereafter,\" Chris Zuehlsdorff, CEO of Iroquois Valley, told EcoWatch. \"The main product that we offer farmers is what we call a purchase lease. So a farmer like Rex, for example, will identify a 200-acre farm that is down the road or that he would like to add to his portfolio and his business plan. And we'll buy that farm and lease it back to the farmer over a six-year term. So that gets them through the organic certification. After year six, [the leases] auto-renew for every two years. We also offer the farmer an opportunity to purchase the farm from us at the end of year six, should they want to.\"</p><p>Last year, Iroquois Valley distributed $37 million from investors to 18 farmers.</p><p>\"Rex is a good example of a farmer in our portfolio. We first did a purchase of a farm for him and his family back in 2020, and he successfully transitioned that farm\u2026 to certified organic production,\" Zuehlsdorff told EcoWatch. \"He's looking to grow his operation \u2014 his acreage portfolio, if you will \u2014 and so he identified this opportunity late last year to purchase another farm, and he brought that opportunity to us.\"</p><p>Organic wheat, soy and corn will be grown on Wettstein's farm, but it will also become the first Iroquois Valley partner to invest in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/renewable-energy-carbon-capture-climate-solution.html\">renewable energy</url>.</p><p>\"For us, it is the first investment in our portfolio that has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/wind-turbine-repurposed-tiny-home.html\">wind turbines</url> on it.

But that was what inspired them to begin to explore solutions,\" Zuehlsdorff told EcoWatch. \"And the one solution that they came up with was to buy a farm in Iroquois County, Illinois \u2014 hence the name, Iroquois Valley \u2014 and convert that farm to organic, to get chemicals out of the food system, to just try to make a small impact on outcomes in the environment.\"</p><p>That was the first farm Iroquois Valley purchased, but now their model is one of partnership with farmers.</p><p>\"Harold Wilkins would have been the first farmer in our portfolio in Iroquois County, Illinois, that they worked with to transition\u2026 to certified organic production. And then maybe 18 months later, they bought another farm in the same area. And by 2012, they [had] created a small LLC,\" Zuehlsdorff explained. \"[They] continued raising capital and buying and converting farmland to organic. And then in 2016, they converted the fund to the structure that it is today, which is a real estate investment trust and a public benefit corporation\u2026 And what I really like is we really democratize access for individuals and for people to own a diversified portfolio of organic farmland.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Firoquoisvalley%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0TSDbK1LNJbKmUFY9ZHEEuTCdtUswUZmxJixSf5EZniZut5VhvnKKq3eGgx1VDgJnl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500\">https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Firoquoisvalley%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0TSDbK1LNJbKmUFY9ZHEEuTCdtUswUZmxJixSf5EZniZut5VhvnKKq3eGgx1VDgJnl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500</url></p><p>In 2000, the amount of certified organic land being used for agriculture or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/carbon-sequestration-soil-livestock-emissions.html\">livestock</url> in the United States was 1.8 million acres, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2023/november/rising-consumer-demand-reshapes-landscape-for-u-s-organic-farmers#:~:text=In%20the%20two%20decades%20since,toward%20development%20of%20organic%20agriculture.\">U.S Department of Agriculture</url>.

And then, ultimately, it's about creating demand for organic produce, organic grown crops,\" Zuehlsdorff said. \"So the more awareness we can create amongst the consumer in the buying community and the more demand that's out there, the supply side is going to respond. And so that's a very important piece to the puzzle, I think, is to feel more connected to the food [we] eat and where it's grown and how it's grown.\"</p><p>Zuehlsdorff said he sees organic farming continuing to expand for the health of water, soil, humans and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/wallis-annenberg-wildlife-crossing-soil.html\">wildlife</url>.</p><p>\"We started farming organically 60, 70 years ago, before we started putting chemicals on fields en masse. And I think we absolutely have to continue to transition more acres from conventional to organic and regenerative practices,\" Zuehlsdorff told EcoWatch. \"For us, organic certification is the baseline, and then all of the regenerative practices that farmers can do on top of that \u2014 cover crops and crop rotations and integrating livestock, buffer strips for biodiversity \u2014 whatever that may be, is added on top of that core organic certification, which is our baseline. Our vision is to transform agriculture through organic land stewardship, and we feel like we have one generation to do that. That's our goal.

Through Open Ground, we're partnering with Earth Genome to make the climate and agronomic data behind those benefits open source - ensuring it can drive meaningful impact across the entire sector.\" - Dr. Emma Fuller, Co-Founder, Fractal</p><p>To accelerate the development of these vital datasets, the Cisco Foundation also provided an early-stage cash grant to Earth Genome. Their new, open-source Open Ground initiative, developed in collaboration with Fractal, will integrate historical climate data, localized extreme weather models, and advanced crop failure classifications to deliver precise field-level insights. Their open access helps stakeholders like researchers, startups, insurers, lenders, and public good entities unlock the potential for AI applications in agriculture. It also helps them to confidently invest in, integrate and reward regenerative agricultural practices in their operations.</p><p>The AI edge in wildfire management: Mapping a resilient future</p><p>Another example of our blended finance approach is our support of Vibrant Planet and Vibrant Planet Data Commons to address wildfire and land management.</p><p>Cisco Foundation's investee, Vibrant Planet PBC, operates on the core thesis that \"you can't understand what you can't see\" - a concept increasingly crucial as more extreme weather, outdated fire suppression policies, and fragmented restoration efforts make U.S. forests more susceptible to catastrophic wildfires.</p><p>The lack of open-source, high-quality data has hindered restoration, management, and community engagement, and has especially excluded Indigenous stewardship and perspectives.</p><p>Addressing these challenges requires advanced technology. Vibrant Planet leverages satellite imagery, remote sensing, AI-powered modeling, and cloud-based data integration to capture a comprehensive, real-time picture of forest health, fire risk, and ecosystem change with unmatched granularity.</p><p>While these technologies enable the collection, analysis, and sharing of vast datasets -spanning millions of acres - they provide it at an incredibly localized level. This makes actionable insights and informed recommendations via their wildfire resilience platform available to land managers, scientists, and policymakers.</p><p>Vibrant Planet Data Commons, the nonprofit arm of Vibrant Planet PBC, makes forest science and data meaningful and accessible to drive wildfire and ecosystem resilience. With Cisco Foundation grant support since 2022, they've built core infrastructure and released novel open-access data packages - including a wildfire ignition probability model -alongside story-driven tools for public engagement.</p><p>Their work prioritizes Indigenous knowledge sharing, with protocols co-developed alongside Tribal partners. These packages are used by scientists and practitioners across the American West, with a growing focus on tracking how this knowledge informs management and infrastructure decisions.</p><p>As Dr. Chelsey Walden-Schreiner, Director of Science Development at Vibrant Planet Data Commons shared, \"Together, Vibrant Planet PBC and VPDC form a hybrid engine for change - where science meets scalable systems, and where public good and market-driven innovation reinforce one another. Our success is not parallel, but interdependent - unlocking a model for how mission-aligned for-profits and nonprofits can co-create transformative climate resilience.\"</p><p>Together, these examples illustrate how blended finance and open data can help inform AI-driven approaches to climate resilience, such as supporting more adaptive agricultural practices and informing forest management strategies.</p><p>This blog was written with assistance from Ryan Jones, Cisco Chief Sustainability Office, TekSystems.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:</p><p>Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc</url></p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________ Closing price for CSCO-Q Date : 2025/09/11 Price: 67.69</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2025 Market News Publishing Inc.

A study published by the Instituto Escolha shows that the model is also inefficient, causing damage to both the environment and the economy.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Follow Correio's WhatsApp channel and receive the main news of the day on your cell phone</emphasis><br/>The study, \"Brazil as world leader in soybean production: until when and at what cost?\", compares figures for soybean production in 1993 and 2023, and proves the rise in costs for soybean producers, such as the increase in the use of chemical inputs to produce the same number of bags of soybeans and the disproportionate growth in the price of agrochemicals and fertilizers for soybeans.<br/>According to the survey, in 2023, farmers produced fewer bags of soybeans (60 kg) with the same amount of pesticides as in 1993. With 1 kilo of chemicals in 1993, the farmer produced 23 bags, while in 2023 productivity drops to just 7 bags. The same goes for the use of fertilizers: with 1 ton, in 1993, the worker produced 517 bags of soybeans, in 2023 the number was reduced to 333.<br/>For rural producer Marion Kompier, Brazil doesn't need to expand the area planted with soya any further, it just needs to use the degraded pasture areas, which have enough space to accommodate soya, and increase irrigation systems throughout Brazil. That would be enough to increase production to supply the planet.<br/>\"It's like comparing it to a sick person, who takes a chemical medicine from the pharmacy, that medicine can give a side effect, that we will need to take another medicine to solve that side effect. It's a snowball. We use more and more medicine,\" he says.<br/>\"The producer's profit margin is much smaller, because we need to use more and more chemicals and fertilizers to try to correct the imbalances that we ourselves have caused with this current model of agriculture,\" he adds.<br/>According to the survey, Brazil is the world leader in the use of pesticides and fertilizers (phosphorus and potassium), accounting for 22% of the global volume of pesticides in agriculture. However, even with a large volume of chemical inputs, the country also stands out for its inefficient use per hectare of cultivated land (all crops), among the five largest soy producers in the world (Argentina, Brazil, China, the United States and India), being the worst among the five in the use of pesticides per hectare and the second worst in the use of fertilizers per hectare.<br/>Transgenics<br/>According to Croplife - representing the world's leading soybean seed companies - the adoption of transgenic seeds in soybean production in Brazil is almost absolute, representing 93% of the total by 2023. The adoption of this technology promised to promote efficiency in pest control in transgenic crops and a reduction in the use of agrochemicals, but unfortunately the promise has not been fulfilled. The study shows that the volume of pesticides used is growing faster than the volume of seed production and soybean production. The 20-year analysis shows an increase of 660% in the use of agrochemicals, 348% in seed production and, for grain production, a smaller increase of 256%.<br/>According to Marion Kompier, genetically modified cultivars are chemically dependent. \"They were produced to respond with productivity when a lot of chemicals were applied. So today they are not tolerant to pests and diseases, to climatic difficulties. They're not suitable for reducing the amount of chemicals we'd like,\" she adds.<br/>The sum of the average spending on these three inputs per hectare/year in the rural enterprises evaluated by Conab went from 68% (R$1,630/ha/year) of total costing expenses (R$2,385/ha/year) in 2013 to 87% (R$3,487/ha/year) of total costing expenses (R$4,015/ha/year) in 2023.<br/>An economic factor highlighted by the research is the discrepancy between the price increase of the inputs used in planting and that of the soybean itself. As an example, the price evolution of the herbicide Glyphosate 480 grams, an agrochemical used in soybean cultivation, whose annual national average price per liter increased by 99% between 2013 and 2023, reaching a value (corrected) of R$52.62 in 2023.Meanwhile, during this same period, the price of a 60kg bag of soybeans increased by only 2%, reaching a value of R$153.40 in 2023.<br/>The study reveals a series of problems and difficulties that Brazilian producers face due to the excessive use of chemical inputs, the price of which is detrimental to the farmer's economy.<br/>For the farmer, it is necessary to honor and thank the production model that has brought Brazilian agriculture to the top of the world, but the time has come to look at a new way of production, regenerative agriculture. \"We need research to work to show how to validate, how to do it, which way to go, whether what producers are doing is right or wrong. We're learning this way, but we still know very little, but the little we do know is already making a big difference to our production,\" he says.<br/>Kompier also points out that many producers are already looking for solutions, such as the Associated Group for Sustainable Agriculture (Gaas). They already see that this current model is unsustainable for both nature and the economy and they need to find a new way of farming. For more farmers to adopt the regenerative agriculture model, more research is needed.<br/>\"Here's a call for research institutions to research this new model of regenerative agriculture and provide data that will teach and show farmers how to do it.  For agronomy schools, they also need to open up to this path and teach new producers, students, that there is another model for farming, that it's not just the model with synthetic fertilizers and chemical products, that there is this model of regenerative agriculture,\" he adds.<br/>On September 2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Correio</emphasis> will hold an event in its auditorium, in partnership with Instituto Escolhas, to discuss the possible paths to a model that respects the soil, the producer and the planet - without sacrificing productivity.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             By Caetano Yamamoto       </p>", "publisher": "CE Noticias Financieras English", "instances": ["40 in 2023.

The partnership emphasizes a farm-wide approach that aims to improve soil health, manage water resources effectively, and enhance agricultural resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The collaborative effort involves integrating regenerative practices into rotational agriculture, where farmers alternate different crops, including cereals, legumes, and cover crop blends, each season. ADM serves as an implementation partner, providing financial and technical resources to support farmers transitioning to these sustainable practices. Participants in the program will benefit from training and guidance from technical specialists, including support from Biospheres.</p><p>Mars Inc. and its partners are incentivizing farmers financially based on the sustainable practices they implement, such as conservation tillage and cover cropping. Paul Gardner, lead global commercial VP at Mars Inc., stated, 'Through this pre-competitive collaboration, Mars, PepsiCo, and ADM are working together to help tackle the climate impacts of the agricultural supply chain.' He emphasized that by working across shared crop rotations, the partnership can empower farmers to adopt climate-smart practices that enhance soil health and build farm resilience over the long term.</p><p>To measure the impact of these initiatives, the companies plan to utilize the Cool Farm Tool, a sustainability calculator designed to help farmers assess and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The data collected through this program will not only inform the effectiveness of the current initiatives but may also guide potential expansion into other markets, reinforcing Mars Inc.'s commitment to sustainability in the food industry.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: POUL WEIHRAUCH CEO &amp; President</p><p>SECTION 2 MARS, INCORPORATED PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 3 MARS, INCORPORATED TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 4 MARS, INCORPORATED RANKING</p><p>SECTION 5 MARS, INCORPORATED PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 6 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 7 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: POUL WEIHRAUCH CEO &amp; President</p><p>In September 2022, Poul Weihrauch took over the position of CEO and Office of the President for Mars. \u200b</p><p>Poul has spent more than 20 years with Mars and is known for his commitment to Associates and merging purpose, sustainability and strategy to drive growth, performance and positive impact.   \u200b</p><p>He has been President of Mars Petcare since 2014, leading the evolution from its origins in pet food into a true pet care company, making Mars the world's largest provider of veterinary services and doubling the size of the business.
