Climate action must serve people, especially those most exposed to environmental and structural vulnerabilities. This is what climate justice truly means. Not just protection, but empowerment. When we design policies that are inclusive and forward-looking, we turn climate mitigation and adaptation into engines of growth, resilience and opportunity. It's not just about reducing emissions. It's about building a future that works for everyone.\"</p><p>Adri Pols, CEO of Desolenator, said: \"Climate change is intensifying the global challenge of food and water scarcity, and we cannot afford to treat these issues in isolation. Agriculture already consumes 70% of the world's freshwater, and extreme weather will only deepen the crisis. But solutions exist. From renewable-powered desalination to circular resource systems and innovations in controlled-environment agriculture, we have the tools to build resilience. What we need now is collaboration across borders and sectors to secure sustainable food and water systems for future generations.\"</p><p>During WGES 2025, prominent decision-makers, officials, experts, innovators and representatives from government entities, the private sector and the academic community worldwide will explore the disproportionate effects of climate change on vulnerable communities, particularly in relation to health, food security and access to water.

The legislation builds upon Supervisor Mandelman's All-Electric New Construction Ordinance and continues the Board President's commitment to a safer, healthier, and more sustainable San Francisco. Under this ordinance, major renovation building projects must go all-electric, improving public health and safety and reducing emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We can't build the San Francisco of the future with a fuel from the past,\" said Board of Supervisors President, Rafael Mandelman. \"This legislation picks up where we left off with the All-Electric New Construction ordinance and affords us the opportunity to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in our existing buildings, improve indoor and outdoor air quality, and make San Francisco a safer, healthier, and more resilient place to live and work. Choosing clean energy is how we build the clean, all-electric City of the future.\"</p><p>Building operations are responsible for nearly half of San Francisco's emissions. Most of these emissions stem from the combustion of methane, more commonly referred to as natural gas, in existing buildings. The combustion of this super pollutantfor heating, cooling, and other building functionsposes significant threats to humans and the planet. In addition to impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health, natural gas-powered fixtures further exacerbate the climate crisis, increase the risk of fire during earthquakes, and take significantly longer to get back up and running after seismic events.</p><p>\"This ordinance protects the health and safety of San Franciscans by phasing out outdated gas systems in major renovations,\" said Tyrone Jue, Director of the San Francisco Environment Department. \"It reduces indoor air pollution, strengthens building safety, and ensures our infrastructure is ready for a cleaner, more resilient future. And as we make our homes safer, we're also cutting the pollution that fuels the climate crisis because in San Francisco protecting people and protecting the planet go hand in hand.\"</p><p>\"San Francisco is leading the charge towards building a green future for our city,\" said Supervisor Bilal Mahmood. \"Large-scale renovations offer an opportunity to reduce our City's reliance on fossil fuels, shrink our carbon footprint, and ensure a more sustainable future for all.\"</p><p>Mechanical systems in existing buildings are customarily upgraded or replaced for many reasons, including deterioration, building expansion, energy efficiency improvements, or building conversions. Targeting gas-powered systems at this point, when the project scope also includes major construction, is the most efficient and inexpensive way to electrify. By requiring buildings undergoing major renovations, a very high bar in the building code, to be rebuilt all-electric, the new ordinance helps San Francisco decarbonize its existing building stock in the most cost-effective way.</p><p>\"Building decarbonization is essential if we are going to have a fighting chance against climate change,\" said Supervisor Jackie Fielder. \"I am proud that San Francisco is showing leadership on this important environmental issue by expanding our building decarbonization requirements to include major renovations.\"</p><p>San Francisco is already going all-electric. The City's successful Climate Equity Hub has completed 26 projects/installs and has 45 in progress, targeting lower-income families with cost-free electric appliance installations. Affordable housing projects like Casa Adelante, Maceo May, 400 China Basin, and Transbay 2 West senior housing have been built all-electric, providing the community with healthier, safer, all-electric buildings. And the renovation of a small residential project in the Mission District by the Mission Economic Development Association (MEDA) has replaced gas appliances with all-electric ones in both the existing building and in its new additions. In fact, throughout the State, the vast majority of new construction projects are all-electric.</p><p>The ordinance is the result of over two years of planning and outreach. Engaged stakeholders include the Building Operations Task Force, developers, nonprofits, tenants' rights organizations, contractors, unions, and professional/housing associations.

This reflects a shift in priorities toward sustainable, low-emission energy sources, especially in light of increasing energy demand from data centres and artificial intelligence (AI), and the global pursuit of carbon neutrality. Through the World Green Economy Summit, which brings together decision-makers, thought leaders and global experts, we help to accelerate the adoption of clean and renewable energy by facilitating dialogue between the public and private sectors, financial institutions and international organisations in key areas such as clean energy, sustainable finance and green technology. This platform supports effective partnerships, stimulates innovation and shares best practices to achieve a sustainable future for us and generations to come,\" said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD and CEO of DEWA and Chairman of WGEO.</p><p>Role of AI in energy transition</p><p>Commenting on the key role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the energy sector, Dr Amalia Pantazidis, President of Lummus Consultants International and one of the speakers at WGES 2025, said AI has the potential to transform every aspect of the energy transition.</p><p>\"With AI, we can optimise the performance of key sectors of the energy value chain - including renewable power, refining and petrochemical production - to make complex, carbon-intensive industrial operations more sustainable.

At Lummus, we are integrating AI and digital solutions to help our customers unlock new levels of energy efficiency, waste reduction, resilience and lower emissions,\" said Dr Pantazidis.</p><p>Jessica Scopacasa, co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer of Olive Gaea and one of the speakers at WGES 2025, said: \"Climate urgency is rising, and action must follow. AI offers a powerful path to accelerate decarbonisation and make sustainability a true source of value - not just a reporting exercise. But we must build and use it ethically, transparently and with long-term impact in mind.\"</p><p>Stwart Pea Feliz, co-founder and CEO of MacroCycle Technologies, said: \"Circularity can only be achieved by bringing together all the stakeholders across the value chain. This event is a monumental opportunity to engage in fruitful conversations to achieve an economical pathway towards true circularity.\"</p><p>Green hydrogen</p><p>Green hydrogen also supports energy storage and cross-border transport, enhancing energy security and diversification. Seen as a new economic engine, green hydrogen has the potential to transform supply chains, industry and energy systems, offering strong export opportunities for producing countries. The UAE's National Hydrogen Strategy 2050, launched in 2023, aims to establish the country as a regional production and export hub by 2031, targeting 1.4 million tonnes of annual production, including one million tonnes of green hydrogen. This will be achieved through investment promotion, infrastructure development, R&amp;D and international partnerships.</p><p>Elie Adaimy Group Director Business Development, Technology &amp; Innovation at Gulf Cryo Group and one of the speakers at WGES 2025, said: \"Green hydrogen has captured global imagination - but imagination alone won't decarbonise heavy industry or fuel our future. To move from MoUs to megawatts, and to start building a new energy economy, we must move from pilot projects to scalable deployment, with bold policy, bankable offtake agreements and regional co-operation, turning ambition into reality.\"</p><p>The role of critical minerals in energy transition</p><p>Minerals are vital to the manufacture of energy transition technologies such as batteries, wind turbines and solar panels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that by 2040, lithium demand could increase over 40 times, while graphite, cobalt and nickel may grow 20-25 times, compared to 2020, and copper demand is expected to more than double. This shift highlights the need for sustainable supply chains that ensure responsible resource extraction. Green hydrogen also plays a key role in decarbonising emission-intensive sectors such as heavy industry and transport. As a zero-emission fuel produced via electrolysis from renewable sources, it is gaining traction among governments and global companies.</p><p>Energy storage</p><p>Another crucial aspect is energy storage, which ensures grid stability amid a growing reliance on intermittent sources such as solar and wind. The IEA's net-zero emissions scenario shows global grid-scale storage capacity grew from 10 GW in 2020 to 28 GW in 2022, and is expected to reach 967 GW by 2030, driven by advances in battery technology, falling costs and smart grid development. Storage technologies enable renewable integration and improve energy access in remote areas, with lithium-ion and grid-scale batteries central to achieving net-zero goals.</p><p>WGES role</p><p>WGES facilitates strategic discussions among decision-makers, investors, academic institutions and international organisations.

It provides loan guarantees and grants to help farmers and rural small businesses cover the cost of energy efficiency projects including solar, wind and biogas-to-electricity systems. It's funded more than 22,000 projects in all 50 states, according to the Environmental Law and Policy Center. It's had bipartisan support in Congress, and funding has gone heavily toward Republican-leaning districts, given their dominance in rural areas. In recent years, small solar energy projects that reduce operating costs for farms and businesses have received the bulk of funding. But some funding has gone to manure digesters that create electricity, to grain-drying systems and to small wind energy systems. Trump has made his distaste for solar and large-scale wind energy obvious and earlier this year called wind turbines \"garbage in a field.\" The trouble for REAP now is in the $2 billion plus-up Congress gave the program in the Inflation Reduction Act to be spent over a decade, and potentially in the program's embrace of energy sources that aren't necessarily in line with the Trump administration's emphasis on fossil fuels. For last year's round of funding, the USDA encouraged applicants to advance priorities including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building resiliency against the changing climate, as well as \"advancing racial justice, place-based equity and opportunity,\" according to the Federal Register notice from Oct. 16. The notice added that projects with climate benefits such as zero-emissions goals could receive a 50 percent federal cost share, while biogas-to-energy projects would be eligible for a smaller cost share of 25 percent. The USDA news release said refocusing the program would steer money away from \"harmful DEIA and far-left climate features\" in project proposals. The environmental group Earthjustice accused the administration of changing the program's rules on farmers and businesses that already made investments based on the awards. \"The only 'opportunity' for farmers in USDA's disingenuous stunt is to formally deny already awarded grant funds instead of withholding them indefinitely,\" said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice. \"Farmers have taken on loans and spent thousands of dollars to install solar panels and pursue energy efficiency upgrades because they believed they would be paid back in line with their REAP agreement.\" Vizcarra added, \"President Trump and Secretary Rollins can't change the rules of the game well into the second half. This is the definition of an arbitrary and capricious catch-22.\"</p>", "publisher": "Greenwire", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 23, "title": "Trump blames bureaucrats, NGOs for grant crackdown", "published": "2025-08-08", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Robin Bravender President Donald Trump moved to tighten his grip on government spending this week with an executive order directing his political appointees to vet all federal grants. The move marks a noteworthy shift from past administrations, where civil servants have played major roles in dishing out the federal government's vast grant spending. That was done in part to avoid the appearance of political appointees playing favorites, according to former government officials. But after months of the Trump 2.0 team slashing spending across the federal government, the administration said concentrating grantmaking authority with political appointees will stop \"unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats from wasting taxpayer dollars.\" </p><p>The Trump executive order issued Thursday directs each agency head to designate a senior appointee to create a new process to review funding announcements and to renew discretionary grants to ensure that they're \"consistent with agency priorities and the national interest.\" The order aims to give political appointees more direct control over a sizable chunk of federal spending. In fiscal 2024, the federal government spent $1.1 trillion just on state and local government grants to fund programs including environmental protection and education. The Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency boasts on its website that it has terminated more than 15,000 government grants worth about $44 billion since January. The administration \"has already terminated many wasteful grants,\" the White House said in a fact sheet. The executive order, it says, \"helps ensure that bureaucrats can't make the same mistakes in the future.\" A 'significant departure' Trump assailed a series of grant recipients in his executive order as evidence that the process was broken, including programs that funded \"drag shows in Ecuador, trained doctoral candidates in critical race theory, and developed transgender-sexual-education programs.\" Federal grants have also gone to \"non-governmental organizations that provided free services to illegal immigrants, worsening the border crisis and compromising our safety, and to organizations that actively worked against American interests abroad,\" the executive order says. Agency bosses across the Trump administration have spent months touting cuts to federal grants and contracts inked by the Biden administration. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin declared earlier this year that the \"days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left, activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.\" Zeldin on Thursday announced that his agency would terminate $7 billion in grants to help states, nonprofits and territories bring solar power to low-income communities. The National Science Foundation has announced the cancellations by 57 percent. The Trump administration's crackdown on grant approvals marks a \"significant departure\" from how the process has worked previously, said Matthew Tejada, a former senior career EPA staffer who led the agency's environmental justice office. \"I can't name a grant program that did not have political appointee involvement, but there were varying levels of that involvement, depending on the size and scope and gravity of the program,\" said Tejada, who's now a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Political appointees in the past have sought to avoid the appearance that they were meddling in the grantmaking process, Tejada said. He called Trump's approach an \"ineffective, unrealistic way of governing\" that will ultimately slow down the grantmaking process. \"The bureaucracy exists to help facilitate government working effectively and efficiently, and this is going in the opposite direction,\" Tejada said.</p>", "publisher": "Greenwire", "instances": ["Federal grants have also gone to \"non-governmental organizations that provided free services to illegal immigrants, worsening the border crisis and compromising our safety, and to organizations that actively worked against American interests abroad,\" the executive order says.

Retreat of the United States (US) from the Paris Climate Accord and the upsurge in global environmental trade measures like EU carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAM) have worsened the already paralysed global climate governance. CBAM, a controversial trade protection measure, can significantly distort the global trade order and alter the industrial practices of developing countries in their effort towards industrial decarbonisation and global trade competitiveness. Premised as a mechanism to plug the carbon leakage that may spill from the EU to other countries, as the latter have lax domestic emission standards, the mechanism projects to accelerate the decarbonisation efforts across countries through the imposition of carbon prices on exports to the EU.</p><p>For instance, while the EU's carbon price hovered around &amp;#8364;80-100 per ton of CO2, in most of the other parts of the world, it remains below &amp;#8364;10 per ton, which could be a major factor driving the relocation of the emission-intensive industries away from the EU. To start with, the mechanism aims to cover six high-emission intense sectors: cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen, aiming at minimising the significant risk of carbon leakage from the EU region.</p><p>Going against the current of multilateralism</p><p>CBAM is espoused by many countries like Brazil, China, and India as a trade barrier and is touted as a unilateral measure by EU. It is argued as a strategically designed protectionist measure by the EU, defying the principles of multilateralism and violating the norms of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Trade experts argue that CBAM is in contradiction with the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clause under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Article I, which calls for equal treatment for \"like\" products from all WTO members. CBAM, by levying differential tariffs on different products based on the embedded carbon content of the product, breaches the WTO clause of MFN. In addition, the design principle of CBAM is also in conflict with the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities - Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) principle of UNFCCC, which is considered central to international climate negotiations and driving global climate governance architecture. At the heart of the CBDR-RC principle lies the differential responsibility of nation states to address climate issues based on the differences in their historical emissions, current capabilities, and developmental priorities of countries. However, CBAM, which levies uniform carbon costs irrespective of developing countries' emission positions and economic capabilities, undermines the very core of the CBDR principle. By doing so, it adversely impacts the climate governance order, which has already been fractured due to several other reasons.</p><p>Breaking the core norms of international climate finance funds flow</p><p>Apart from the above, the CBAM, by its design, has provisions to mobilise financial resources for the EU and its member countries. The architecture of such a regulatory measure has made explicit provision for generating revenue through CBAM for the EU and its member countries. Revenue potential estimates indicate that CBAM could mobilise more than $80 billion per year till 2040.</p><p>The quantum of the revenue would be dependent on the purchase of CBAM certificates by the EU importers based on the magnitude of embedded emissions of carbon-intensive goods. The price of these certificates would be indexed to the weekly average auction price of EU-ETS allowances to ensure that the importers pay a carbon tariff equivalent to the tariff paid by the EU domestic producers. Starting from the definitive phase of 2026, the revenue collection would be part of the EU's general budget scheme and would be considered as its 'own resource', of which 3/4th will be part of the EU budget, and the remaining will be allocated to EU member states. The funds collected through selling CBAM certificates are intended to further the EU climate goals reinforced through various policy initiatives such as 'fit for 55'.</p><p>Though the specific allocation plan for the revenue to be mobilised through CBAM is yet to get a definitive direction, however, it is caught in controversy due to various reasons. Some stakeholders favour directing these resources to meet the domestic industrial decarbonisation efforts, while others demand diverting a portion of the funds to support developing countries' climate efforts. Nothing concrete so far has emerged as a formal agreement in deciding the allocation of such resources to developing countries' climate actions, though pressure to allocate such funds to developing countries is escalating over time from a climate equity point of view. CBAM in its current form not only curtails the trade competitiveness of developing countries' exports but also poses an additional financial burden for the developing countries through the imposition of such a tax on their exported products. Unless a proper redistribution mechanism is explicitly integrated with the revenue framework of CBAM, it would lead to so-called \"double whammy\" effects for developing countries like India.</p><p>India's CBAM exposure and the need for a managed transition</p><p>CBAM will reshape India and EU trade dynamics. The exposure is concentrated, with iron and steel forming 76.83 per cent of India's CBAM-affected exports. Compliance costs and margin pressure will hit these sectors first. Without a managed glide path that provides time, tools, and finance, firms risk losing price competitiveness and market share even as they invest to cut emissions.</p><p>Fairness and effectiveness must align. Developing countries need a phased adaptation window. The European Union should recycle CBAM revenues to fund capacity building and technology transfer. An equity-based adjustment should reflect historical responsibility, trade benefits, and development needs.</p><p>Gopal K.

On the stage, a lively guest preacher, Ronzel Pretlow, roused the congregation in the Hayward, California, church, his raspy voice rising and falling as he sang and shouted, prompting his audience to stand. When the excitement waned, he shifted their attention to Glad Tidings' founder, Bishop Jerry Macklin, seated in the pulpit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think we owe our Bishop another round of applause for leading us into innovation and creativity,\" the preacher said, eliciting a jingle from the organist. \"I'm going back home to see if I've got room for some electric vehicle chargers,\" he joked, knowing the profit that the chargers the church would soon have up and running could bring.</p><p>In September, Glad Tidings will complete its new Community Decarbonization Hub-a multipurpose campus featuring a 13,000-square-foot solar-powered building with battery storage and ten EV charging stations. The project, which started four years ago and has a $4.3 million price tag, won't only cut the church's energy usage and costs-it's expected to generate around $500,000 annually. And in five to seven years, as more people charge their vehicles at the church, that amount is projected to double.\u00a0</p><p>Glad Tidings isn't the only Black church in the Bay Area undergoing this kind of transformation. It's one of four, thanks to a partnership with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenthechurch.org/\">Green the Church</url>, an Oakland-based environmental justice nonprofit founded by Reverend Ambrose Carroll, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.geminiesolutions.com/\">Gemini Energy Solutions</url>, a cleantech company founded by Stanford University graduate Anthony Kinslow. The hubs Carroll and Kinslow are helping to build won't only bring clean energy infrastructure to these churches, but also turn them into year-round resilience hubs, ready to support residents when a disaster hits-be it a power outage, wildfire or heatwave.</p><p>As climate change progresses and brings more frequent extreme weather events, resilience hubs are becoming increasingly necessary-especially in Black and low-income communities, where legacies of redlining and other forms of racial discrimination have left residents particularly vulnerable. These communities are often the last to receive access to affordable, energy-efficient technology. Still, they persevere through brutal temperatures, hurricanes and other weather disasters, frequently earning praise from political leaders and news media for their resilience.</p><p>\"Resiliency isn't enough,\" Kinslow said. \"Resiliency implies maintaining where you're at, but I would think most of us would agree that the current baseline isn't where we want it to be. Communities need to be generating their own money to implement their own decarbonization projects.\"</p><p>Black churches don't just need money for decarbonization, but for their basic survival. Across the country, their congregations are shrinking due to aging populations and a larger generational shift away from religion, according to a Gallup <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx\">study</url>. Unable to rely on tithes and offerings, church leaders are under pressure to find new ways to maintain their buildings-their largest economic assets-and cut costs. Clean energy offers them a way to keep thriving.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923IbDakNaE&amp;t=21s\">Bishop Macklin</url> began building his ministry in the late 1970s, when South Hayward was troubled by \"drugs, crime, and rampant poverty,\" according to the church's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gladtidingscogic.org/about-us\">website</url>. Called a \"visionary\" by many in his circle, about 30 years ago, Bishop Macklin established the Glad Tidings Community Development Corporation (CDC), a separate entity from the church, to help area residents access essential resources, such as food, healthcare and affordable housing. Between the church and the CDC, they've acquired enough buildings to cover half a city block.</p><p>At the church's north campus, directly across from the main sanctuary, the new resilience hub features a 5,000-square-foot gymnasium, an exercise room, a STEM lab, a youth lounge, a kitchen and classrooms. Powered by solar energy, the building can accommodate over 500 people in an emergency, providing them with electricity, as well as air conditioning and filtered air. The church will add six EV charging stations to a sliver of parking lot between the resilience hub and the main sanctuary, which will also be equipped with solar panels this fall.</p><p>According to Benita McLarin, who leads the Glad TidingsCDC, her team has spent the past six months training a 15-person Community Response Team on fire safety, CPR and mental health first aid. \"Bishop Macklin is well respected and people look to him always for answers,\" said McLarin, a former military commander and public health official. \"He shouldn't be the only person in our organization who is ready to provide them.\"</p><p>At the south campus, where the church operates its Spanish-language ministry, four of the fastest EV chargers on the market are already installed under eight solar-paneled carports. McLarin, who drives an EV herself, expects this location to be their greatest revenue generator, as it's located closest to Highway 880, a major thoroughfare that runs from Oakland to San Jose. Currently, there are few charging options in this part of Hayward, a common issue in many <url normalizedValue=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4hj979ws\">lower-income and Black and brown neighborhoods</url>. These are the same neighborhoods where gig drivers, who often struggle with low wages, <url normalizedValue=\"https://forthmobility.org/storage/app/media/Reports/2024-Best-Practice-Papers/Best-Practices-For-Gig-Drivers-Transition-to-EVs.pdf\">tend to live</url>. Access to EVs and charging stations could help them save money in the long term and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the process.</p><p>According to Kinslow, Glad Tidings will reinvest 80 percent of its profits back into the church and the larger South Hayward community. \"We're actually building more solar than the demand of the buildings, so we make a profit from that [by selling the excess electricity they generate through the public EV charging stations], and then we use that profit for programming,\" Kinslow said.</p><p>For example, they may use the funding to provide free solar panels and batteries to income-qualifying households or help to finance electric vehicles for people in the neighborhood. \"We see this clean energy hub as the starting point to decarbonizing the rest of the community,\" he said. Kinslow's company is also creating a \"Neighborhood Decarbonization Index\" that utilizes survey data and machine learning to assess greenhouse gas emissions and evaluate neighborhood decarbonization progress over time.</p><p>Kinslow completed his Ph.D. at Stanford and spent most of his student years thinking about how to bring renewable energy to communities of color. Inspired by Al Gore's documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" in high school, he wanted to make a difference. He launched Gemini Energy Solutions while he was still in graduate school, with the goal of democratizing clean energy. In 2020, he met Bishop Macklin at an event organized by Carroll's nonprofit, Green the Church (GTC), and was later introduced to McLarin. A year later, they began crafting a plan to bring the community decarbonization hub to fruition.\u00a0</p><p>Gemini Energy Solutions handles project management and community engagement, while Green the Church\u00a0 rallies clergy and collaborates with their internal \"green team.\" Rev. Carroll founded GTC fifteen years ago and has built relationships with faith leaders across the country. The organization currently has contracts with more than 15 churches, representing various denominations, to develop Community Decarbonization Hubs. In addition to Glad Tidings, GTC and Gemini are working to build these hubs at three other Bay Area churches: Twenty-Third Avenue Church in Oakland, The Way Christian Center in Berkeley and University AME Zion in Palo Alto. Glad Tidings is the furthest along, and the lessons learned there are shaping the work Kinslow and Carroll are doing at the other churches.</p><p>According to Kinslow, <url normalizedValue=\"https://richmondside.org/2025/03/21/pge-blamed-for-solar-delays-richmond-nonprofit/\">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company's (PG&amp;E) delays</url> in connecting the solar panels, battery, master meter and EV chargers to the power grid set the project back by about six months. Now, their construction partner, Imperial Electric Service in Fresno, has a designated interconnection representative at PG&amp;E to accelerate future projects.</p><p>Gemini's project team also realized they needed a contractor to explain the impacts of construction, like loss of parking, \"which is a big thing for churches,\" Kinslow said.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest challenge was the two years it took to find financing.</p><p>\"We started this project based on faith,\" said Carroll, noting this was before the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested billions in clean energy. But banks struggled to grasp the concept of a Black community generating income rather than an outside company profiting from it, Carroll said. Eventually, he and Kinslow formed a joint entity, Green the Church Renewable Energy Development (GTC R.E.D.), which secured a $3 million revolving loan from the Kresge Foundation to bring clean energy to churches across the country.</p><p>More support came from Green Power Ventures, a Black-led investment management firm focused on climate resilience in low- to moderate-income areas, and Freedmen Green Bank &amp; Trust, a Black-led nonprofit and charitable trust devoted to climate resilience and clean energy. And while the churches aren't putting money into the community decarbonization hubs, Kinslow said, they are investing a lot of \"sweat equity.\"</p><p>The Bay Area's Black churches have long been a force for social change. In East Palo Alto, congregants organized community watch programs during times of racial unrest. St. Augustine's Episcopal Church in Oakland is the birthplace of the Black Panthers' first free breakfast program, which served undernourished children before school. At the 107-year-old <url normalizedValue=\"https://uamez.com/\">University AME Zion</url> (UAMEZ) church in Palo Alto, they see their forthcoming community decarbonization hub as a continuation of this legacy-and their own commitment to justice.\u00a0</p><p>\"When we started talking [about the hub] as a community, it wasn't like, 'Why should we do this?'\" said UAMEZ Pastor Kaloma Smith. \"It was like, 'This makes sense for the betterment of our world.'\"\u00a0</p><p>Born in Jamaica and raised in New York, Smith arrived at UAMEZ in 2013 to find common challenges facing Black churches, including declining membership. That drop-off is partly from residents leaving Palo Alto-and the state of California-due to rising costs of living, Smith said. The community decarbonization hub is part of his long-term effort to \"revitalize\" the church and \"be more effective, particularly for Gen Z and young families,\" for whom he says environmental issues are a top concern.</p><p>Working with Kinslow on the hub marks a full-circle moment: he joined the UAMEZ congregation while still a student at Stanford, and approached Pastor Smith with a proposal to replace the sanctuary's fluorescent lights. \"We didn't really have the money at the time,\" said Smith. \"But we saw there was phenomenal intersectionality between creating a benefit for the church, the environment and the community.\"</p><p>Besides installing solar panels and making energy-efficient upgrades, UAMEZ will add 12 to 16 EV charging stations, including eight fast chargers, to its parking lot. Construction of the UAMEZ hub is expected to take only six months, including its connection to the power grid. In the event of an earthquake, Smith envisions UAMEZ as the go-to place for \"all the things\" residents of midtown Palo Alto might require.</p><p>\"Black churches have always been resilience hubs,\" said Carroll, who added that they have often provided tangible support during times of crisis. But they have the potential to do more, he said, by turning their parking lots into \"revenue-generating microgrids\" that meet their neighborhoods' rapidly changing energy and climate needs.</p><p>Back in the pulpit at Glad Tidings, pink and purple lights illuminate the stage, casting a glow on Pretlow, the guest preacher, and an attentive congregation. \"Prosperity is coming to your house,\" he proclaimed, as the bassist plucked his strings. \"Favor is getting ready to find your address!\" His words seemed fitting for the era Glad Tidings is entering-as if that blessing had already come to pass.</p><p>This story was supported by the Climate Equity Reporting Project at Berkeley Journalism.

The legislation updates Supervisor Mandelman's All-Electric New Construction Ordinance and continues his commitment to a safer, healthier, and more sustainable City by ensuring major renovation building projects go all-electric and reduce emissions. The measure will be heard tomorrow (7/29) as a Committee Report at the Board of Supervisors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We can't build the San Francisco of the future with fuel from the past,\" said Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman. \"This legislation picks up where we left off with the All-Electric New Construction ordinance and affords us the opportunity to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in our existing buildings, improve indoor and outdoor air quality, and make San Francisco a safer, healthier, and more resilient place to live and work. Choosing clean energy is how we build the clean, all-electric City of the future,\"</p><p>Building operations are responsible for nearly half of San Francisco's emissions. Most of these emissions stem from the combustion of methane, more commonly referred to as natural gas, in existing buildings. Natural gas is a fossil fuel just like oil. It is a super pollutant that is 83 times more effective at trapping heat in our atmosphere than C02. The combustion of this super pollutant for heating, cooling, and other building functionsposes significant threats to humans and the planet. In addition to impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health, natural gas-powered fixtures further exacerbate the climate crisis, increase the risk of fire during earthquakes, and take significantly longer to get back up and running after seismic events.</p><p>\"This ordinance protects the health and safety of San Franciscans by phasing out outdated gas systems in major renovations,\" said Tyrone Jue, Director of the San Francisco Environment Department. \"It reduces indoor air pollution, strengthens building safety, and ensures our infrastructure is ready for a cleaner, more resilient future. And as we make our homes safer, we're also cutting the pollution that fuels the climate crisis because in San Francisco protecting people and protecting the planet go hand in hand.\"</p><p>Mechanical systems in existing buildings are customarily upgraded or replaced for many reasons, including deterioration, building expansion, energy efficiency improvements, or building conversions. Replacing gas-powered mechanical systems with all-electric when those systems are outdated or failing, and as part of a major renovation, is the most efficient and inexpensive way to transition existing buildings to electric. By requiring buildings undergoing major renovations, a very high bar in the building code, to be rebuilt all-electric, the new ordinance helps San Francisco electrify in the most cost-effective way.</p><p>\"This ordinance makes good on the city's commitment to the climate and public health by tackling a major source of pollution and emissions,\" said Sam Fishman, SPUR's sustainability and resilience policy manager. \"The ordinance will ensure that buildings are electrified in a smart and planned fashion, and is a major step in increasing the pace of decarbonization in San Francisco in a cost-effective way.\"</p><p>San Francisco is already going all-electric. The City's successful Climate Equity Hub has completed 26 projects/installs and has 45 in progress , targeting lower-income families with cost-free electric appliance installations. Affordable housing projects like Casa Adelante, Maceo May, 400 China Basin, and Transbay 2 West senior housing have been built all-electric, providing community with healthier, safer, all-electric buildings. And the renovation of a small residential project in the Mission District by the Mission Economic Development Association (MEDA) has replaced gas appliances with all-electric ones in both the existing building and in the new additions. In fact, throughout the State, the vast majority of new construction projects are all-electric.</p><p>\"The Sierra Club supports Board President Mandelman's All-Electric Major Renovations Ordinance. Nearly half of the City's greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings and so this ordinance contains a significant opportunity to address a major source of emissions in San Francisco, said Charles Whitfield, Chair of the San Francisco Group, San Francisco Bay Chapter of the Sierra Club. \"Building electrification can help solve some of the nation's top challengeslowering air pollution, improving resilience during extreme weather and earthquakes and dramatically reducing greenhouse gas pollution. We urge the passage of this important ordinance for both for the health of San Francisco residents and for the sake of the climate.\"</p><p>The ordinance is the result of over two years of planning and outreach. Engaged stakeholders include the Building Operations Task Force, developers, nonprofits, tenants' right organizations, contractors, unions, and professional/housing associations.

This contrast has helped shape Sims's curiosity about the environment around him. His background in environmental geosciences has allowed him to explore a range of fieldsfrom soil testing to corporate sustainabilitybefore finding his calling. Now, after working as a sustainability analyst at the NYC Mayor's Office and enrolling as a graduate student at Columbia Climate School, Sims is honing his skills to tackle one of the greatest challenges of our time: ensuring an equitable energy transition through data-informed climate policy. \"I've always loved taking things apart to understand how they work,\" Sims says. \"Policy is like thatit's not about dismantling systems, but making small tweaks that ripple out and create widespread impact.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We spoke with Sims about his path into climate work, his experience in the M.A. in Climate and Society program at the Columbia Climate School and his vision for the future. Learn more about Sims's journey in the QandA below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tell us how you found your way into the climate space.</p><p>I have always been drawn to science, particularly ecology and environmental systems. During my time in undergrad, I explored many different subjects to try and find a major that was a fit for me. I tried accounting at one point, and psychology at another, before landing in a senior capstone course on climate mitigation with Elizabeth Thomas. It was the first time the University at Buffalo offered a course on climate change, specifically climate change mitigation. We partnered with the Western New York Sustainable Business Roundtablea coalition of companies who are interested in taking on sustainability initiatives. Students met with staff and operations people and developed plans for these companies to reduce emissions in ways that made sense for them. This was my first exposure to mitigation and crafting a policy-type framework to reduce corporate emissions and save operational costs as well.</p><p>After graduating, I bounced between rolesdoing soil testing in a lab, remediation work and environmental consultingbefore landing at the NYC Mayor's Office of Management and Budget. I joined just as they were launching the Environmental Sustainability and Resiliency Task Force, where I analyzed greenhouse gas emissions across New York City policies. That role solidified my passion for climate policy and made me realize I wanted to focus on systemic change.</p><p>I'm really interested in problem-solving, especially when it comes to tackling challenges in cities. I like analyzing existing systems to identify changes that can move us toward more sustainable and healthier communities. For example, transitioning from diesel buses to electric ones could help reduce asthma hospitalizations in a neighborhood. Small changes like that can have a real impact on people's lives.</p><p>Why did you decide to apply to the Climate and Society program?</p><p>I always knew I wanted to come back to school for my master's degree, but I wasn't sure what field to pursue. As I explored different programs, what stood out about this onetrue to its namewas its focus on both climate and society. It really emphasizes the human aspect, with courses centered on climate justice and how to evaluate and implement policies that genuinely improve people's lives. That was a major draw for me to apply to the Climate School.</p><p>Another factor was the importance of the cohort, which someone mentioned to me while I was researching schools. My cohort includes people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, which has been eye-opening in terms of understanding the many different ways climate issues intersect with various fields. This program has also been marketed as intensive and interdisciplinary, and so far, it has lived up to that. I wanted an intensive experience that would allow me to cross-register for courses and explore different aspects of climate policy. The one-year timeline also made sense for me.</p><p>Which classes have been the most memorable and why?</p><p>There are two classes that impacted me the most during my first semester at the Climate School. The first is the Energy Regulation course I attended at the Law School with Michael Gerrard. I had never taken a law class before. Understanding the legal landscape is crucialwhether it's climate litigation, environmental justice laws or the regulatory hurdles that shape policy. This class gave me the tools to analyze what's feasible, what barriers exist and how legal frameworks can drive change.</p><p>Climate Justice Theory and Policy with Sheila Foster was another impactful course last semester. At the NYC Mayor's Office, I worked on the city's climate budget, and a major question was how to operationalize environmental justice. This course provided a framework for understanding the intersection of policy, justice and climate. How do we ensure that the energy transition doesn't worsen inequalities? How do we make sure policies don't leave communities behind? This class, alongside the law perspective, gave me new perspectives to think about these challenges and what should be considered when drafting policy or evaluating it.</p><p>This spring semester, I am looking forward to taking Regional Climate Science and Forecasting for Climate Services. This is a course on risk analysis and using climate data to look at regional and local climate variations. The climate resiliency aspect of this course is something I find very interesting. It is a best practice, and necessary, to have climate-informed policies with high-level data analysis.</p><p>What do you envision as your future role in solving the climate crisis?</p><p>I see myself in a research analyst role, focusing on the energy transition. We've gone through the industrial revolutions beforeand many other societal transitionsbut how do we transition this time without repeating the mistakes of the past? How do we ensure that low-income communities aren't left behind again as we shift to renewables? How do we decarbonize the grid without leaving communities worse off? This is definitely a hard topic, but these are the questions I hope to answer. Being in a space where I can craft policy and also do some research about how we can improve people's quality of lives with an equity lens is ideal for me.</p><p>At first, I planned to go straight back into the workforce, but this program has fueled more questions than answers. Now, I'm considering a predoctoral program or a Ph.D. to dive deeper into these issues. My goal is to conduct research that isn't just theoreticalit needs to be actionable, informing policy and directly benefiting communities. I don't want my work to sit on a shelf; I want it to lead to tangible, measurable change. I'm particularly interested in urban energy systems and the impact of electrification in highly dense cities like New York. I find myself asking questions like: If we switch entirely to electric, how does that affect low-income families? What are the unintended consequences?</p><p>Is there anything else you'd like to add?</p><p>At the end of the day, I'm just a data nerd who wants to apply my skills to climate justice. I love taking things apartwhether it's a social system, an energy grid or a policy frameworkand figuring out how to make them better. Life is a big puzzle, and I want to help solve it.</p>", "publisher": "States News Service", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 29, "title": "River center director dismissed", "published": "2025-06-16", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEQUIM \u2014 Frank Lowenstein is no longer the executive director of the Dungeness River Nature Center, its board of directors announced.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Board President Annette Hanson said the agency does not disclose personnel matters and that they want to respect Lowenstein's privacy.</p><p>She said it is not a legal matter.</p><p>\"We cannot share specific details,\" Hanson said.</p><p>\"We're focusing on a smooth transition and moving ahead with our mission.

As the largest customers on the grid, tell utilities you need an affordable and reliable decarbonized grid that benefits all customers.</p><p>Power-hungry data centers used for artificial intelligence and cloud computing are rapidly increasing the projected demand for electricity throughout the country. In response, electric utilities are doubling down on dirty fuels, delaying retirements of coal plants and rushing to build new gas plants to meet the anticipated demand.</p><p>The Sierra Club released its Demanding Better framework in September 2024, detailing how tech companies and other electric sector stakeholders can decarbonize the grid while powering data centers. In the interim six months, the pace of data center proposals has increased dramatically.</p><p>Organizations signing the letter include Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen, and the Sierra Club.</p><p>Statement from Jeremy Fisher, Principal Advisor on Climate and Energy for the Sierra Club and Demanding Better co-author:</p><p>\"Tech companies shortchanging their climate commitments for the sake of data center market dominance is a betrayal of the ingenuity and vision that's driven American innovation. We need bold, clear-throated leadership from these influential tech CEOs who know that our economy and wellbeing are inextricably linked to a livable climate. All tech companies must be held accountable for where their data centers go, and those data centers must be powered by local, new clean energy.\"</p><p>Statement from Eliza Pan, spokesperson for Amazon Employees for Climate Justice:</p><p>\"We've heard from so many Amazon tech workers that they're tired and fed up with their leadership lying to them and to the public. To simultaneously have new fracked gas plants built to power their AI data centers while claiming they're a corporate leader in renewable energy-the hypocrisy is astounding. Amazon's been using creative accounting to mislead the public about its emissions for years, and now, with how much leadership is pouring into developing AI and building out AI data centers, the problem is only going to get much worse.\"</p><p>Statement from Lashelle Johnson, LCV's Senior Director, State Climate &amp; Equity Policy:</p><p>\"Everyday people are going to pay for Big Tech's unchecked expansion - both on higher utility bills and more pollution. If these tech CEOs don't keep their commitments, step up, and lead on climate like they said they would, they risk responsibility for irreparable harm to people and the planet. Wind, solar, and batteries are the cleanest, cheapest and fastest sources of power and our grids need more, not less, to keep prices and pollution down.\"</p><p>Statement from Tyson Slocum, Energy Program Director for Public Citizen:</p><p>\"Big Tech and data center developers are among the most profitable corporations in the world, with the largest seven tech companies holding about $13 trillion in market capitalization.

Results show a moderate correlation with reference data ( r = 0.86) but an average overestimation of 3.77 \u00b0C, indicating PA sensors are better suited for identifying temperature trends but not for precise applications like extreme heat events. We also developed and compared eight calibration methods to create a replicable model using readily available crowdsourced data. The best-performing model reduced RMSE and MAE by 51% and 47%, respectively, and achieved an R <sup>2</sup> of 0.89 compared to the uncalibrated scenario.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Finally, the practical application of PA temperature data for identifying heat wave events was investigated, including an assessment of associated uncertainties. In sum, this work provides a crucial evaluation of PA's temperature monitoring capabilities, offering a pathway for improved heat mapping, multi-hazard vulnerability assessments, and public health interventions in the development of climate-resilient cities.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Evaluating PurpleAir Sensors: Do They Accurately Reflect Ambient Air Temperature?.

Citing concerns about conflicts of interest and lack of oversight, EPA terminated the grants in March 2025. The grantees sued, and the district court entered a preliminary injunction ordering EPA and Citibank to continue funding the grants.We conclude the district court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction. The grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractual, and therefore jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. And while the district court had jurisdiction over the grantees \u2019 constitutional claim, that claim is meritless. Moreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which on behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and management of this multi-billion-dollar fund. Accordingly, we vacate the injunction. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 3 of 924I.This case involves EPA grants awarded under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, for which Congress appropriated $27 billion. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-169, \u00a7 60103, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065 \u2013 67 (formerly codified at 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 (2024)). In August 2024, EPA awarded $20 billion to eight nonprofits pursuant to two of the grant programs it created: the National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. Five of those grantees are plaintiffs in this case: Climate United Fund ($6.97 billion), Coalition for Green Capital ($5 billion), Power Forward Communities, Inc. ($2 billion), Inclusiv, Inc. ($1.87 billion), and Justice Climate Fund, Inc. ($940 million).Each grant was memorialized in an agreement between the nonprofit and EPA. The grant agreements have an unusual structure. Typically, grant funds are held by the U.S Treasury and disbursed incrementally as grantees use the funds for program purposes. EPA structured these grants with a middleman that would hold the funds as a \u201cfinancial agent\u201d of the United States. According to EPA, this was the first time the federal government used a financial agent, as opposed to Treasury, to carry out this kind of grant program. Treasury entered a Financial Agency Agreement (\u201cFAA\u201d) with Citibank. As set forth in the grant agreements, the funds were to be transferred from Treasury to Citibank in a \u201ctwo-step transaction\u201d involving a \u201cdrawdown\u201d by the grantee and a subsequent \u201cdisbursement\u201d to the appropriate Citibank account. J.A 566. The disbursement by the grantee is deemed \u201can allowable cost\u201d under \u201cthe EPA award. \u201d Id.Although the funds are held at Citibank, the grantees \u2019 use of the funds remains highly restricted. The money may be used only \u201cfor the purposes and under the conditions of the [grant USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 4 of 925agreement],\u201d and \u201cmust be maintained\u201d at Citibank until the end of the grant \u2019 s period of performance. J.A 568. The grantees \u2019 use of the funds is further restricted by Account Control Agreements (\u201cACAs\u201d) between EPA, Citibank, and each of the grantees. The ACAs give the government a \u201cright to exclusive control\u201d over the Citibank accounts. J.A 72. If the government exercises that right, Citibank must follow the government \u2019 s transfer instructions \u201cwithout further consent by the [grantee]. \u201d Id. The ACAs expressly acknowledge that Citibank \u201cact[s] as a financial agent of the United States pursuant to the authority of the U.S Department of the Treasury. \u201d J.A 71.The sheer scale of the grant program and the method of allocating billions of dollars drew public attention and criticism. The record includes a widely publicized video in which an EPA employee was recorded describing how \u201cuntil recently\u201d his role was to make sure proper \u201cprocesses are in place to \u2026 prevent fraud and to prevent abuse,\u201d but after the election of President Donald Trump, EPA was \u201cjust trying to get the money out as fast as possible before they come in and \u2026 stop it all. \u201d J.A 705 n.1 The employee compared the situation to \u201cthrowing gold bars off the Titanic. \u201dThe month before President Trump \u2019 s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements\u2014with no apparent consideration from the grantees\u2014to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.1 The week before the1 In December 2024, the government unilaterally modified the grant agreements, including by (1) eliminating any reference to termination for agency priorities; (2) requiring \u201ccredible evidence \u2026 of a violation of Federal criminal law\u201d before the government could exercise its contractual right to terminate for waste, fraud, or abuse; and (3) giving the grantees an expanded right USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 5 of 926inauguration, EPA amended the ACAs to require Citibank to \u201ccontinue to disburse funds\u201d to the grantees, even if the government exercised its right of exclusive control, if the funds are \u201cassociated with financial obligations \u2018properly incurred \u2019 \u201d before the government exercised its right. J.A 658.After the change in administration, EPA reviewed the grants and raised concerns about conflicts of interest during the award process, the political connections of the chosen grantees, lack of government oversight and control over tens of billions of dollars, and last-minute amendments to the grant agreements and ACAs.2 In February 2025, the FBI recommended to Citibank that it \u201cplace an administrative freeze on the account(s) associated with\u201d the grantees \u2019 ACAs. As the government \u2019 s financial agent, Citibank complied and stopped disbursing funds to the grantees. EPA also referred the matter to the Office of Inspector General for investigation. Shortly thereafter, EPA terminated the grant agreements.The grantees sued, seeking to enjoin the terminations as unconstitutional, unlawful, and arbitrary and capricious. They sought a preliminary injunction barring EPA from terminating the grants \u201cexcept as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant award, and applicable law,\u201d and ordering Citibank toto cure any nonperformance. There is no serious dispute that these modifications increased the likelihood that a termination by the incoming administration would constitute a breach of contract.2 For example, the Acting Deputy Administrator averred in a letter to the EPA Inspector General that \u201cthe former director of the [Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund], personally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital \u2013 without recusing himself. \u201d J.A 670. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 6 of 927resume disbursements \u201cin accordance with the ACA. \u201d J.A 171 \u2013 72.The district court entered the injunction. It first held that it had jurisdiction because the grantees \u2019 claims were not essentially contractual and therefore did not need to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A , 778 F. Supp. 3d 90, 107 \u2013 11 (D.D.C 2025). On the merits, the court concluded the grantees were likely to succeed on their constitutional, regulatory, and arbitrary and capricious claims. The district court found the balance of harms supported an injunction because the nonprofits exist \u201cto fulfill the objectives of a grant\u201d and \u201csufficient protections [are] in place\u201d to prevent \u201creckless spending. \u201d Id. at 117, 120. The district court further concluded that an injunction \u201chalt[ing] any unlawful action\u201d serves the public interest. Id. at 121. The court enjoined Citibank as well, requiring it to disburse funds according to the relevant agreements.We administratively stayed the injunction and ordered the parties to take no action \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d with respect to the disputed funds, thereby prohibiting the grantees from making further commitments in reliance on the disputed funds. We then accelerated consideration of the merits of the appeal.II.While this litigation was pending, Congress enacted legislation repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. See Pub. L. No. 119-21, \u00a7 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 154 (2025) (repealing 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 and rescinding \u201cunobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section\u201d). Our partial administrative stay did not lift the portion of the district court \u2019 s order enjoining the grant terminations, so the funds at issue in this case remain at Citibank and remainUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 7 of 928obligated. Congress \u2019 s repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund therefore did not render this appeal moot.We review the district court \u2019 s preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, its underlying legal conclusions de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 726 (D.C Cir. 2022). We consider the same Winter factors the district court applied, which require a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction to establish that it \u201cis likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. \u201d Id. at 727 (quoting Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S 7, 20 (2008)).III.The district court erred in concluding the grantees are likely to succeed on their regulatory, arbitrary and capricious, and constitutional claims. See Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C Cir. 2014) (describing likelihood of success on the merits as the \u201cmost important factor\u201d when considering a preliminary injunction). The grantees \u2019 regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims can be heard only in the Court of Federal Claims, and their constitutional claim is meritless.A.The grantees first allege the termination of their grants violated Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) regulations and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). As a remedy, they sought and received an injunction barring the termination of their grants and restoring access to the funds held by Citibank. We conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction over these USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 8 of 929claims, which are essentially contractual and therefore must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.31.The federal government enjoys sovereign immunity and may be subject to suit only when it has explicitly waived that immunity. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S 392, 399 (1976). Waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed to protect the prerogatives of the government and to ensure the courts stay within the jurisdiction provided by Congress. See Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S 187, 192 (1996); Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S 682, 703 \u2013 05 (1949). The grantees brought their claims in district court, invoking the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity, which applies to claims \u201cseeking relief other than money damages. \u201d 5 U.S.C \u00a7 702. But this waiver applies only if no \u201cother statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought. \u201d Id. For contract claims against the government, the Tucker Act establishes review in the Court of Federal Claims, which may award only damages and cannot provide3 Although the dissent considers this threshold jurisdictional question a \u201cdiver[sion],\u201d Dissenting Op. 47, our authority to assess the lawfulness of EPA \u2019 s actions of course depends on having jurisdiction. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env \u2019 t, 523 U.S 83, 94 (1998). Concluding that jurisdiction over most of these claims lies with the Court of Federal Claims, we do not reach their merits. The dissent inverts this fundamental limitation on Article III courts by recounting at great length the integrity and virtue of the previous administration \u2019 s efforts to implement the Inflation Reduction Act and the alleged misdeeds of the current administration in terminating the grants. Our jurisdiction, however, rests on law, not on the severity of the alleged wrongdoing claimed by the grantees and reported by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Politico. See Dissenting Op. 11, 12, 14, 36. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 9 of 9210declaratory or injunctive relief except in narrow circumstances. See 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1491; Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 963 n.13 (D.C Cir. 1982); Walters v. Sec \u2019 y of Defense, 725 F.2d 107, 112 n.10 (D.C Cir. 1983).When it applies, Tucker Act jurisdiction is exclusive and precludes jurisdiction in district court under the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity.4 See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C Cir. 1992). The Court of Federal Claims is the \u201csingle, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C Cir. 1985). Because Congress has limited the forum and the remedies for contract claims against the government, a litigant whose claim is essentially contractual cannot \u201cavoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of the Tucker Act\u201d by simply asking for injunctive relief in district court. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967; Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613 (\u201c[T]he APA does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief. \u201d).This jurisdictional inquiry cannot turn on a plaintiff \u2019 s preferred characterization of its claim, lest we \u201cupset the carefully modulated waiver of sovereign immunity and grant of remedies for breach of contract embodied in the Tucker Act. \u201d Int \u2019 l Eng \u2019 g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 573, 580 (D.C Cir. 1975); see also McKay v. United States,4 The Tucker Act contains one exception to this rule, not relevant in this suit involving billions of dollars. Damages claims not exceeding $10,000 may be brought in district court, although the Tucker Act \u2019 s remedial restrictions still apply. See 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1346(a)(2); Int \u2019 l Eng \u2019 g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 573, 577 n.4 (D.C Cir. 1975); see also Contract Disputes Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-563, \u00a7\u00a7 3(a), 10(a), 14(a), 92 Stat. 2383, 2383 \u2013 84, 2388 \u2013 89 (limiting exception to non-procurement claims). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 10 of 9211516 F.3d 848, 851 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[I]n the contract context, a distinct line of authority preserves the sovereign \u2019 s immunity from being compelled to perform obligations it prefers to breach and compensate financially, holding that what are \u2018in essence \u2019 claims for breach of contract cannot circumvent the Tucker Act and its prohibition on equitable relief by being artfully pled as something else. \u201d).To determine whether jurisdiction was proper in the district court, we must therefore assess whether the grantees \u2019 claims are essentially contractual. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 \u2013 68. The fact that the grantees \u2019 \u201ccomplaint nowhere mentions breach of contract \u2026 cannot alone suffice to establish jurisdiction in the District Court. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77. Instead, for each claim we consider (1) whether \u201cthe source of the rights\u201d asserted is contractual or is \u201cbased on truly independent legal grounds\u201d and (2) whether \u201cthe type of relief sought\u201d is a typical contract remedy. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968 \u2013 71; see Transohio, 967 F.2d at 609.2.The grantees first allege EPA \u2019 s termination of their agreements violated OMB regulations. By terminating for \u201cagency priorities,\u201d EPA allegedly relied on a basis for termination not set forth in the grant agreements, in violation of 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4). Furthermore, EPA allegedly failed to provide written notice of termination as required by 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.341(a). Despite the grantees \u2019 characterization, their claims are essentially contractual and therefore the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear them.First, the source of the grantees \u2019 right to the relief they seek is their agreements, which are contracts for Tucker Act purposes. See Dep \u2019 t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025) (per curiam); Columbus Reg \u2019 l Hosp. v. United States,USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 11 of 9212990 F.3d 1330, 1338 \u2013 41 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 145 S. Ct. 2219, 2231 (2025) (explaining that courts have historically described federal grants as contracts). Each grantee \u2019 s right to the funds arises \u201conly upon creation and satisfaction of its contract with the government; in no sense d[oes] it exist independently of that contract. \u201d Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C Cir. 1985). While the grantees attempt to ground their claims in OMB guidance, the substance of these claims may be understood \u201cas entirely contained within the terms of the contract\u201d or in principles of contract law. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78.The claim that EPA violated 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4) expressly refers to and incorporates the grant agreements. The grantees interpret this OMB guidance as prohibiting the government from terminating based on agency priorities unless the grant agreements reserve the right to terminate on those grounds. Even assuming this is what the guidance requires, the grantees \u2019 claim turns on the government \u2019 s rights under the agreements\u2014a question of contract interpretation that the parties fiercely dispute. Because this claim perforce incorporates the grant agreements, it is not based \u201csolely\u201d on the regulation or on \u201ctruly independent legal grounds. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78; Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969 \u2013 70.The claim that EPA failed to give proper notice of termination in violation of 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.341(a) is not an independent legal ground for a slightly different reason. This allegation \u201ccould be phrased\u201d as a claim that the government stopped performing on the contract without sufficient warning. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. Federal contract law addresses USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 12 of 9213when defective notice by the government is actionable,5 and therefore the substance of the grantees \u2019 claim can be analyzed \u201csolely on contract principles. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. As we have explained, the fact that the government \u2019 s termination of a contract \u201calso arguably violates certain other regulations does not transform the action into one based solely on those regulations. \u201d Id. Indeed, \u201c[i]f the mere allegation\u201d of violations of the regulations governing federal contracting and grantmaking \u201cwere to bring claims of this type within the jurisdiction of the district court, Congress \u2019 intent to limit contract remedies against the government to damages in the [Court of Federal Claims] would be effectively circumvented. \u201d Id. (cleaned up). Because the substance of the grantees \u2019 notice claim sounds in federal contract law, the claim is essentially contractual and can be heard only in the Court of Federal Claims. The grantees cannot avoid the Tucker Act \u2019 s jurisdictional channeling by disguising a breach of contract claim as a claim that the government violated the regulations governing grantmaking.Furthermore, the guidance documents on which the grantees rely likely do not create enforceable private rights because they merely set out principles for agencies to follow when making grants. See Guidance for Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089 \u2013 90 (Apr. 22, 2024). These guidance provisions fall within subtitle A of Title 2, which sets forth OMB \u2019 s \u201cguidance to Federal agencies on5 See, e.g , Decker &amp; Co. v. West, 76 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201c[H]arm should accompany a defect in an otherwise proper termination notice in order for the contractor to seek relief based on that defect. \u201d); Philadelphia Regent Builders v. United States, 634 F.2d 569, 572 \u2013 73 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (declining to treat government \u2019 s termination as defective because government \u2019 s regulatory violations were \u201charmless technical defects\u201d).

But in any event, as the dissent concedes, Dissenting Op. 58, these regulatory claims are essentially contractual, and we have no jurisdiction to consider them.Second, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction because the remedy the grantees seek is contractual in nature. The grantees requested an injunction barring EPA from terminating the grants, \u201cexcept as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant award, and applicable law,\u201d and ordering Citibank to resume disbursements \u201cin accordance with the ACA. \u201d The grantees maintain they own the funds and seek an injunction barring unlawful interference, rather than an order for specific performance. But the grantees \u2019 \u201cownership\u201d of the funds goes only as far as the grant agreements and the ACAs permit. And the funds are held by Citibank, which acts as a fiduciary of the government. Despite their characterization, in substance, the grantees are seeking specific performance of their agreements with the government.6 As then-Judge Scalia6 The dissent \u2019 s only legal argument that we have jurisdiction turns on the claim that the grantees have \u201ctitle\u201d to the billions of dollars in government funding. To demonstrate the grantees \u2019 ownership, however, the dissent relies on the grant agreements and the ACAs\u2014that is, on the disputed and ongoing contracts that govern the parties \u2019 relationship. Dissenting Op. 48. The dissent \u2019 s argument merely reinforces that this dispute is contractual and belongs in the Court of Federal Claims. And even assuming the grantees had somehow secured title, that would simply mean the grantees might have a Takings Clause claim for damages, a claim they have not made and which in any event would also have to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. See Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 14 of 9215explained, \u201c[t]he waiver of sovereign immunity in the [APA] does not run to actions seeking declaratory relief or specific performance in contract cases. \u201d7 Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1523 (D.C Cir. 1986). \u201c[A] complaint involving a request for specific performance must be resolved by the [Court of Federal] Claims. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 80.In sum, the grantees cannot manufacture district court jurisdiction through artful pleading. Because the grantees \u2019 regulatory claims are essentially contractual, they must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.3.Nor can the grantees repackage their contract claims by invoking the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. The grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claims are also essentially2170, 2173 (2019) (explaining the Tucker Act \u201cprovides the standard procedure for bringing [takings] claims\u201d against the federal government and that \u201c[e]quitable relief [is] not available\u201d if \u201cmonetary relief \u2026 under the Tucker Act\u201d is).7 The dissent \u2019 s reliance on Sharp is entirely misplaced. In Sharp, there was no dispute that the plaintiff was a military officer, that he had an interest in his employment, and that the deprivation of that interest without due process could be litigated in district court under Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S 61, 71 (1974). See Sharp, 798 F.2d at 1523. Here, by contrast, the rights and interests of the grantees are disputed. The grantees assert they \u201cperformed\u201d on their contracts when Treasury deposited federal funds at Citibank, the government \u2019 s financial agent. Even overlooking the oddity of this argument, whether the grantees have performed depends entirely on the terms of the disputed contracts\u2014a question that must be adjudicated in the Court of Federal Claims. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 15 of 9216contractual, considering both the source of the legal right asserted and the remedy sought.The grantees assert the government acted arbitrarily because it \u201coffered no facts or individualized reasoning to justify\u201d the grant terminations. And the grantees insist they can challenge the sufficiency of the government \u2019 s reasons for terminating the grants separately from the issue of whether the terminations were allowed under the agreements. But this court has expressly and repeatedly rejected attempts to manufacture district court jurisdiction by framing contract claims as violations of the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. See Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77 \u2013 78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580. Despite the grantees \u2019 characterizations, the remedy they seek is specific performance of their contracts, and they have identified no right to that relief that is \u201ctruly independent\u201d of the grant agreements. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970.As already discussed in reference to the grantees \u2019 regulatory claims, the grantees seek to set aside their grant terminations, which means they seek specific performance. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 79 \u2013 80. This is a \u201ctypical contract remedy\u201d that indicates a claim is \u201cfounded upon a contract for purposes of the Tucker Act. \u201d Spectrum Leasing, 764 F.2d at 894 \u2013 95; see also Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613.The APA \u2019 s substantive bar on arbitrary and capricious action does not give the grantees an independent right to specific performance of their grant agreements. To the extent the grantees argue the government acted arbitrarily by failing to follow the terms of the grant agreements, that argument can be evaluated only by \u201creference to and incorporation of\u201d the agreements. Richardson, 512 F.2d at 578. The source of the right asserted is therefore not \u201ctruly independent\u201d of the contracts. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 16 of 9217To the extent the grantees argue the terminations were arbitrary regardless of whether they were permitted under the agreements, that challenge turns, in substance, on principles of federal contract law. That law prohibits the government from \u201cdishonor[ing], with impunity, its contractual obligations\u201d even when a contract allows the government to terminate for convenience. Maxima Corp. v. United States, 847 F.2d 1549, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (cleaned up). The grantees \u2019 argument that the termination was arbitrary and capricious is simply a claim that EPA breached the grant agreements by terminating with \u201cimpunity. \u201d That claim must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims.The grantees insist the APA gives them an independent right to be free of arbitrary agency action, including contract terminations. But we have long rejected the idea that the APA \u2019 s general bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract terminations to a parallel review scheme in district court.8 See Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77 \u2013 78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (\u201c[D]ecisions made by contracting officers pursuant to contract clauses fall outside the contemplation of the [APA]. \u201d). The APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action did not \u201cdestroy the Court of [Federal] Claims by implication. \u201d Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (cleaned up).8 The dissent \u2019 s analysis focuses on the grantees \u2019 \u201ctheory of relief\u201d and concludes that because the grantees have \u201clegitimate\u201d APA claims and request injunctive relief, the district court has jurisdiction. Dissenting Op. 56 \u2013 57. But Supreme Court and circuit precedent require that we look beyond plaintiffs \u2019 characterization of their claims and determine whether the claims are \u201cbased on truly independent legal grounds,\u201d not simply whether plaintiffs have made good faith legal arguments. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969 \u2013 70. On this central question, the dissent has nothing to offer. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 17 of 9218In sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims that the federal government terminated a grant agreement arbitrarily or with impunity. Claims of arbitrary grant termination are essentially contractual and fall outside the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity.This conclusion is reinforced by the Supreme Court \u2019 s recent decision in a stay posture that a very similar arbitrary and capricious challenge to federal grant terminations likely could not be brought in district court. See Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968. In that case, state plaintiffs sued in district court and claimed the Department of Education \u2019 s decision to terminate several grants was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The district court enjoined the terminations. The Court stayed the injunction on the ground that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction over the APA claims because \u201cthe Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on \u2018any express or implied contract with the United States. \u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1491(a)(1)). The Supreme Court has doubled down on this conclusion in another case staying an injunction against discretionary grant terminations: \u201cThe [APA] \u2019 s \u2018limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity \u2019 does not provide the District Court with jurisdiction to adjudicate claims \u2018based on \u2019 \u201d the plaintiffs \u2019 grants \u201cor to order relief designed to enforce any \u2018obligation to pay money \u2019 pursuant to those grants. \u201d Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health v. Am. Pub. Health Ass \u2019 n, No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Aug. 21, 2025) (quoting Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968).The Court \u2019 s reasoning requires respect and strongly supports our conclusion that the grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious challenge to the grant terminations is a disguised contract claim that cannot be heard in district court. See Trump v. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025) (\u201cAlthough our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 18 of 9219court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases. \u201d); Priests for Life v. HHS, 808 F.3d 1, 25 (D.C Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that Supreme Court stay orders are \u201cextremely strong signals\u201d); see generally Trevor N. McFadden &amp; Vetan Kapoor, The Precedential Effects of The Supreme Court \u2019 s Emergency Stays, 44 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol \u2019 y 827, 831 (2021) (arguing some emergency orders are \u201cauthoritative with respect to future cases considering the same legal questions\u201d).In the face of this overwhelming authority, the grantees nonetheless maintain that jurisdiction over their arbitrary and capricious claims is proper. But the two cases on which they rely cannot support that conclusion.The grantees point out that this court reviewed an agency \u2019 s grant termination under the APA \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious standard in Kansas City v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 923 F.2d 188, 193 (D.C Cir. 1991). But the court in that case made no mention of the Tucker Act, nor did it engage with our decisions in Richardson and Ingersoll-Rand. This drive-by jurisdictional holding does not bind us. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env \u2019 t, 523 U.S 83, 91 (1998). Just one year later, we extensively considered the jurisdictional framework and \u201cdecline[d] to overrule this Court \u2019 s very specific holdings that the APA does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief. \u201d Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613. As the Supreme Court \u2019 s stay order in Department of Education confirms, Kansas City is an outlier and does not support district court jurisdiction over the grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claims.Second, the grantees point to Maryland Department of Human Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services, which held that a state agency could maintain an USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 19 of 9220arbitrary and capricious claim in district court to challenge the federal government \u2019 s withholding of grant funds. 763 F.2d 1441, 1451, 1453 (D.C Cir. 1985). In that case, the federal government was required by law to pay block grant funds to Maryland according to a statutory formula. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1397a(a) \u2013 (b), 1397b(b) (1982). We explained that Maryland \u2019 s claim was not contractual for purposes of the Tucker Act because it \u201cturn[ed] on the interpretation of statutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement negotiated by the parties. \u201d Maryland, 763 F.2d at 1449. There was no \u201ccontract within the meaning of the Tucker Act\u201d\u2014only statutes and regulations that dictated how much Maryland was entitled to receive, how the funds could be spent, and under what circumstances the federal government could withhold payment. Id.By contrast, these grant agreements are \u201ccontracts\u201d within the meaning of the Tucker Act because they include the traditional contract elements of offer, acceptance, and consideration. See, e.g , Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968; Columbus Reg \u2019 l Hosp., 990 F.3d at 1338 \u2013 41. The grantees do not suggest that any of these elements is lacking. Moreover, the Inflation Reduction Act did not specify who was to receive money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund or in what amount. Those determinations were to be made \u201con a competitive basis\u201d at the discretion of the EPA Administrator. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (2024). The grantees obtained federal funds only because they were awarded discretionary EPA grants, the terms of which are governed by the grant agreements. See Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *4 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that Department of Education \u201ccontrols\u201d when a district court seeks to remedy \u201cthe government \u2019 s denial of previously awarded discretionary grants\u201d). The dispute over the termination of these agreements does not turn solely, or USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 20 of 9221really at all, on the statute, and the relief sought is continued performance of the agreements.In short, the grantees cannot circumvent the Court of Federal Claims by arguing that EPA \u2019 s termination of the grants was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.4.Finally, the grantees cannot bring their regulatory or arbitrary and capricious claims in district court by arguing that the EPA Administrator acted ultra vires. The grantees invoke the Larson-Dugan doctrine, which, like the Ex parte Young exception to state sovereign immunity, holds that sovereign immunity does not bar suits against federal officers whose \u201cpowers are limited by statute\u201d and whose actions go \u201cbeyond those limitations\u201d or are \u201cconstitutionally void. \u201d Larson, 337 U.S at 689, 701 \u2013 02; see also Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S 609, 621 \u2013 23 (1963). The grantees insist Administrator Zeldin exceeded his lawful authority by terminating the agreements in violation of the OMB guidance provisions and the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. We disagree.The Supreme Court in Larson recognized that the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity does not apply to contract claims: \u201cThe Government, as representative of the community as a whole, cannot be stopped in its tracks by any plaintiff who presents a disputed question of property or contract right. \u201d 337 U.S at 704. As already explained, the grantees \u2019 regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims essentially allege the government (1) violated the terms of the grant agreements and (2) acted with impunity. If proven, these claims establish breach of contract. They do not establish that the government (or any official) acted in excess of statutory limits or in contravention of the Constitution, as is required toUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 21 of 9222invoke the Larson-Dugan exception.9 See Larson, 337 U.S at 695 (squarely rejecting the contention that \u201can officer given the power to make decisions\u201d only has sovereign immunity when he \u201cmake[s] correct decisions\u201d).The grantees cannot bootstrap district court jurisdiction through the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity because their regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims are essentially contractual.B.The grantees also maintain that EPA violated the \u201cSeparation of Powers\u201d by not enforcing the Inflation Reduction Act, citing In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C Cir. 2013). The grantees contend that Congress directed how and when the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund appropriations were to be spent and that EPA violated those directives by canceling the grant agreements. Although the district court had jurisdiction over this claim, it is unlikely to succeed on the merits.As an initial matter, this is not a constitutional claim at all, but rather a claim that EPA violated the Inflation Reduction Act. Claims that agency officials acted in excess of their statutory authority do not ipso facto allege violations of the \u201cSeparation of Powers. \u201d See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S 462,9 This is consistent with the general principle that \u201c[i]t is not illegal for a party to breach a contract. \u201d United States v. Blankenship, 382 F.3d 1110, 1133 (11th Cir. 2004). \u201cThe duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it[]\u2014and nothing else. \u201d United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S 839, 919 \u2013 20 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting Holmes, The Path of the Law (1897), in 3 The Collected Works of Justice Holmes 391, 394 (S. Novick ed. 1995)). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 22 of 9223474 (1994) (distinguishing between \u201cclaims that an official exceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims that he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other\u201d); cf. 5 U.S.C \u00a7 706(2) (distinguishing judicial review of agency action \u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity\u201d and action \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations\u201d). As we recently explained, when a \u201csupposed separation-of-powers violation turns entirely on whether [executive] officials violated the governing statutes, \u2026 Dalton requires us to analyze the claim as an ultra vires one. \u201d Nat \u2019 l Treasury Emps. Union v. Vought, No. 25-5091, 2025 WL 2371608, at *19 \u2013 20 (D.C Cir. Aug. 15, 2025); see also Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097, 2025 WL 2326021, at *6 \u2013 9 (D.C Cir. Aug. 13, 2025). The grantees here allege violations of the statute, not the Constitution, and we decline to adopt a principle that would convert every statutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim.We conclude EPA did not violate the Inflation Reduction Act when it terminated these grants. The grantees have identified no statutory provision that barred the cancellation of the grants. In relevant part, the Inflation Reduction Act \u201cappropriated to the Administrator\u201d $20 billion \u201cto make grants[] on a competitive basis\u201d and provided that the funds are \u201cto remain available until September 30, 2024. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (2024). The grantees interpret these provisions as a mandate that EPA spend the full $20 billion, a mandate that EPA allegedly violated when it cancelled grants after the September 2024 appropriation deadline. But even assuming the statute required EPA to obligate all $20 billion by the appropriation deadline, EPA did so. EPA later cancelled the grants, but the Act does not limit the Administrator \u2019 s discretion to withhold or terminate grants. And EPA repeatedly represented that it planned to recommit the funds. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 23 of 9224The grantees and the dissent insist EPA \u2019 s promise to recommit the funds was hollow because the Inflation Reduction Act appropriation had lapsed by the time EPA terminated the grants, and therefore EPA had no ability to recommit the funds. But the grantees cite no authority for the proposition that when an agency cancels a grant after an appropriation has lapsed, any recommitment of those funds requires deobligation and a new appropriation by Congress. Indeed, such a categorical rule would be inconsistent with the longstanding position of the Government Accountability Office\u2014a legislative agency\u2014that the Executive Branch may issue replacement contracts even after an appropriation has lapsed. See Funding of Replacement Contracts, 68 Comp. Gen. 158, 158 (Dec. 19, 1988); see also 31 U.S.C \u00a7 1552(a) (providing that appropriation account does not close until five years after an appropriation expires).In fact, the Executive often issues replacement contracts after terminating for convenience, a practice the Comptroller General has approved for decades.10 See U.S General Accounting Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 3d ed., vol. 1, 5-28 \u2013 5-33 (Jan. 2004) (discussing history of replacement contracts and associated Comptroller General opinions). Moreover, the rule the grantees assert would be inconsistent with this court \u2019 s recognition that the government gets \u201ca second chance to obligate\u201d even after an appropriation has lapsed if a court sets aside the original, timely obligation. Population Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1071 (D.C Cir. 1986). Considering the longstanding practice of the political branches, as well as our precedent, we are not persuaded that10 The Comptroller General opinion the dissent cites is inapposite because it involves new obligations, not replacement grants. See Dissenting Op. 41. Replacement grants do not require a new obligation of funds. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 24 of 9225the government lacks authority to recommit the funds after termination.11The district court \u2019 s determination that the grantees were likely to succeed on their \u201cconstitutional\u201d Inflation Reduction Act claim rests on both factual and legal error. The court found that \u201cEPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115. This factual determination was not supported by any evidence in the record and rested only on the district court \u2019 s assertion that EPA \u201csuspended all eight grants. \u201d Id. at 116. But the suspension of the grants standing alone cannot demonstrate EPA was shutting down the statutory programs without congressional approval. Indeed, EPA repeatedly stated that it planned to recommit the grant money with greater oversight and accountability, contradicting the district court \u2019 s shutdown finding. Absent any clear evidence to the contrary, EPA \u2019 s representations were entitled to a presumption of regularity. See Am. Fed \u2019 n of Gov \u2019 t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Reagan, 870 F.2d 723, 727 (D.C Cir. 1989).Rather than credit EPA \u2019 s statements or explain why the presumption of regularity was overcome, the district court simply declared EPA was shutting down the programs. The court disregarded the government \u2019 s interest in prudent management of the grant programs and the government \u2019 s representations that it planned to properly supervise, rather11 We need not consider for purposes of this appeal whether the recent repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and the recission of \u201cunobligated balances,\u201d affects EPA \u2019 s ability to recommit the funds at issue here. If the repeal of the statute bars EPA from recommitting the funds, it stands to reason that the repeal also relieves EPA of any statutory obligation to do so. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 25 of 9226than abandon, the grantmaking process.12 The district court \u2019 s conclusory factual finding of program dismantlement was clearly erroneous. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 118 (D.C Cir. 2001) (explaining that even on clear error review the court is not required to \u201caccept findings that are utterly deficient\u201d).Because EPA issued the grants in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act, and there is no evidence the agency sought to dismantle the programs without congressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees \u2019 claims. In that case we issued a writ of mandamus because for years the Nuclear Regulatory Commission flagrantly disregarded statutory commands, failed to spend appropriated funds, and plainly stated it had no intention of complying with its statutory obligations. In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 257 \u2013 59. By contrast, EPA entered the grant agreements before the appropriation expired in September 2024, in compliance with any requirement in the Inflation Reduction Act to spend funds. EPA subsequently terminated the agreements because of its concerns about lack of oversight and potential conflicts of interest during the award process.EPA \u2019 s actions here are well within the Executive Branch \u2019 s authority and responsibility to manage the expenditure of funds and to ensure that money appropriated by Congress is properly spent for its intended purposes. The grant terminations may be12 The district court also ignored the government \u2019 s evidence of mismanagement of the grant funds, such as the damning \u201cgold bars\u201d video, which further supports EPA \u2019 s good faith in deciding to terminate the grants and recommit the funds with proper supervision and accountability. See J.A 107 n.1 Moreover, the dissent focuses primarily on EPA \u2019 s actions against these grantees, but the repeated recounting of these actions tells us little about whether EPA will recommit the funds through a more robust process. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 26 of 9227challenged on the merits as a breach of contract, but nothing in the Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care that the grant programs be faithfully executed.The grantees \u2019 false invocation of the separation of powers cannot justify this preliminary injunction, which bars EPA from carrying out basic executive functions to ensure the prudent and effective management of substantial public funds.13IV.The district court also abused its discretion in applying the remaining Winter factors: irreparable harm to the plaintiff, the balance of the equities, and the public interest. While some grantees may be forced to shutter their operations during the litigation, their harms do not outweigh the interests of the government and the public in the proper stewardship of billions of taxpayer dollars.A.The loss of grant funds during this litigation is not irreparable because the harm is compensable through money damages. The district court concluded the grantees would suffer irreparable harm because their \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cbusiness operations \u2026 depend[] on their grant money. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117. But it is well-established that \u201ceconomic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm. \u201d Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C Cir. 2015) (cleaned up). Pecuniary injuries can be13 The grantees also argue EPA will violate the Appropriations Clause if it reobligates the funds after terminating the grant agreements. The district court did not base its preliminary injunction on this argument, so we do not address it. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 27 of 9228redressed through money damages if a plaintiff proves its case. We have recognized only one exception, for pecuniary loss that \u201cthreatens the very existence of the movant \u2019 s business. \u201d Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C Cir. 1985). This exception generally applies when government action threatens the existence of an independent private entity. See, e.g , Alpine Sec. Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., 121 F.4th 1314, 1329 (D.C Cir. 2024) (finding irreparable harm when a financial services firm would be forced to shutter if regulatory action took effect during litigation).The grantees do not fall within this exception. The nonprofit entities that may need to suspend operations are entities that were created solely for the purpose of applying for and spending these federal grants. So while their \u201cexistence relies on grant money\u201d as the district court held, that is because these entities were established to benefit from government largesse. Creating such an entity cannot establish an irrevocable claim to government funds or an entitlement to injunctive relief preventing the Executive Branch from supervising and managing those funds. In short, the existential threat alleged by the grantees does not amount to irreparable harm.EPA terminated the grants because of concerns about the integrity of the grantmaking process. While litigation is pending, the grantees may have to scale down their operations or return to the operational status they had before they received federal funds. Although this causes some harm, the harm is readily compensable through damages and therefore is not irreparable.B.The balance of the equities and the public interest factors similarly favor the government. The injunction harms the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 28 of 9229government and the public interest by preventing the Executive Branch from properly and prudently managing billions of dollars in public funds. The grantees have an interest in continued access to government funding. But the government and the public have a stronger interest in protecting the public fisc and eliminating the appearance of impropriety around these grant programs.Moreover, if the grant terminations are later determined to be a breach of contract, the government may be required to pay damages to the grantees, which would substantially, if not entirely, redress the grantees \u2019 interim injuries. By contrast, if the government \u2019 s position is eventually vindicated, it will have no apparent means to recover funds spent down while the litigation has run its course. See Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Order) (recognizing irreparable harm to the government because the grant \u201cfunds cannot be recouped and are thus irrevocably expended\u201d) (cleaned up). The government \u2019 s (and the public \u2019 s) harm from an erroneous injunction is thus irreparable in a way that the grantees \u2019 harm from an erroneous contract termination is not.Finally, Congress has explicitly channeled breach of government contract claims to the Court of Federal Claims and limited remedies to damages. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 (\u201cThe Court of [Federal] Claims may neither grant declaratory nor injunctive relief. \u201d) (cleaned up). The district court has no jurisdiction over these claims, and even the Court of Federal Claims lacks authority to issue injunctive relief. The public interest favors limiting federal courts to the jurisdiction and remedies provided by Congress. See Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2562 (2025) (\u201cWhen a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too. \u201d). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 29 of 9230The same considerations support vacating the injunction as to Citibank. The district court did not find that the grantees were likely to succeed on any of their independent claims against Citibank, which involve breach of contract, conversion, and replevin. To the contrary, the court found that \u201cCitibank performed its obligations under the FAA in accordance with its responsibilities as a financial agent of the United States. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The injunction against Citibank merely serves to stop Citibank from following the government \u2019 s instructions, which the district court considered unlawful. Because we conclude the injunction against the government should be vacated, the derivative injunction against Citibank must be vacated as well.* * *For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court \u2019 s injunction and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.So ordered. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 30 of 92PILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting: On the majority \u2019 s telling, Plaintiffs bring garden-variety contract claims against EPA \u2019 s reasonable decisions to terminate their grant awards. That version of events fails to contend with the government \u2019 s actual behavior and misapprehends Plaintiffs \u2019 claims, leading the majority to the wrong conclusion at every step of its review of the district court \u2019 s preliminary injunction.Three years ago, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. One of the law \u2019 s signature provisions directs the Environmental Protection Agency to distribute $20 billion in grants for investment in projects to develop clean energy infrastructure and manufacturing capacity. Congress structured the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to provide jobs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, especially in low-income and underinvested communities. EPA distributed the grant money by the fall of 2024, as Congress required.After the change in administration, in response to President Trump \u2019 s directives to terminate the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d new leadership at EPA decided to take back the money already awarded to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were holding and spending the money exclusively as Congress intended. Yet EPA\u2014in conjunction with counterparts at the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the U.S Treasury\u2014opened spurious criminal and civil investigations into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and pressured Citibank into \u201cvoluntarily\u201d freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts even though the government lacked probable cause to impose such a freeze. EPA then attempted to take back Plaintiffs \u2019 money by \u201cterminating\u201d all eight grants, comprising the entire $20 billion congressionally mandated program, 24 hours before the government was due in district court for a hearing on Plaintiffs \u2019 application for a temporary restraining order. Those unprecedented and unfounded actions were part of EPA \u2019 s hunt for reasons to shut down the congressionally mandated program and claw back the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 31 of 922funding that had already been disbursed to Plaintiffs and committed to infrastructure projects. EPA \u2019 s termination letter claims the agency conducted a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d but fails to identify any contract breach or violation of law by Plaintiffs.So far, EPA has succeeded in depriving Plaintiffs of access to their funding for six months. The freeze has already caused Plaintiffs to default on promised loans and scuttled affordable housing and energy projects implementing Congress \u2019 s vision. EPA has done all that without presenting to any court any credible evidence or coherent reason that could justify its interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 money and its sabotage of Congress \u2019 s law.Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s action to gut the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as contrary to the Constitution \u2019 s separation of powers. Fundamental to our \u201cconstitutional system of separation of powers\u201d is the \u201csettled, bedrock principle[]\u201d that neither the President nor his \u201csubordinate executive agencies\u201d may \u201cdecline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. \u201d In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259, 267 (D.C Cir. 2013); U.S Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9, cl. 7; U.S Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. Yet that is just what EPA decided to do and has begun to effectuate here. The record strongly supports the district court \u2019 s determination that EPA has frozen and attempted to repossess billions of dollars \u2019 worth of lawfully spent money for no substantiated reason other than disagreements with Congress \u2019 s policy determination\u2014grounds that are entirely inapposite and inadequate, and that the government does not defend here. The agency has no lawful basis\u2014nor even a nonfrivolous assertion of any basis\u2014to interfere with funding that, pursuant to Congress \u2019 s instructions, already belongs to Plaintiffs, who in turn have committed it to energy infrastructure development USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 32 of 923and advanced manufacturing projects according to Congress \u2019 s plan.That constitutional violation alone justifies the district court \u2019 s injunction. The injunction is independently warranted by the arbitrary and capricious character of EPA \u2019 s actions. Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s taking of their funds under an irrational process with only pretextual justifications. That is a quintessential APA claim that belongs in the district court, and on which Plaintiffs are likely to succeed.Defendants insist that this is a government contract dispute that we must dismiss because, under the Tucker Act, only the Court of Federal Claims has authority to decide it. Our Tucker Act precedents do not support that contention. They direct us to analyze whether a claim is \u201cat its essence\u201d contractual and, if it is, to cede jurisdiction to the Court of Claims for its expert \u201cknowledge of the government contracting process. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 76, 78 (D.C Cir. 1985). That analysis, turning on the source of the right Plaintiffs assert and the nature of the relief they seek\u2014here, constitutional and statutory claims to retain already-disbursed funds to which they remain lawfully entitled\u2014confirms the jurisdiction of the district court. Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968-69 (D.C Cir. 1982). The majority acknowledges the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 constitutional claims. And nothing in the Tucker Act or binding precedent interpreting it supports the majority \u2019 s view that Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim is transformed into a contract claim and ousted from the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction merely because it seeks to prevent EPA \u2019 s capricious interference with funds that Plaintiffs obtained through and must spend consistently with a contract. Maj. Op. 16-18. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 33 of 924In characterizing this case as merely a contract dispute subject to the Tucker Act \u2019 s jurisdictional bar, the majority baselessly strips the district court of authority to decide these important claims. The majority holds that a plaintiff cannot bring an arbitrary and capricious challenge to any government action that affects something of value that was originally obtained by contract. Maj. Op. 16-18. Doing so undercuts the Constitution \u2019 s and the APA \u2019 s checks on the Executive \u2019 s illegitimate seizure of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds and subversion of Congress \u2019 s will. The government \u2019 s Tucker Act defense is especially pernicious here. Dismissal of this case presumably will enable the government to carry out its announced plan to immediately and irrevocably seize Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. At best, in the unlikely event the government refrains from immediately draining Plaintiffs \u2019 frozen accounts, the further delay involved in reinitiating litigation in the Court of Federal Claims will itself irreparably harm the infrastructure projects that cannot move forward and may fail without funding. In these circumstances, \u201c[i]t is no overstatement to say that our constitutional system of separation of powers w[ill] be significantly altered\u201d by \u201callow[ing] executive . . . agencies to disregard federal law in the manner asserted in this case. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 267.BACKGROUNDA. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction FundIn 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The Act establishes the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to distribute that money for investment in projects to deploy solar and electric energy technology throughout the country, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065-67 (2022) (codified USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 34 of 925at 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434). The program was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and \u201cimprove health outcomes, lower energy costs, and create high-quality jobs for Americans\u2014all while strengthening [the] country \u2019 s economic competitiveness and ensuring energy security. \u201d Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) 3 (J.A 1735).Achieving that vision would \u201crequire a tremendous amount of financing and private capital for greenhouse gas- and air pollution-reducing projects across the country. \u201d Id. Because the private sector has historically been hesitant to invest in clean energy projects, Congress designed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to finance clean energy projects \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A). Specifically, Congress directed EPA to spend $20 billion by September 2024 to fund nonprofit financial institutions, which in turn must use the funds either to recruit private investment for clean energy programs or to assist community projects to reduce air pollution. Id. \u00a7 7434(a)(2)-(3), (c)(3).Pursuant to Congress \u2019 s directive, in July 2023, EPA created two funding programs: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit lenders to use public seed money to attract private investment for tens of thousands of energy-efficient affordable housing, transportation, and electricity projects throughout the country; and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit organizations to use public seed money to enable community lenders to invest in clean energy projects in low-income and underinvested communities.EPA conducted a rigorous, competitive selection process, which included review of applicants \u2019 detailed program plans USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 35 of 926and budgets, organizational capacity, and experience managing third-party capital and financial risk. EPA selected eight nonprofits\u2014lenders and community organizations\u2014capable of carrying out those aims. The approved workplans and budgets of the applicants EPA selected describe how those organizations will use the federal funds they have since received to expand access to\u2014and recruit private investment for\u2014affordable construction and renovation of energy-efficient businesses, schools, municipal buildings, healthcare facilities, public housing, and transportation, particularly in rural, Tribal, and low-income areas.In compliance with the September 2024 deadline Congress imposed, EPA obligated the grant funds for both programs by the summer of 2024. To enable the grantees to recruit private investment\u2014as Congress required, 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A)\u2014EPA deposited the grant funds in accounts opened in the grantees \u2019 names at Citibank. Unlike EPA \u2019 s traditional disbursement system, that structure gave the grantees title to the full amount of the award funds up front, allowing those funds to serve as assets for the grantees to rely on to raise private capital by reducing financial risk for private investments. See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 7-14.The Plaintiff grantees \u2019 legal title to their award funds is spelled out in Account Control Agreements between EPA, Citibank, and each grantee. Those agreements specify that Citibank \u201cmaintains the Accounts for the [grantee]\u201d and state that the grantee is \u201cthe Bank \u2019 s customer with respect to the Accounts and [] the entitlement holder with respect to all financial assets credited . . . to the Accounts. \u201d Account Control Agreement \u00a7 1 (J.A 1144). The Account Control Agreements accordingly direct that Citibank \u201cshall comply with all instructions\u201d it receives from the grantees. Id. \u00a7 2 (J.A 1145). The grantees \u2019 title to the award funds is also reflected in USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 36 of 927Citibank \u2019 s Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury, which requires Citibank to act as the government \u2019 s \u201cfinancial agent\u201d to achieve Congress \u2019 s goal by, among other things, establishing \u201caccounts in the names of the three NCIF and five CCIA grant recipients\u201d and maintaining a \u201ccustomer relationship\u201d with each grantee. Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A \u00a7 I.A.1 (J.A 2145).Under those agreements, EPA retained a security interest in the grantees \u2019 award funds that allows it to assert control over the money in certain circumstances if\u2014and only if\u2014it issues a Notice of Exclusive Control, which it undisputedly has not done. Form of Notice of Exclusive Control (J.A 1152); Oral Arg. Tr. 28:6-22. EPA has only an unexercised security interest; it does not own the funds in the grantees \u2019 accounts. See United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U.S 198, 209-10 (1983); Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S 356, 392 n.8 (2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting the distinction between \u201cthe government possess[ing] merely a secured interest in the property\u201d and \u201cown[ing] the funds\u201d).In addition to serving as the mechanism for conveying to the grantees legal title to the award funds, the financial agent structure affords EPA greater oversight of the grantees \u2019 use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system: While EPA \u2019 s traditional disbursement system reports only the amounts withdrawn by the recipient and the remaining award funds, the financial agent structure allows EPA real-time \u201cview access,\u201d enabling it to see the grantees \u2019 and their subrecipients \u2019 accounts to follow how much they are spending, with all amounts broken down by budget category, and to see income in the form of portfolio earnings and loan repayments. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 33 (J.A 372). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 37 of 928Other oversight mechanisms provide further, detailed confirmation of grantees \u2019 lawful use of their funds. Grantees provide extensive reporting to EPA on their spending. They make quarterly, semi-annual, and annual written reports regarding their transactions and progress against their EPA-approved workplans, plus quarterly conflict-of-interest reporting. They attend oversight, planning, and compliance meetings with EPA at least weekly. They submit to EPA withdrawal certifications attesting to the propriety of each draw request to Citibank and to its necessity for their workplan. And grantees are also subject to third-party financial audits and audits for federal grant compliance. Id. \u00b6 35 (J.A 372-73).The plaintiffs in this suit are five of the eight NCIF and CCIA grantees, as well as several of their subgrantees. Since mid-2024, they have been putting the grant money to work, committing to loans for projects around the country that will, for example: \u2022 develop and renovate hundreds of energy-efficient affordable housing units; \u2022 fund low-cost loans to small business and homeowners to finance heating and cooling systems and backup battery storage; \u2022 build a fleet of 500 American-made electric trucks to be conveniently and affordably available for lease by small businesses and independent contractors; and \u2022 provide backup power sources to rural hospitals to reduce the risks of harm to patients due to power outages.Those projects will help cut energy costs for consumers and small businesses, create jobs, ameliorate the affordable-USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 38 of 929housing crisis, and improve air quality in low-income and less developed communities.Plaintiffs \u2019 projects provide benefits to people and communities the value of which is many times greater than their cost to the public fisc. Congress structured these programs to enable each dollar of public funding spent to attract multiple dollars of private funding. One Plaintiff, for example, estimates that it will generate up to $4 of private investment for every $1 of federal funds invested in projects. Another Plaintiff \u2019 s workplan obligates it to mobilize $14 of private investment for every $1 of federal funding awarded to the Plaintiff. As of December 2024, it had already achieved a private-public capital mobilization ratio of nearly 7:1. But those projects\u2014as well as many of the Plaintiffs \u2019 ability even to remain in business\u2014cannot continue without Plaintiffs \u2019 access to the funds EPA awarded them. Plaintiffs \u2019 vulnerability to the freeze of their federal grant money is particularly acute given that many of the Plaintiffs were formed specifically to participate in the grant programs and as such do not have other sources of funding.B. EPA \u2019 s ActionsEPA \u2019 s campaign to seize the grant money already owned by Plaintiffs began shortly after the new administration took office, in response to its directives. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14154. Exec. Order 14154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8357 (Jan. 29, 2025).

Nonetheless, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made clear his intent to take back the funds disbursed through those programs.On February 12, Zeldin released a public statement video in which he described the NCIF and CCIA grant programs as a \u201cscheme\u201d by the \u201cBiden EPA\u201d to \u201cpark[]\u201d 20 billion dollars at an outside financial institution in order to \u201cobligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight. \u201d Lee Zeldin (@EPALeeZeldin), X (Feb. 12, 2025, 7:52 PM), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP\">https://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP</url>.

The Justice Department officials admitted that those investigations had not \u201c uncover[ed] . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties \u201d that could justify the government \u2019 s interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 money but advised that, before the government would have to defend the freeze in court, it would \u201cmake . . . arguments about how those claims sound in contract and should be pursued in another forum. \u201d Id.The Justice Department recognized that, \u201c[a]t some point, we will need to raise defenses, but the criminal and civil investigations may fill that out over the intervening period. \u201d Id. That is, in the Justice Department \u2019 s candid estimation, the government had not turned up any wrongdoing that could justify its action to \u201cprevent disbursement of the grant funds. \u201d Id.

USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 44 of 9215In response to the Justice Department \u2019 s instructions, EPA sent a letter to Citibank the next day instructing it to \u201cpause the processing of payment instructions for the GGRF accounts until further notice. \u201d Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). EPA stated that it was \u201cworking to review and develop additional account controls to address concerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of interest related to the [GGRF], including based on incoming responses to oversight questions EPA issued to grant recipients on March 4, 2025,\u201d and asserted that \u201c[t]he GGRF is also the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the U.S Department of Justice and an investigation by the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG). \u201d Id.

EPA stated further that \u201c[t]his interim account control will be rescinded as soon as reasonably practicable once EPA completes its review and implements additional account controls through additional instructions as necessary. \u201d Id.Meanwhile, Plaintiffs had already been unable to access the money in their bank accounts for over two weeks\u2014a period that has now stretched to more than six months. And because the terms of the grant awards generally prohibited Plaintiffs from withdrawing funds unless they would be spent in the following fourteen business days, Plaintiffs were starting to run out of money to make payroll, pay the rent on their offices, and pay third-party contractors for essential auditing, legal, and IT security services. On top of that, without access to their funding, they would soon be unable to meet their commitments under loans for projects they had already agreed to finance. Some of those loan payments could be requested by borrowers at any time; if borrowers requested a loan draw-down while USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 45 of 9216Plaintiffs could not access their funds, Plaintiffs would be forced to default on those loans, imperiling the projects.Plaintiffs remained unable to access the money in their accounts. They repeatedly requested an explanation from EPA or Citibank as to why their funds were inaccessible. They received no substantive reply. Climate United, for example, sent three emails, left a voicemail, and mailed a hard-copy letter to Citibank between February 19 and March 3 before finally receiving a response stating only that Citibank had \u201c received [Climate United \u2019 s] correspondence \u201d and was \u201cawaiting further guidance\u201d from EPA. Bafford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-51 (J.A 376-78). When Climate United contacted EPA on February 20, the agency at first offered Climate United a meeting the following week, only to reschedule the meeting three times before cancelling it and becoming entirely non-responsive to Climate United \u2019 s efforts to get in touch.At the same time that EPA was refusing to respond to Plaintiffs \u2019 requests for information, Zeldin made multiple public statements in which he claimed to have \u201cseen [] a lot of self-dealing, a lot of conflicts of interest,\u201d described the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as a \u201cclear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and a \u201ccriminal\u201d scheme, and vowed that EPA was \u201cnot going to rest\u201d until it had \u201crecover[ed]\u201d the grant awards.1After three weeks of being kept in the dark without access to their funds, Plaintiffs \u201chad no choice but to sue. \u201d Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 14:8 (J.A 187).

When Climate United agreed to EPA \u2019 s request \u201cas a professional courtesy,\u201d EPA used the 24-hour delay to send each of the grantees identical letters stating that their grants were terminated, effective immediately. Climate United Fund v. Citibank, 775 F. Supp. 3d 335, 343 (D.D.C 2025); J.A 390-91 (termination letter). The government then argued that the case should be dismissed as moot because the relief Plaintiffs sought\u2014an injunction preventing EPA from terminating the awards\u2014was no longer available, as EPA had already purported to terminate the awards.Rejecting EPA \u2019 s attempt to moot the case, the district court granted a temporary restraining order. It found that EPA had failed to provide any logical explanation for terminating Plaintiffs \u2019 grant awards. Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at 346-48. Instead, in declarations and two live hearings before the district court, EPA cited allegations of criminal activity and fraud that the court held were unsupported by any credible evidence. Id. at 347-48; see also id. at 346 (\u201cEPA Defendants proffered no evidence to support their basis for the termination . . . . \u201d).

Id at 115-16.By the time the district court granted the preliminary injunction in mid-April, Plaintiffs \u2019 inability to access their funding threatened to permanently unravel projects that depended on funding commitments they had incurred before EPA \u2019 s actions to undo the GGRF. A project to renovate 192 affordable housing units in Virginia could lose its $4 million in committed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding if a subgrantee cannot fulfill its funding obligations by September. Donovan Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 437-38). Projects to construct a community health center in New Jersey and to renovate a historic hotel into 63 rental apartments in rural Iowa were slated to lose their state tax credits and collapse if they did not receive a subgrantee \u2019 s planned funding by July. Moon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 25-26 (J.A 465-67). And construction of 302 affordable housing units in Texas and 236 units in Maryland will not move forward, and will eventually collapse, without a subgrantee \u2019 s committed funding. Donovan Decl. \u00b6 17 (J.A 436-37).Those harms have only continued to mount as the funding freeze has persisted, and for some projects, it is likely already too late. Due to one subgrantee \u2019 s inability to access its grant funds, a 106-unit affordable housing renovation lost its state tax credits in May, increasing the project \u2019 s cost and placing the project in jeopardy. Mayopoulos Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, Climate United,USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 49 of 9220No. 25-cv-698, Dkt. No. 112-1 (D.D.C May 12, 2025) (hereinafter Mayopoulos Supp. Decl.). Another project to construct a 160-home subsidized rental apartment community in Detroit most likely lost its critical HUD housing assistance commitment because of a subgrantee \u2019 s inability to provide a promised $4 million bridge loan in June. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Brown Decl. \u00b6 18 (J.A 437). And a $34 million project to build 90 rental homes in Texas was projected to fall through due to a subgrantee \u2019 s inability to provide its $3.6 million of committed funding by the end of June. Moon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (J.A 465).In addition to undermining existing projects, EPA \u2019 s actions will soon put many of the Plaintiffs themselves out of business, preventing accomplishment of the projects Congress intended them to fund. Without access to their funding, Plaintiffs are unable to make payroll, pay their bills, or keep current on their rent. Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117-20. Due to EPA \u2019 s interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to make payroll, many employees have started looking for other jobs, left voluntarily, or been laid off. For instance, one Plaintiff has laid off or lost approximately 50% of its staff, and one of its subgrantees was \u201cforced to act financially as though the GGRF award does not exist\u201d by laying off 36 of its employees. Mayopoulos Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. And because Plaintiffs cannot pay their bills, third-party contractors have started to withdraw essential services, including critical accounting, financial management, and award compliance services. Simply put, without access to their funds, Plaintiffs cannot keep their doors open, much less honor their loan commitments.More harmful still, faced with EPA \u2019 s threats to claw back Plaintiffs \u2019 funds, existing partners have begun to shun Plaintiffs \u2019 funding offers, pulling out of near-final deals and stopping working on Plaintiffs \u2019 projects. After eight weeks of negotiations, an Alaska-based community finance institution USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 50 of 9221had agreed to a $10 million loan from one of the Plaintiffs; all that was left to officially close the deal was the board \u2019 s approval. Following EPA \u2019 s actions, the board refused to approve the loan. That same plaintiff had completed negotiations with a local green bank in the Midwest to help finance a different project, with only board approval outstanding. The board met the day after Zeldin \u2019 s February 12 comments on X and voted against the loan because of Zeldin \u2019 s public threats and vow to end the NCIF program. A philanthropic entity interested in investing $250 million in a partnership with one of the Plaintiffs broke off discussions following EPA \u2019 s actions. Co-investment and collaboration is critical to Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to carry out Congress \u2019 s directive to efficiently finance projects to benefit the public by lowering \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A).DISCUSSIONAn accurate understanding of the program Congress enacted, together with the complete lack of evidence to support EPA \u2019 s false assertions of improper use or deficient oversight of federal expenditures, confirms that the district court \u2019 s decision to preliminarily enjoin EPA \u2019 s unlawful actions is unassailable. Based on nothing more than the President \u2019 s announced vendetta against the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d EPA determined to cut off access to money that was already disbursed to Plaintiffs and that they were using\u2014pursuant to Congress \u2019 s explicit directions as implemented by EPA\u2014to expand access to solar- and electric-powered housing, cars, buildings, and power generation. The Constitution does not allow the President or his subordinate executive agencies to unilaterally decide to take back money that Congress has appropriated and the agency already lawfully spent merely USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 51 of 9222because the Executive Branch disagrees with Congress \u2019 s policy choices. Neither do the laws governing federal agencies allow them to initiate specious criminal investigations in hopes of digging up pretextual justifications to cover up that unconstitutional action, let alone rely on the very existence of those investigations to interfere with Plaintiffs \u2019 lawful use of their money.EPA \u2019 s violations of law are so clear that the agency hardly contests them. And the imminent, irreversible harm to Plaintiffs is incontrovertible. These circumstances cry out for preliminary injunctive relief, as the district court rightly recognized. The majority \u2019 s contrary conclusion accepts the government \u2019 s gambit to strip district courts of jurisdiction over the government \u2019 s blatant violations of basic principles of constitutional and administrative law.Plaintiffs received the funds at issue here via federal grant awards. Absent EPA \u2019 s unjustified interference, the money in Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts is theirs to spend in conformity with the terms of the funding agreement. The government has expressly and repeatedly disclaimed any allegation that Plaintiffs have violated those terms. Neither has EPA attempted to regain control of the money by asserting its security interest in Plaintiffs \u2019 funds.EPA has instead frozen and purported to terminate the grant awards based on shifting, post-hoc, and unsupported allegations. Plaintiffs thus challenge EPA \u2019 s actions as arbitrary and capricious, and based on pretextual justifications. In no way is that claim \u201cin essence\u201d a contract claim over which the district court lacks jurisdiction. The reality that Plaintiffs obtained the funds by government contract does not mean that claims they raise against the government \u2019 s interference with their lawful use of those funds sound in contract. Our bindingUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 52 of 9223precedent makes clear that just because Plaintiffs \u201cwould have no claims to assert\u201d if they had never received the funds through a grant does not mean that they assert a \u201ccontract right. \u201d Crowley Gov \u2019 t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1110 (D.C Cir. 2022).The court \u2019 s holding to the contrary is unsupportable. The court falls short today in its Article III duty to independently say what the law is and thereby hold the Executive Branch to account. Such \u201c[a]bdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design. \u201d Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S 417, 452 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring).A. Likelihood of Success1. APAEPA \u2019 s conduct is arbitrary and capricious. Agencies may not offer \u201ccontrived reasons\u201d for their decisions, Dep \u2019 t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S 752, 785 (2019), nor can they make any decision that \u201cruns counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S , Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S 29, 43 (1983). It is beyond dispute that an agency \u2019 s own patently unfounded criminal investigations against private companies cannot be invoked to justify the factually baseless and legally unauthorized taking of the companies \u2019 funds. By all indications, that is exactly what EPA did here.Following the President \u2019 s instructions to cut off funding to clean energy projects, EPA vowed to \u201creassume responsibility\u201d of the NCIF and CCIA grant funds. To that end, without probable cause to suspect any criminal wrongdoing related to the grant programs, EPA\u2014in coordination with the Justice Department and the FBI\u2014first pressured Citibank into USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 53 of 9224voluntarily freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts by referring to \u201cpossible criminal violations,\u201d including \u201c[c]onspiracy to defraud the United States\u201d and \u201cwire fraud. \u201d FBI Freeze Ltr. (J.A 99-101). Not satisfied that Citibank \u2019 s voluntary freeze would hold, the agencies attempted to open a criminal investigation into the grants and impose a freeze of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds based on suspected criminal conduct. When those efforts came to nothing, EPA instructed the agency \u2019 s Office of Inspector General to open a civil investigation, immediately sent the referral\u2014including its unfounded allegations of \u201cself-dealing, conflicts of interest, [and] extraordinarily unqualified recipients,\u201d J.A 105\u2014to Citibank, and instructed Citibank to keep the accounts frozen until EPA was able to establish sufficient account controls.When that account freeze expired, the agencies again referenced \u201cpotential fraud\u201d and ongoing criminal and civil investigations to Citibank as support for an indefinite continuation of its account freeze, ostensibly to enable EPA to evaluate Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions. Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). But the very next day\u2014weeks before those responses were due, and mere hours before a hearing on Climate United \u2019 s TRO motion\u2014EPA used the 24-hour delay, which it had requested as a \u201cprofessional courtesy,\u201d to abruptly announce its putative termination of all the NCIF and CCIA awards. EPA then argued that the court should dismiss Climate United \u2019 s suit as moot on the ground that EPA had terminated its grant.When EPA could not point the court to any evidence supporting its allegations of fraud, Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at 346-47, it changed its tune. EPA argued to the district court and then to us that it terminated the grants not because any \u201cparticular plaintiff has engaged in a particular act that constitutes fraud,\u201d but only because of \u201cEPA \u2019 s lack of USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 54 of 9225oversight tools to ensure that the money wasn \u2019 t abused. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 103:9-15; see also Apr. 2 PI Hr \u2019 g Tr. 39:4-15 (J.A 868). EPA insisted that its oversight concern did not in any way depend on Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct\u201d\u2014despite the termination letters \u2019 references to \u201cfraud, waste, and abuse\u201d as a basis for the termination. PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507); Termination Ltr. (J.A 390).Each of those actions is consistent with EPA \u2019 s unlawful pursuit of a \u201cshort-term objective [] to prevent disbursement of the grant funds\u201d that had nothing to do with any valid concerns about fraud or oversight, and everything to do with the agency \u2019 s desire to carry out President Trump \u2019 s directive to block implementation of Congress \u2019 s environmental policy. Mar. 9 Emails, <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA\">https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA</url>. That is demonstrated most clearly by EPA \u2019 s pursuit of criminal and civil investigations that it hoped would \u201c uncover . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties \u201d to substantiate its asserted justifications for freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. Id. It pursued those baseless (and fruitless) investigations against the advice of at least two experienced federal prosecutors the EPA consulted and the ruling of a magistrate judge that there was no probable cause to believe any improper conduct had occurred.Equally revealing is EPA \u2019 s double-speak: EPA claimed publicly and in communications to the parties that its actions were justified because the program is a \u201ccriminal\u201d scheme and a \u201cclear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d that is \u201criddled with self-dealing, conflicts of interest, extraordinarily unqualified recipients . . . and much more,\u201d even as EPA insisted to the district court, which rebuked it for utterly failing to substantiate those allegations, and to our court, that it was not \u201caccusing\u201d and has never \u201caccuse[d] the plaintiffs of waste, fraud and abuse. \u201d Apr. 2 PI Hr \u2019 g 39:12-13 (J.A 868); Oral Arg.

Such shifting and contradictory representations USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 55 of 9226further show that the oversight concerns EPA emphasizes as its sole basis for terminating the awards are post-hoc and pretextual. Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-21.The timing of the termination letters similarly undermines EPA \u2019 s purported oversight concerns. Only the day before terminating the grants, EPA instructed Citibank to extend the \u201cvoluntary\u201d funding freeze while it waited for Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions\u2014answers it claimed to need in order to evaluate \u201cconcerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of interest. \u201d Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). Later that day, Climate United moved for a TRO to prevent EPA from terminating the awards, among other requested relief. Instead of waiting for Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions\u2014which EPA had given Plaintiffs another several weeks to submit\u2014EPA abruptly terminated the grants the next day, less than 24 hours before the district court \u2019 s scheduled TRO hearing.That sequence of events\u2014terminate first, gather data later\u2014is emblematic of EPA \u2019 s approach throughout the events underlying this litigation. It is fundamentally at odds with the APA \u2019 s requirement of reasoned decision making. An agency must, at a minimum, \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. \u201d State Farm, 463 U.S at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted). By EPA \u2019 s own admission, it decided to terminate the awards before gathering the relevant oversight data, just as it decided to freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 money and launch criminal investigations without any reason to believe that Plaintiffs were engaged in \u201ccriminal conduct or other improprieties. \u201d Mar. 9 Emails. At every turn, EPA \u2019 s actions demonstrate that its purported reasons for terminating the grant\u2014its \u201c substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award progress, [and] USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 56 of 9227programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, \u201d Gov. Br. 33\u2014are entirely pretextual. Deciding the outcome before investigating the facts, unleashing the government \u2019 s prosecutorial power on private citizens with no basis to think fraud or crime occurred and, having uncovered no evidence, giving contrived and contradictory reasons for predetermined and unsupported agency action is quintessentially arbitrary and capricious. See Dep \u2019 t of Com., 588 U.S.at 782-85.EPA argues that it had legitimate concerns about its ability to ensure that the grant funds were being spent lawfully, making its decision to suddenly terminate the awards reasonable. Gov. Br. 33-34. But the oversight issues it cites are contradicted by the record. EPA \u2019 s explanation not only \u201cruns counter to the evidence before the agency\u201d and \u201cis so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,\u201d State Farm, 463 U.S at 43, but is patently pretextual.EPA points to the use of Citibank as a financial agent, the distribution of grant funding to subgrantee organizations, and modification of the agreement between the presidential election and inauguration as raising \u201cserious concerns\u201d about EPA \u2019 s ability to oversee Plaintiffs \u2019 use of the funds. Gov. Br. 9-11. From EPA \u2019 s telling, unqualified grantees were awarded enormous sums of federal grant funding with virtually no oversight. That narrative finds no support in the record.Start with EPA \u2019 s allegation that Plaintiffs are \u201cextraordinarily unqualified recipients\u201d who \u201chad no prior track record. \u201d Mar. 2 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 105); Gov. Br. 6. That is a grave mischaracterization. Recipients were coalitions of some of the country \u2019 s most reputable nonprofits with decades of relevant experience. They formed coalitions, structured as newly formed subsidiaries, to accommodate theUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 57 of 9228demands of the role that Congress envisioned for the grantees. That organizational design enables the subsidiary to adopt policies and structures most conducive to leveraging private capital\u2014one of Congress \u2019 s key goals for the program\u2014while benefitting from the experience and infrastructure of the parent organizations. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A 363). Climate United, for instance, is a coalition of three nonprofits with thirty to fifty years of experience each who have collectively managed nearly $30 billion of private and institutional capital to increase environmental sustainability. Id. \u00b6 7 (J.A 363). Power Forward Communities is a coalition of five nonprofits\u2014including household names like United Way and Habitat for Humanity\u2014with more than a century of combined experience financing, managing, and implementing affordable housing projects. Its coalition partners \u2019 past projects total more than $100 billion and have successfully added approximately 1.5 million affordable homes and apartments across the United States for Americans in need. Mayopoulos Decl. \u00b6 3 (J.A 452).Those coalitions are led by people of proven experience and integrity. Power Forward Communities itself is led by a former President and CEO of Fannie Mae who was also General Counsel of Bank of America; one of its subgrantees is led by a former director of the U.S Office of Management and Budget and HUD Secretary; and another of its subgrantees is led by a former Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo who also served as Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Such impressive leadership and proven track records make the coalitions eminently suited to fulfill Congress \u2019 s objectives. It is disingenuous of EPA to insinuate that the coalition structure implies Plaintiffs \u2019 lack of qualifications when it is \u201ccommon practice for established organizations to set up subsidiaries for specific projects and programs\u201d; coalition applicants were specifically invited toUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 58 of 9229apply for the grants by EPA; and the coalition partners and their leaders are extraordinarily qualified to administer the grant awards. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A 363); NOFO at 6 (J.A 1738). Nothing in the record materially disputes any of that.Nor do EPA \u2019 s purported concerns about conflicts of interest hold water. Start with the example selected by the majority. Maj. Op. 6 &amp; n.2 The majority highlights that, in urging its Office of Inspector General to open an investigation into the grant program, EPA \u2019 s Acting Deputy Administrator alleged that \u201cJahi Wise, the former director of the GGRF, personally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital [(CGC)]\u2014without recusing himself. \u201d Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A 107). But the record squarely contradicts that allegation. Consistent with \u201cEPA Order 5700.5A1, EPA \u2019 s Policy for Competition of Assistance Agreements, and the rigorous ethics and conflict-of-interest review carried out by EPA during the review and selection process for GGRF funding . . . Mr. Wise was recused from reviewing, evaluating, selecting, or approving funding on any grant competition for GGRF funding for which CGC submitted an application. \u201d Hopson Decl. \u00b6 22 (J.A 421). That is, in addition to recusing himself from CGC \u2019 s application for funding, \u201cMr. Wise did not even review applications from CGC \u2019 s competitors for GGRF funds. \u201d Id. Even EPA recognizes that its speculation about conflicts of interest does not support its termination decision. Indeed, after failing to present the district court with any evidence of fraud, conflicts of interest, or anything even approaching \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d EPA pivoted to argue that its decision to terminate the grants was solely \u201cbased on reasons of policy\u201d and did not have anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 59 of 9230EPA \u2019 s characterization of the grants \u2019 funding structure as an \u201cunusual and apparently improper\u201d \u201cscheme [to] remove[] $20 billion from governmental oversight in the days, weeks, and months before a new administration took office\u201d is similarly unfounded. Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A 107). As explained above, Plaintiffs received their awards as lump-sum payments which they held in accounts at Citibank, subject to a security interest held by EPA. That financial structure was specifically chosen to enable Plaintiffs to carry out Congress \u2019 s directive to act \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3). If the grant funds are to help attract private financing for clean energy projects, either by recruiting private co-investors or offering credit enhancements that make projects less risky for private investors, the funds need to be Plaintiffs \u2019 own assets and reflected on their balance sheets as such. See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 9-14; Bafford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32 (J.A 370-72). Under EPA \u2019 s standard grant disbursement system, in contrast, a recipient \u2019 s balance sheet reflects only the portions of the award that have already been expended, rather than the full award amount. Adherence to the agency \u2019 s default payment system would have impeded Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to recruit private capital. To effectuate Congress \u2019 s direction, EPA instead deposited the full award amount in Citibank accounts opened in Plaintiffs \u2019 and their subgrantees \u2019 names. That way, their balance sheets reflected Plaintiffs \u2019 ownership of the full amount of the award, even as they drew down funds from the account only as needed and in compliance with their obligations to fund projects and cover administrative costs.That funding mechanism was contemplated by EPA as early as July 2023\u2014long before any potential change in administration. See NOFO 55-56 (J.A 1787-88) (contemplating departures from standard EPA practice, including a \u201cone-time or periodic balance-sheet USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 60 of 9231capitalization(s)\u201d). And there is nothing improper about it. Rather, \u201cfederal financial agents\u201d like Citibank are \u201croutinely appointed\u201d and are specifically authorized by statute. Transactive Corp. v. United States, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C Cir. 1996); 12 U.S.C \u00a7 265. Most relevant to EPA \u2019 s litigating position, the financial agent structure affords EPA more oversight than the agency \u2019 s standard payment system. Citibank \u2019 s interface displays these grantees \u2019 and subgrantees \u2019 expenditures broken down by budget category and provides EPA with full, real-time view access into each of the grantees \u2019 and subgrantees \u2019 accounts. Those oversight features are absent from EPA \u2019 s standard disbursement system, which reports only the amount of money drawn down by the recipient. EPA \u2019 s determination that the \u201cprior administration \u2019 s designation of a financial agent . . . untenably reduced EPA \u2019 s oversight\u201d has it backwards. Gov. Br. 10.In the same vein, EPA asserts that, because some subgrantees may distribute award funds to other entities, EPA lacks the \u201cvisibility to see how [the subgrantees are] making those decisions or how that money is being used. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 34:2-4; see also Gov. Br. 10. That concern inexplicably disregards the many ways in which EPA can oversee the subgrantees \u2019 activities. EPA approved detailed budgets and workplans that specify how the subgrantees will use the grant money. Just like the grantees, every subgrantee must certify, under threat of \u201cprosecution under 18 U.S.C 1001 and other applicable criminal, civil and administrative sanctions,\u201d that each requested withdrawal of funds from its Citibank account is \u201cnecessary to execute against the workplan for the Subaward Agreement supported with EPA funding. \u201d Subgrantee Account Control Agreement, Ex. B (J.A 1189). And subgrantees \u2019 progress against that workplan is tracked and reported in quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports to EPA. For instance, Rewiring Community Investment Fund\u2014aUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 61 of 9232Power Forward Communities subgrantee\u2014describes how its inability to access its funding will prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its EPA-approved workplan, which include \u201cestablish[ing] a loan loss reserve to encourage lenders to provide loans with significantly discounted interest rates\u201d to households for energy-efficient, clean heating and cooling systems. Matusiak Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 447). Moreover, many of the subgrantees are financial institutions that are themselves subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators. JCF Ltr. at 3 (May 21, 2025).To the extent EPA takes issue with the fact that grantees may provide \u201csubgrants to others, who then pass it through to others,\u201d that is the structure that Congress, not the prior administration, chose to adopt. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(b)(2) (\u201cThe eligible recipient shall provide funding\u201d to \u201centities that provide financial assistance to qualified projects at the State, local, territorial, or Tribal level or in the District of Columbia, including community- and low-income-focused lenders and capital providers. \u201d).Tellingly, when one of the Plaintiffs responded to EPA \u2019 s asserted concerns about its ability to oversee subgrantees by proposing restructuring the $770 million of its grant funding that was slated for distribution to subgrantee community lenders, EPA ignored it. JCF Ltr. at 2-3. Under the proposal, the vast majority of the Plaintiff \u2019 s money would remain unspent in a segregated trust or escrow account that EPA could monitor. Instead of being distributed to the community lenders to lend directly, the funds would be used to secure the loans made by those community lenders to small businesses and communities looking to finance clean energy projects. In that way, the grant funds could have advanced the programs \u2019 goals USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 62 of 9233while largely staying put in an account monitored by EPA. EPA did not respond to the letter, despite repeated follow-up from the Plaintiff. Id. at 1. That lack of engagement further suggests that EPA \u2019 s purported oversight concerns are not the real reason it terminated Plaintiffs \u2019 grant awards.At bottom, each of EPA \u2019 s specific examples of oversight concerns is refuted by the record. And its broad-brush argument is simply untenable in light of the detailed oversight mechanisms available to EPA. EPA \u2019 s assertions that it had such grave oversight concerns that it had to cancel the grant awards overnight run aground on a conceded lack of any indication that Plaintiffs were out of compliance with the award terms, let alone that they were engaging in any conflicts of interest, fraud, or criminal activity. In addition to the real-time visibility Citibank provides EPA into Plaintiffs \u2019 and their subgrantees \u2019 accounts, EPA receives quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports detailing Plaintiffs \u2019 transactions, activities, progress against their workplans, and expenditures by budget category, as well as mandatory quarterly conflict-of-interest reporting by Plaintiffs and their subgrantees. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 35(a) (J.A 373). Before it purported to halt the program and itself disengaged from constructive communication, EPA had also held meetings with Plaintiffs \u201cat least weekly, and, at times, two to three times per week,\u201d to discuss their \u201cprogram plans, reporting, oversight, and compliance with the EPA Terms and Conditions. \u201d Id. \u00b6 35(b) (J.A 373); Arabshahi Decl. \u00b6 34 (J.A 1981). On top of those controls, Plaintiffs are subject to third-party audits and to \u201ctransaction testing\u201d by EPA, in which EPA conducts a \u201csystematic examination and verification of every dollar spent by [the grantee] to ensure they comply with the grant \u2019 s terms, conditions, and applicable regulations. \u201d Bafford Decl. \u00b6 35(g), (h) (J.A 373). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 63 of 9234EPA and the majority make much of the fact that the grant awards were amended in December 2024 and January 2025, claiming that these \u201clast-minute\u201d modifications in the waning days of the Biden administration were implemented to \u201cmake it more difficult for the government to terminate the agreements. \u201d Maj. Op. 5; see Gov. Br. 10, 34. EPA specifically contends that the original terms of the awards allowed it to terminate them \u201cbased on [a] change in policy priorities,\u201d per the version of EPA \u2019 s General Terms and Conditions in place before October 2024\u2014a contention the majority credits. Oral Arg. Tr. 102:17-25; see Maj. Op. 5 n. 1. That is incorrect.The original grant agreements, signed in August 2024\u2014months before the election\u2014already incorporated the termination provision from EPA \u2019 s now-operative General Terms and Conditions. Those General Terms and Conditions allow terminations of federal awards based on a change in policy priorities only when that basis for termination is \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d set forth in the award agreement itself. 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4), (b) (emphasis added). (Neither the EPA nor the majority contends that the award agreement itself, apart from the referenced regulation, allows the awards to be terminated based on a change in policy priorities.) The December 2024 amendment to the grant award thus did not alter the permissible bases for termination, which had never allowed termination for changed policy priorities.Plaintiffs \u2019 original award agreements specifically stated that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the General Term and Condition \u2018Termination, \u2019 [otherwise in effect before October 1, 2024,] EPA maintains the right to terminate the Assistance Agreement only as specified in . . . the version of 2 CFR 200.340 applicable to EPA grants as of July 1, 2024, pursuant to 89 Fed. Reg. 55262 (July 3, 2024). \u201d J.A 552 (emphasis added). The USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 64 of 9235version of the regulation the awards incorporated from the outset was the one providing \u201cthat an agency may terminate a Federal award if it no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities (e.g unilateral termination) but only when such language is clearly and unambiguously included in the terms and conditions of the award,\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 55,262, 55,263 (July 3, 2024) (emphasis added).EPA adopted that constraint pursuant to OMB \u2019 s invitation to agencies to opt into the revised rule before its default October 1, 2024, effective date. As of July 2024, EPA announced in the Federal Register that it had \u201cdecided to apply the revised version of 2 CFR 200.340 to EPA financial assistance agreements awarded or amended to add funds on or after July 1, 2024. \u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 55263. The December amendment thus imposed no new limit on EPA \u2019 s \u201ccontrol over [the] grant funding. \u201d Gov. Br. 10.The timing of the amendment also is entirely innocuous. EPA had explained shortly after the awards were announced in April 2024 that it would share draft award terms that month, and that it \u201cexpected the terms to change based on awardee feedback, to ensure they were clear and would be viable for awardee workplans. \u201d Bafford Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 367). EPA accordingly planned to communicate a \u201cfinal\u201d set of award terms in late June, followed by an iterative process during the fall and winter of 2024 in which EPA would receive grantees \u2019 suggested modifications based on their experience implementing the programs. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17-20 (J.A 366-68). Despite EPA \u2019 s and the majority \u2019 s insinuations to the contrary, nothing about the timing or content of those amendments supports Defendants \u2019 assertion that they were intended to reduce the agency \u2019 s oversight or control in the next administration. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 65 of 9236Neither does the \u201cgold bars\u201d video, which Zeldin repeatedly referenced in public comments smearing Plaintiffs, provide any plausible basis for sincere oversight concerns on the part of EPA \u2019 s new leadership. In the November 2024 Project Veritas video, an EPA staffer is shown saying to a peer on a Tinder date (who was surreptitiously filming him) that EPA was \u201ctrying to get the money out as fast as possible\u201d before Trump \u2019 s inauguration.

Whatever the staffer may have meant, those comments cannot have been referring to awards under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund because those had been fully obligated as of August 2024 (in accordance with Congress \u2019 s September 2024 deadline). \u201cEPA Awards $27B in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Grants to Accelerate Clean Energy Solutions, Combat the Climate Crisis, and Save Families Money,\u201d EPA (Aug. 16, 2024), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A\">https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A</url>. Anyone with a basic familiarity with the GGRF program would understand that a video of a staffer \u2019 s bluster at a bar in November is irrelevant to the grants at issue here.In sum, the record makes clear that EPA \u2019 s abrupt termination of the grant awards on the eve of the TRO hearing cannot rationally be explained by reference to the agency leadership \u2019 s professed oversight concerns. That alone shows that the agency violated the APA, as EPA \u2019 s explanation for its decision to terminate the awards \u201cruns counter to the evidence before\u201d it. State Farm, 463 U.S at 43. Far more troubling, EPA \u2019 s dogged pursuit of criminal investigations unsupported by probable cause and its unsubstantiated public accusations of criminal activity strongly suggest that the agency \u2019 s professed oversight concerns are pretextual. EPA \u2019 s refusals to discuss its declared concerns with Plaintiffs themselves, engage with their responses, or even wait to consider how they would answer its USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 66 of 9237oversight questions give the lie to its widely trumpeted concerns. Contrived, baseless justifications for the grant terminations do not satisfy the \u201creasoned explanation requirement of administrative law,\u201d which \u201cis meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public. \u201d Dep \u2019 t of Com., 588 U.S at 785.

Our constitutional system of separation of powers rests on the idea that national \u201cpolicy is for Congress and the President to establish as they see fit in enacting statutes, and for the President and subordinate executive agencies . . . to implement within statutory boundaries. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 257. \u201cMoney is the instrument of policy,\u201d Clinton, 524 U.S at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring), and it is Congress\u2014not the executive branch acting unilaterally\u2014that has \u201cexclusive power over the federal purse,\u201d Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. E.P.A , 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C Cir. 1992). Only Congress may authorize \u201cmoney [to] be paid out of the Treasury. \u201d Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S 308, 321 (1937). And when it does so, the executive \u201cmay not ignore\u201d those funding directives \u201cmerely because of policy disagreement with Congress. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260.To hold otherwise would allow \u201cthe executive [to] possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation,\u201d 2USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 67 of 9238JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \u00a7 1348, at 215 (Thomas Cooley ed., 4th ed. 1873)\u2014the very concentration of power the Appropriations Clause was intended to prevent. See Cincinnati Soap Co., 301 U.S at 321. It is thus incontrovertible that, \u201c[a]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals. \u201d City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018). As then-Judge Kavanaugh explained, it is a \u201csettled, bedrock principle[] of constitutional law\u201d that neither the President nor his \u201csubordinate executive agencies\u201d may \u201cdecline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259. Insofar as the majority defends a prerogative of EPA to cancel the grants for policy reasons, the majority \u2019 s assertion that \u201cthe [Inflation Reduction] Act does not limit the Administrator \u2019 s discretion to withhold or terminate grants,\u201d Maj. Op. 23, squarely conflicts with Aiken.Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act appropriated federal funds for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and instructed EPA \u201cto make grants\u201d by September 30, 2024, to \u201cnonprofit organization[s] that [are] designed to provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial assistance for the rapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (providing funds \u201cto remain available until September 30, 2024\u201d and instructing EPA to make the described grants), (c)(1)(A) (specifying that \u201celigible recipients\u201d must be able to leverage private capital). The statute specifies that grantees, working in partnership with the private sector and with local communities, must provide funding and other assistance to housing and infrastructure projects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Id.USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 68 of 9239\u00a7 7434(b). EPA is constitutionally obligated to administer those grants; it cannot unilaterally decide to get rid of the grant programs based on the Administration \u2019 s policy preference to \u201c[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal. \u201d 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357.The district court found that EPA sought to do just that. It found that \u201cEPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter,\u201d as shown by EPA \u2019 s public expressions of determination to shut down the grant program, and as confirmed by its action to terminate \u201call eight grants comprising the entire NCIF and CCIA programs. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The district court \u2019 s factfinding is amply supported by the record, and the majority \u2019 s conclusion that it was clearly erroneous cannot be squared with EPA \u2019 s remarkable conduct in this case. Maj. Op. 25-26.As already discussed, EPA \u2019 s actions at every turn reveal its determination to permanently defund the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs for no more reason than that President Trump announced that goal. See 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357 (directing agencies to \u201cTerminat[e] the Green New Deal\u201d by preventing the \u201cdisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act\u201d). Without any further planning, consideration, or explanation, EPA acted to prevent Plaintiffs from accessing their funds. Current agency leadership has demonized the recipients as if the President \u2019 s policy preferences alone license them to slander as fraudulent or criminal any grantee whose activities do not align with those preferences. No matter that all evidence confirms that Plaintiffs were spending their money precisely as Congress intended and authorized.Indeed, EPA \u2019 s hasty decisions to freeze and terminate the grant awards with no evidence of noncompliance and no communication with Plaintiffs cannot be explained as anything USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 69 of 9240other than a decision to do what the President said he wanted only because he said so. The decision to terminate the grants just hours before the district court had a scheduled occasion to rule on whether to restore or preserve Plaintiffs \u2019 access to their award funds is hard to explain as anything but a bald effort to rewrite the statute and undo what was done in compliance with it. Those are not legitimate means to advance the new President \u2019 s policy agenda. Why terminate grant awards that had been made and were being carried out as Congress intended unless EPA \u2019 s real disagreement was with Congress \u2019 s legislated policy choice to fund \u201cgreen energy\u201d projects?The majority chides the district court for discounting EPA \u2019 s representations that it intended to reconstitute the grant programs with increased oversight. Maj. Op. 25-26. At oral argument, EPA disavowed any \u201cfrontal assault on the appropriation or Congress \u2019 s objective,\u201d insisting that the agency \u201cintends, as consistent with principles of appropriations law, to continue to make these funds available in a permissible way and in a way that comports with the oversight principles that it thinks are important here. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. at 25. But, as discussed below, since the appropriation \u2019 s deadline to obligate the funds has passed, EPA retains at most a narrow authority to make \u201creplacement\u201d grants and cannot obligate the funds anew.In any event, the district court had ample basis not to credit EPA \u2019 s representations that it will spend the funds as Congress intended. The court observed EPA \u2019 s track record throughout this case of making slanderous and insupportable public statements and disavowing them in court in favor of self-serving contradictory representations. The court knew that EPA instigated unsupported criminal and civil investigations to hunt for justifications to claw back Plaintiffs \u2019 money and observed that the agency remained unable to provide any USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 70 of 9241evidence to support its very public assertions of mismanagement and insufficient oversight. Presented with EPA \u2019 s actions and its patent inability to justify them on any other basis, the district court was on unassailably solid evidentiary footing in finding that EPA \u2019 s actions had nothing to do with its professed oversight concerns. EPA simply sought to \u201cdismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115.EPA \u2019 s \u201crepeated[] represent[ations] that it planned to re-commit the funds,\u201d Maj. Op. 23, ring entirely hollow in light of its patent inability to do so. See Bagenstos Amicus Br. 3-11. It is an \u201celementary principle\u201d of federal appropriations law that \u201ca federal agency \u2019 s budget authority lapses on the last day of the period for which funds were obligated. \u201d W. Va. Ass \u2019 n of Cmty. Health Ctrs, Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C Cir. 1984). Here, Congress specified that the appropriation for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund would \u201cremain available until September 30, 2024. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a)(1), (2), (3). The appropriation thus expired on that date, after which EPA could no longer use the funding to incur new obligations. See Off. of Nat. Res. Revenue-Coop. Agreements, B-321297, 2011 WL 3343023, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Aug. 2, 2011).Federal appropriations law thus bars EPA from terminating the awards and then re-obligating the funds to reconstitute the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs. \u201cIf an agency deobligates funds after the expiration of the period of availability, the funds are not available for new obligations. \u201d Continued Availability of Expired Appropriation for Additional Project Phases, B-286929, 2001 WL 717355, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Apr. 25, 2001). In other words, once EPA terminates the grant awards, it will no longer have the authority to make new grant awards to fulfill its statutory obligations. The majority suggests that Congress \u2019 s repeal last month of the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 71 of 9242Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could affect EPA \u2019 s asserted authority to recommit the funds and thereby relieve it of any obligation to do so. Maj. Op. 25 n. 11. It does neither. The statute rescinds only \u201cunobligated\u201d funds: Obligated funds, like those at issue here, are unaffected. One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Pub. L. No. 119-21, \u00a7 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 155 (2025). See generally July 7, 2025, Neitzel Ltr. to Clerk of Court Cislak (noting that Senator Capito described the proposition that OBBBA might \u201cclaw back money\u201d as \u201cridiculous\u201d) (quoting Josh Siegel, Q&amp;A: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, incoming EPW chair, (Nov. 20, 2024), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9\">https://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9</url>). It is the federal appropriations rule, not the repeal legislation, that prevents EPA from recommitting the funds.EPA \u2019 s assertions that it will nonetheless fulfill Congress \u2019 s plan by labeling its re-obligations as \u201creplacement grants,\u201d Reply Br. 17, are empty promises. The majority, too, cites replacement-grant authority as evidence of EPA \u2019 s intent to continue the program with new grantees rather than terminate it. Maj. Op. 24 &amp; n.10 To qualify as a replacement grant, the re-obligation would have to be \u201csubstantially identical in scope and purpose to the original grant. \u201d The Honorable Lawton Chiles U.S Senate, B-164031, 1976 WL 10353, at *4 (Comp. Gen. June 25, 1976). Those requirements cannot be met by new grants that materially alter the financial structure, number of grantees, or other oversight controls\u2014meaning that EPA would have to retain the very features it claims prompted the agency to interfere with Plaintiffs \u2019 grants. See NRDC Amicus Br. 9-13.The majority reasons that, because \u201cthere is no evidence the agency sought to dismantle the programs without congressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees \u2019 claims. \u201d Maj. Op. 26. The majority \u2019 s factual premise USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 72 of 9243is unsupported, and the validity of Plaintiffs \u2019 separation of powers claim follows from Aiken County. We held in Aiken County that executive agencies violate the constitutional separation of powers when they refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress because they disagree with Congress \u2019 s policy choice. 725 F.3d at 260. There, as here, Congress appropriated funds for a particular effort (there, assessing applications to store nuclear waste; here, making competitive grants) and set a statutory deadline for the agency to act. Id. at 257-58. When the agency refused to adhere to the statute due to \u201cpolicy disagreement[s] with Congress,\u201d we held that refusal violated the Constitution, posing a threat to undermine \u201cour constitutional system of separation of powers\u201d that supported judicial intervention. Id. at 260, 267.EPA \u2019 s attempts to dismantle the statutorily mandated NCIF and CCIA programs due to the current agency leadership \u2019 s policy disagreements with Congress run afoul of the Constitution in the same way. In rejecting Plaintiffs \u2019 separation of powers claim, the majority says that it is \u201cdeclin[ing] to adopt a principle that would convert every statutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim. \u201d Maj. Op. 23. That may well be advisable, but it does not describe the rule of Aiken County that properly applies here. The majority cannot choose to \u201cdecline\u201d to apply our binding precedent. Wherever the line between constitutional and statutory claims lies, Aiken County squarely holds that EPA \u2019 s actions violated the Constitution.B. Irreparable Injury and Balance of EquitiesBaseless allegations of fraudulent or criminal activity, coupled with EPA \u2019 s unfounded interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 grant funds, threaten enormous harm to Plaintiffs and, more importantly, to the communities, businesses, and individuals USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 73 of 9244across the United States who stand to benefit from the uses of the money that Congress prescribed. Without access to their grant awards, Plaintiffs are already out of money to make payments for rent, third-party contractors, and insurance policies critical to continue operating, and many of the Plaintiffs will permanently shutter in the coming months. Plaintiffs have already been forced to defer compensation for, lay off, withdraw offers from, and lose employees with specialized expertise that \u201ccannot be replaced easily, if at all. \u201d Supp. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 7 (J.A 954).Absent funding from Plaintiffs, major projects already underway will fold\u2014projects intended to create demand for and boost the global competitiveness of U.S advanced electric manufacturing capability, provide critically necessary affordable housing and infrastructure, lower energy costs, improve air quality, and reduce climate risks across the United States. If the agency succeeds in taking back the funding provided under the Act, many of those projects will not be able to raise capital from other sources and will irrevocably fail. That is particularly likely because Congress directed grantees to invest in \u201cqualified projects that would otherwise lack access to financing. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(b)(1). As just a single example, one subgrantee community lender has set up projects to install clean-energy microgrids at churches, community centers, and nursing homes in rural Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama to provide sustained power during outages of existing power sources. Without the subgrantee \u2019 s promised funds, those projects are at risk of being left undone. The projects were intended to provide vulnerable populations with \u201cenergy independent safe havens for residents and community members\u201d during increasingly common extreme weather events; instead, when blackouts inevitably happen, \u201c[o]xygen machines that would be powered by solar panels during a blackout will turn off\u201d and \u201c[e]ssential medications that require USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 74 of 9245refrigeration will warm and spoil. \u201d Parker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37 (J.A 950).EPA \u2019 s unlawful actions are not just an enormous loss to Plaintiffs and the American people. They defy Congress \u2019 s objectives for authorizing and funding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund: to provide financial assistance to pollution-reducing projects \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 (c)(3)(A). By directing Citibank to freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 money, the government is making it impossible for Plaintiffs to serve as reliable funding partners, ruining their prospects for securing future partnerships, favorable loan terms, qualified staff, and federal grant funding. As one Plaintiff explained:To be an effective financing counterparty, CGC (or any organization) must have certainty of funding sources, be able to move efficiently and reliably in negotiations, and be viewed as credible by involved parties. CGC is made ineffective if potential partners cannot rely on when CGC \u2019 s capital will become available. No credible counterparty will take this funding risk, or be willing to be associated financially with CGC.Kauffman Decl. \u00b6 13 (J.A 429). That reputational harm is devastating to Plaintiffs. Because \u201cpart of [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] purpose is to bridge market failures and attract private co-investment to projects that might otherwise be deemed too risky, confidence in [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] commitments as . . . investor[s] is vital to achieving buy-in from private sector investors. . . . The longer the freeze on [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] funds continues, the more difficult it will be for [them] to originate deals and secure co-investors. \u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23 (J.A 430-31). Worse, the agency \u2019 s action contrary to Congress \u2019 enactment sets off a cycle of skepticism. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 75 of 9246When Plaintiffs \u2019 hard-won partnerships with private investors and community lenders initially hesitant to fund clean-energy projects evaporate, those partners will be all the more reluctant to invest in similar ventures in the future. Plaintiffs \u201chave had to work hard to build relationships and to earn a reputation as [] trustworthy, reliable lending institution[s],\u201d and the \u201cknock-on effects\u201d of the damage EPA has caused to their reputations \u201cwill delay adoption and therefore achievement of GGRF \u2019 s mission. \u201d Parker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (J.A 947).These harms are the very definition of irreparable injury. Once a lender \u2019 s reputation as a stable source of promised funding is compromised, it is difficult, if not impossible, to repair. Indeed, investors and loan applicants have already pulled out of near-final agreements due to the uncertainty over whether Plaintiffs will be able to access their funds. Projects underway that miss key deadlines due to Plaintiffs \u2019 inability to make good on their loan commitments will be shut down permanently.More broadly, the distrust bred by EPA \u2019 s actions will make it exceedingly difficult to revive the coordination and cooperation between nonprofit organizations, private investors, private businesses, and community lenders critical to carrying out Congress \u2019 s objective of building important projects at low public cost by spending government grant money to leverage private investment. What is more, without a court-ordered injunction, the government \u2019 s actions portend that EPA will drain the money from Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts with no apparent avenue for Plaintiffs to reclaim it. Once EPA successfully terminates the awards and moves the funds back to Treasury\u2014as it intends to do as soon as the district court \u2019 s injunction is lifted, see Oral Arg. Tr. 4:14-16\u2014it is unlikely that a court would be able to order their return to Plaintiffs or take any other action to fulfill the agency \u2019 s congressional mandate. See City USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 76 of 9247of Houston, Tex. v. Dep \u2019 t of Hous. &amp; Urb. Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426 (D.C Cir. 1994) (explaining that \u201ca court cannot reach\u201d funds that have reverted to Treasury \u201cin order to award relief\u201d when the appropriation authorizing their expenditure has expired); 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (appropriations for GGRF grant programs expired on September 30, 2024); see also generally Bagenstos Amicus Br. (explaining that EPA cannot re-obligate the grant funds, nor can a court order it to do so, because the appropriation authorizing those funds expired in September 2024). Under such circumstances, any eventual judicial declaration that the terminations were unlawful would be a hollow victory.On the other side of the ledger, the government claims that allowing Plaintiffs to access their funding will cause \u201csubstantial and irreparable harm to the public fisc. \u201d Gov. Br. 41. But as the government itself submits, its \u201cbases for termination were the grants \u2019 structure and terms\u201d which \u201creflected no more than a decision based on reasons of policy,\u201d not anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government insists that it is \u201cnot accusing anybody of fraud. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 27:16. That is, the government no longer disputes that Plaintiffs are using the award funds as initially instructed by EPA, and as mandated by Congress. It is hard to see how the public is harmed by Plaintiffs \u2019 use of money allotted by Congress to carry out its duly enacted policies.C. Tucker ActThe government attempts to divert this court \u2019 s attention from its brazenly unlawful actions by arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claims. But the district court at a minimum had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 77 of 9248meritorious separation of powers claim. That alone provides jurisdiction for the preliminary injunction.In any event, the majority \u2019 s conclusion that the Tucker Act bars Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA is wrong. Plaintiffs are not seeking reinstatement of their grant awards or any other form of specific performance of contracts. Nor are they seeking payment of funds from the Treasury. Their suit challenges the government \u2019 s decision to illegally seize their property\u2014money in bank accounts opened in their names, in which the government has only a security interest (which it has not exercised). The grant awards define that money as \u201cgross income earned by\u201d Plaintiffs, meaning that title to the money passed to Plaintiffs when the award funds were deposited in their Citibank accounts. Grant Award at 53 (J.A 1134) (quoting 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.1).Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the funds in their accounts is cemented by the Account Control Agreements between Citibank, EPA, and each grantee, which specify that Citibank \u201cmaintains the Accounts for [Plaintiffs],\u201d and that Plaintiffs are \u201cthe entitlement holder[s] with respect to all financial assets credited from time to time to the Accounts. \u201d J.A 1144. Citibank \u2019 s status as a \u201cfiduciary of the government,\u201d Maj. Op. 14\u2014in which capacity it promises to maintain accounts for Plaintiffs, allow them to \u201caccess and use funds\u201d in their accounts, and provide view access to EPA, Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A \u00a7\u00a7 I.A.1, I.D.1 (J.A 2145, 2149)\u2014changes nothing about Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the money in their accounts. That Citibank has a contractual obligation to the government to serve as a custodian of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds does not mean that the government owns the funds.Indeed, Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the award funds, which allows the award to serve as a liquid asset instead of an inherently USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 78 of 9249risky \u201cexpected income stream,\u201d is critical to Congress \u2019 s decision to equip grantees to attract private investment and is one of the reasons EPA selected the financial agent structure. Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 7-14. Plaintiffs thus seek an equitable remedy \u201cfor the recovery of specific property or monies,\u201d which stands in contradistinction to money damages, Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S 879, 893 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added), the \u201cprototypical contract remedy,\u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107.The nature of the relief that Plaintiffs seek\u2014recovery of property that is lawfully theirs\u2014suffices to resolve the Tucker Act question against the government. Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S 731 (1947), reflects that longstanding principle. There, the plaintiff sought an injunction preventing the U.S Maritime Commission from selling shares of stock that the plaintiff alleged it owned under a contract with the Commission. Id. at 734. The Court held that the district court had jurisdiction over the case even though the plaintiff \u2019 s alleged right to the disputed property originated in a contract and depended on interpreting the contract in its favor. The Court nonetheless recognized that the plaintiff \u2019 s \u201cclaim rests on [its] right under general law to recover possession of specific property wrongfully withheld\u201d\u2014a claim sounding in tort, not contract. Id. at 735-36. That was so even though the government possessed and had \u201crecord title\u201d to the property. Id. at 737. As the Court explained:[P]ublic officials may become tort-feasors by exceeding the limits of their authority. And where they unlawfully seize or hold a citizen \u2019 s realty or chattels, recoverable by appropriate action at law or in equity, he is not relegated to the Court of Claims to recover a money judgment. The dominant interest of the sovereign is then on the side of the victim whoUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 79 of 9250may bring his possessory action to reclaim that which is wrongfully withheld.Id. at 738.We acknowledged in Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis the line drawn in Land v. Dollar between claims to property acquired by contract\u2014which may proceed in district court\u2014and claims to enforce rights to contractual proceeds, which must proceed in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act: \u201cThe Supreme Court many years ago recognized a private party \u2019 s cause of action outside the Tucker Act to challenge the statutory authority of federal officials to claim ownership rights in property allegedly transferred during the course of a contract. \u201d 672 F.2d at 968-69. That principle confirms the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction here. Moreover, these cases underscore that a claim to recover property need not be framed as an unconstitutional taking to proceed in district court.Plaintiffs claim that EPA has unlawfully interfered with their previously disbursed funds in violation of, inter alia, the APA. Appellee Br. at 15. Plaintiffs assert that EPA has \u201cunlawfully seize[d]\u201d their property, and they seek an injunction to \u201creclaim that which is wrongfully withheld. \u201d Dollar, 330 U.S at 738. This case is even clearer in that regard than Land v. Dollar itself, because the government has neither title to nor possession of the disputed funds. Plaintiffs \u2019 action is one to recover their property. It does not seek any money from the Treasury. It is not a contract action so is not \u201crelegated to the Court of Claims. \u201d Id. As in Megapulse, Plaintiff \u2019 s \u201cposition is ultimately based, not on breach of contract, but on an alleged governmental infringement of property rights and violation of [a statute]. \u201d 672 F.2d at 969.The Supreme Court itself recently recognized that distinction in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine AdvocacyUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 80 of 9251Coalition, where it declined to stay a district court order requiring the government to issue payments owed to plaintiffs for foreign aid work they had already completed. 145 S. Ct. 753 (2025). The government argued there, as here, that the plaintiffs essentially sought to enforce a government contract so must proceed, if at all, in the Court of Claims. See id. at 756 (Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., dissenting from the denial of the application to vacate the district court \u2019 s order). The Court was unpersuaded that the government thus was likely to establish a sovereign immunity bar against the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction. Id. at 753. Like the grantees here, the plaintiffs in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition brought APA and constitutional challenges to defendants \u2019 interference with their existing entitlement to grant funding. Their claims depended not on breach of their contracts, but on the unlawfulness of the government \u2019 s actions. The district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 APA and constitutional claims here is even clearer than it was in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, because here, unlike there, payment was already made.Those same facts\u2014that Plaintiffs seek an injunction preventing the government from interfering with money the government has already properly disbursed to them\u2014renders inapplicable the Supreme Court \u2019 s emergency stay orders in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Ass \u2019 n, No. 25-A-103, 2025 WL 2415669 (Aug. 21, 2025), and Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025). I respect the reasoning of those orders where they apply, but no part of the district court \u2019 s injunction in this case \u201corder[s] the payment of money\u201d from the Treasury or requires the government to \u201cpay out past-due grant obligations\u201d or to \u201ccontinue paying obligations as they accrue. \u201d Dep \u2019 t of Ed., 145 S. Ct. at 968. And, unlike plaintiffs in National Institutes of Health, Plaintiffs here need not seek to enforce theUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 81 of 9252government \u2019 s \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d 2025 WL 2415669, at *1, because these Plaintiffs \u2019 money was already paid before Defendants interfered with it.Rather, what Plaintiffs seek here is to unfreeze their funds and to enjoin EPA from unlawfully interfering with them based on the President \u2019 s announced policy disagreement with Congress \u2019 s objectives. In doing so, Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s decision to replace Congress \u2019 s legislated policy choice with one aligning with the President \u2019 s directions. See Executive Order 14154 (ordering agencies to \u201cTerminat[e] the Green New Deal\u201d by stopping the \u201cdisbursement of funds\u201d); J.A 507 (Defendants opposition to motion for preliminary injunction describing contract terminations as \u201creflect[ing] no more than a decision based on reasons of policy\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115-16 (finding that EPA \u201cseeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter\u201d). To the extent National Institutes of Health applies here, it supports the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the policy-based interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. See National Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2 (Barrett, J., concurring) (asserting that a district court likely has jurisdiction over challenges to an agency \u2019 s policies).Binding precedent of this court anchors the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction. Our \u201clongstanding test for determining whether a claim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Claims Court pursuant to the Tucker Act\u201d confirms that the Tucker Act does not displace the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim. Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106. We explained in Megapulse that, in order to preserve the Court of Claims \u2019 exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cactions based on government contracts,\u201d a plaintiff whose \u201cclaims against the United States are essentially contractual\u201d cannot be allowed to \u201cavoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 82 of 9253the Tucker Act by casting its pleadings in terms that would enable a district court to exercise jurisdiction under a separate statute. \u201d 672 F.2d at 967. Whether a \u201cparticular action\u201d is \u201c\u2018at its essence \u2019 a contract action depends both on [1] the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon [2] the type of relief sought (or appropriate). \u201d Id. at 968. That is a flexible, context-specific inquiry that directs us to \u201cdetermine if the claim so clearly presents a disguised contract action that jurisdiction over the matter is properly limited to the Court of Claims. \u201d Id.Starting with the first prong, to determine whether the \u201csource of the rights\u201d of a claim is contractual, we consider whether the plaintiff \u2019 s arguments turn on the terms of the contract. In Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, for instance, we concluded that the plaintiff \u2019 s claims were not \u201ca disguised contract action\u201d because the plaintiff did not \u201cseek to enforce any duty imposed upon [the government] by the [relevant contract],\u201d nor did it \u201ccontend [the government] breached the terms\u201d of the contract or \u201cinvoke\u201d the contract in any other meaningful way. 864 F.3d 591, 619 (D.C Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in Megapulse, we were \u201cconvinced\u201d that the plaintiff \u2019 s claims were not \u201cdisguised\u201d contract claims by the fact that the plaintiff did not \u201cclaim a breach of contract\u201d and based its \u201crequest for relief\u201d on non-contractual documents. 672 F.2d at 969.Plaintiffs \u2019 APA challenge to Defendants \u2019 arbitrary and capricious action is clearly not a \u201cdisguised contract action. \u201d Their claim is not premised on EPA \u2019 s violation of the grant agreements \u2019 termination provisions, nor on its failure to perform any duty \u201cimposed\u201d on EPA by the grant award. Rather, Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to relief because EPA froze and seeks to seize their funds based on pretextual, internally inconsistent, and unfounded reasons. See, e.g , USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 83 of 9254Plaintiffs \u2019 Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (PI Mot.) 29 (J.A 327) (arguing that \u201cthe record leading up to the termination\u201d\u2014for example, the fact that EPA purported to terminate the grants several days after professing a \u201clack of critical information\u201d about \u201cconcerns regarding potential fraud\u201d that would be informed by an ongoing compliance review\u2014\u201chighlights the pretextual nature of EPA \u2019 s stated invocation of waste, fraud, and abuse\u201d). According to Plaintiffs, and as supported by the record, EPA acted entirely outside the bounds of acceptable agency action by first deciding to seize the money Plaintiffs had been awarded and then casting about for after-the-fact justifications\u2014including pressuring Citibank into freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 funds without any basis, notice, or explanation, and directing DOJ and FBI to open criminal investigations into Plaintiffs \u2019 grant performance without probable cause, or any grounds whatsoever. See PI Mot. 1-4 (J.A 299-302).That is precisely the type of arbitrary and capricious action the APA is designed to address. As the Supreme Court explained in Department of Commerce v. New York, agency action is arbitrary and capricious when the agency \u2019 s \u201cstated rationale was pretextual,\u201d because \u201ccontrived reasons . . . defeat the purpose of\u201d the \u201creasoned explanation requirement of administrative law. \u201d 588 U.S at 773-74, 785. The non-contractual \u201cessence\u201d of Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim has been clear since Plaintiffs filed their complaint and sought a preliminary injunction. They have from the outset sought to show that EPA \u2019 s vague, unsupported, and irrational justifications are merely \u201cpretextual cover to shut down a program approved by Congress that the new Administration does not like. \u201d PI Mot. 29 (J.A 327). That was clear to the district court from the very first hearing. See Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 9:17-18 (J.A 182) (district court observing that the terminations have \u201ca ready, fire, aim\u201d feel). Plaintiffs seek relief based on a quintessential claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action. The APA, andUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 84 of 9255not the contractual terms of the grants EPA awarded them, is the \u201csource of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.As for the second prong of the Megapulse analysis\u2014the \u201ctype of relief sought\u201d\u2014we have described the \u201ccrux of this inquiry\u201d as \u201cboil[ing] down to whether the plaintiff effectively seeks to attain . . . monetary relief from the federal government. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107. As explained above, Plaintiffs do not seek money from the Treasury; they seek only to get the government \u2019 s hands off their money. To the extent the injunction preventing the government from interfering with or seizing their funds \u201crequire[s] the same governmental restraint that specific []performance might require in a contract setting,\u201d that is an \u201cinsufficient basis to deny a district court the jurisdiction otherwise available and the remedial powers otherwise appropriate. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 971.Both prongs of the Megapulse analysis thus point to the same conclusion: Plaintiffs \u2019 claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action is not a \u201cdisguised\u201d contract action that must be heard by the Court of Claims. That conclusion comports with our longstanding recognition that the Tucker Act was a response to \u201ccongressional intent to provide a single, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. The \u201cunique expertise of the Court of Claims\u201d lies in its \u201cknowledge of the government contracting process,\u201d id.; it is a \u201cspecialized forum\u201d for awarding \u201cdamages for the Government \u2019 s past acts,\u201d Bowen, 487 U.S at 905 n.42, 908 (internal quotation marks omitted).It is far outside the specialized expertise of the Court of Claims to resolve these Plaintiffs \u2019 request for injunctive relief halting EPA \u2019 s naked pursuit of its preferred policy outcome in disregard for the evidence before it and its statutory mandate. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 85 of 9256Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that EPA violated the APA \u2019 s ban on arbitrary and capricious agency action\u2014a claim for which they seek injunctive relief, not payment from the Treasury\u2014is well within the district court \u2019 s remit.That Plaintiffs would have no right to the money to begin with but for the grant awards, which are government contracts, does not alter that conclusion. We have squarely held that the fact that a plaintiff \u201cwould have no claims to assert\u201d absent a government contract does not mean that the plaintiff asserts a \u201ccontract right. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110 (explaining that imposing such a \u201c\u2018but-for \u2019 test for identifying the source of the right . . . contravenes Megapulse \u2019 s express rejection of the argument that the mere existence of such contract-related issues converts the action to one based on the contract\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 610 (D.C Cir. 1992) (\u201c[L]itigants may bring statutory and constitutional claims in federal district court even when the claims depend on the existence and terms of a contract with the government. \u201d), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Perry Capital, 864 F.3d at 620.At bottom, the government suggests that Plaintiffs \u2019 real complaint is that EPA terminated their grant awards\u2014not that it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in doing so\u2014making its claim \u201cin essence\u201d a contract claim. It is obviously true that Plaintiffs are injured by the terminations. But it does not follow that Plaintiffs therefore assert contractual claims. When EPA began its campaign to undo the GGRF, it had already performed on the contracts by disbursing the funds, which by then belonged to Plaintiffs. The fact that those funds may only be used in accordance with grant terms does not mean Plaintiffs \u2019 only legal right to protect them arises from contract. As explained above, Plaintiffs \u2019 theory of relief is that EPA USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 86 of 9257carried out the funding freeze and purported terminations to replace Congress \u2019 s policy choice with its own preferred approach, without regard for whether its actions were supported by evidence or reason. That is a classic claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the APA. That is what makes the APA, and not their grant awards, the \u201csource of the rights upon which the plaintiff[s] base[] [their] claims. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.Because Plaintiffs bring legitimate APA and constitutional claims over which the district court has jurisdiction, I would not reach their ultra vires theory. But to the extent the majority concludes that Plaintiffs \u2019 ultra vires claim fails because Plaintiffs \u201cessentially\u201d allege only a breach of contract, the majority errs. Maj. Op. 21-22. For all the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs \u2019 claims are not \u201cessentially\u201d contractual.Citing Ingersoll-Rand, the majority posits that Plaintiffs \u2019 allegations of pretextual agency action are contract claims because \u201cthat challenge turns, in substance, on principles of federal contract law\u201d\u2014that is, Plaintiffs \u2019 pretext argument could be rephrased as a claim that EPA \u201cdishonor[ed], with impunity, its contractual obligations. \u201d Maj. Op. 17. But Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim is not \u201cessentially\u201d contractual just because EPA \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious action included grant terminations. The majority appears to read Ingersoll-Rand as establishing a rule that any claim that could be reconceptualized as a contractual violation that overlaps even in part with the claim Plaintiffs actually bring is necessarily a disguised contract claim. See Maj. Op. 16. Ingersoll-Rand announces no such rule, and any effort to interpret it to do squarely conflicts with our binding precedent.In Ingersoll-Rand, the government terminated its contract with the plaintiff \u201cfor convenience,\u201d as allowed under the terms USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 87 of 9258of the contract. Id. at 75. The plaintiff sued, alleging that the termination violated several regulations constraining the government \u2019 s ability to cancel and administer federal acquisition contracts, and that those regulatory violations meant that the termination was arbitrary and capricious. Id. at 77. We held that the \u201cessential rights at stake\u201d were contractual because the regulations themselves\u2014the violation of which was allegedly arbitrary and capricious\u2014concerned the conditions under which the government could terminate the contract. Id. at 77-78. In effect, the plaintiff had relied on regulations circumscribing the government \u2019 s behavior during the solicitation and performance of contracts to challenge the validity of the contract \u2019 s termination-for-convenience provision. The plaintiff \u2019 s claim thus \u201ccall[ed] for knowledge of the government contracting process\u201d and fell \u201cwithin the unique expertise of the Court of Claims. \u201d Id. at 78. In that context, in which the plaintiff \u2019 s claim centered on the intricacies of the government \u2019 s contracting process and the interaction between contracting regulations and the terms of the plaintiff \u2019 s contract, it made sense to hold that the plaintiff \u2019 s ability to \u201cchallenge the termination based solely on contract principles\u201d supported our determination that its claim \u201csound[ed] genuinely in contract. \u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).Ingersoll-Rand thus establishes that claims that invoke regulations governing federal contracting to challenge government action taken pursuant to a contract are \u201cin essence\u201d contractual and belong in the Court of Claims, where that court \u2019 s expertise in government contracting is particularly relevant. And it supports the majority \u2019 s conclusion that claims based on violations of regulations governing termination procedures are \u201cin essence\u201d contract claims, which is likely correct. See Maj. Op. 11-13. But that does not describe Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim. Ingersoll-RandUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 88 of 9259decidedly does not stand for a general rule that any claim that could have been framed as a breach of \u201cprinciples of federal contract law\u201d must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims\u201d Maj. Op. 17\u2014a rule that could not be squared with our other relevant decisions.That is illustrated most clearly by Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521 (D.C Cir. 1986), a decision authored by then-Judge Scalia and decided the year after Ingersoll-Rand. The plaintiff in Sharp challenged a Department of Defense policy removing him from the Ready Reserve where he served pursuant to a contract\u2014the Ready Reserve Service Agreement. 798 F.2d at 1521-23. The plaintiff alleged that the policy breached his contract and violated a statute governing the Ready Reserve, and that the contract gave him a \u201cvested property interest\u201d in serving in the reserves that the government \u201csought to deny without due process. \u201d Id. at 1523. The plaintiff \u2019 s requested relief included a declaration that the policy was \u201ccontrary to statute or in the alternative that it effects a material breach of the Ready Reserve Service Agreement,\u201d as well as a declaration that the government \u2019 s \u201cfailure to honor the terms of that contract deprived [the plaintiff] of due process. \u201d Id. We held that, while the Tucker Act barred the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s breach of contract claim, it did not displace the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s claims that the policy was \u201ccontrary to regulations, statutes and the Constitution. \u201d Id.; accord Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610. That is, the plaintiff \u2019 s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims that he had been unlawfully deprived of his contractual right to serve in the Ready Reserve were not \u201cin essence\u201d contractual even though his right to serve in the first place depended on contract, and he expressly brought one claim as a pure breach of contract. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 89 of 9260The majority \u2019 s view of Ingersoll-Rand cannot be reconciled with Sharp. Allen Sharp \u2019 s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims not only could be based on contract principles, but in fact were also framed that way. If the majority \u2019 s rule were right, the district court could not have exercised jurisdiction over his due process claim. The same analysis is confirmed in Megapulse itself. There, the plaintiff alleged that the government \u2019 s plan to distribute his data violated the Trade Secrets Act and deprived him of his property without due process. 672 F.2d at 962-63. That claim, too, could have been based solely on contract principles, as the government had made a contractual promise not to disseminate the plaintiff \u2019 s \u201climited rights\u201d data. Id. at 962. But that counterfactual did not preclude us from holding\u2014nor even factor into our conclusion\u2014that the district court had jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s claim. See id. at 966-71.Indeed, in Megapulse, we expressly rejected the idea that the Tucker Act means that \u201can agency action may not be enjoined, even if in clear violation of a specific statute, simply because that same action might also amount to a breach of contract. \u201d Id. at 971. Rather, district courts have jurisdiction over and can enjoin agency action that violates the APA, even if that action also \u201camounts to\u201d a breach of contract. Id. That is the situation here: Plaintiffs claim that EPA \u2019 s termination was arbitrary and capricious because it relied on pretextual and unsupported justifications, not because it violated the grant award \u2019 s termination provision. The fact that the government \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious decision making could be reframed as a claim that \u201cEPA acted with \u2018impunity \u2019 when terminating the grants\u201d does not transform the claim into a contract action.In relegating to the Court of Claims any statutory, regulatory, or constitutional claim merely because it arguably could to some extent be reframed as a contract action, the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 90 of 9261majority \u2019 s rule precludes district court jurisdiction and injunctive relief for a wide swath of claims that\u2014like Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that EPA \u2019 s actions to freeze their accounts and terminate their grants were arbitrary and capricious\u2014are simply not contract claims. Such a rule effects an unprecedented expansion of the Tucker Act that is divorced from the \u201ccongressional intent to provide a single, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes,\u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78, and it strips district courts of jurisdiction over all manner of claims over which they have the relevant expertise. It also threatens to \u201cpreclude any review at all of constitutional claims seeking equitable relief, where the constitutional claims stem from contracts,\u201d thereby raising \u201cserious constitutional question[s]. \u201d Transohio, 967 F.2d at 611 (internal quotation marks omitted). And it flies in the face of our cases \u2019 longstanding refrain that \u201cthe mere fact that a court may have to rule on a contract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, automatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the court of jurisdiction it might otherwise have. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968). Such a rule is unsupported by our precedent, prevents the court from making \u201crational distinctions between actions sounding genuinely in contract and those based on truly independent legal grounds,\u201d and runs directly counter to our acknowledgement that, \u201c[a]lthough it is important on the one hand to preserve the Tucker Act \u2019 s limited and conditioned waiver of sovereign immunity in contract actions, we must not do so in terms so broad as to deny a [district] court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than a contractual relationship with the government. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968-70.As applied in this case, the majority \u2019 s conclusion that Plaintiffs \u2019 claims are merely contract claims ignores what the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 91 of 9262agency did and describes a claim that Plaintiffs did not bring. This case is not an attempt to reframe EPA \u2019 s termination or violation of some grant awards as unlawful agency action. Indeed, throughout this litigation, there has hardly been any dispute that the government did breach the terms of the grant awards. That is not what this case is about. Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s asserted power to take baseless and unjustifiable actions to pursue its desired ends\u2014here, the termination of the grant awards\u2014regardless of the means it must employ to get there. It is beyond dispute that questions of such significance to the way our government operates are not relegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.CONCLUSIONEmbracing a misguided and breathtakingly expansive conception of the Tucker Act, the majority allows the government to seize Plaintiffs \u2019 money based on spurious and pretextual allegations and to permanently gut implementation of major congressional legislation designed to improve the infrastructure, health, and economic security of communities throughout the country. The injunction the district court put in place is eminently supported by Plaintiffs \u2019 likelihood of success on both their APA and constitutional claims, the irreparable harm that will befall them, and the unlawful nullification of Congress \u2019 s duly enacted policy\u2014all of which inure to the detriment of the American people.

Citing concerns about conflicts of interest and lack of oversight, EPA terminated the grants in March 2025. The grantees sued, and the district court entered a preliminary injunction ordering EPA and Citibank to continue funding the grants.We conclude the district court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction. The grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractual, and therefore jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. And while the district court had jurisdiction over the grantees \u2019 constitutional claim, that claim is meritless. Moreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which on behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and management of this multi-billion-dollar fund. Accordingly, we vacate the injunction. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 3 of 924I.This case involves EPA grants awarded under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, for which Congress appropriated $27 billion. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-169, \u00a7 60103, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065 \u2013 67 (formerly codified at 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 (2024)). In August 2024, EPA awarded $20 billion to eight nonprofits pursuant to two of the grant programs it created: the National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. Five of those grantees are plaintiffs in this case: Climate United Fund ($6.97 billion), Coalition for Green Capital ($5 billion), Power Forward Communities, Inc. ($2 billion), Inclusiv, Inc. ($1.87 billion), and Justice Climate Fund, Inc. ($940 million).Each grant was memorialized in an agreement between the nonprofit and EPA. The grant agreements have an unusual structure. Typically, grant funds are held by the U.S Treasury and disbursed incrementally as grantees use the funds for program purposes. EPA structured these grants with a middleman that would hold the funds as a \u201cfinancial agent\u201d of the United States. According to EPA, this was the first time the federal government used a financial agent, as opposed to Treasury, to carry out this kind of grant program. Treasury entered a Financial Agency Agreement (\u201cFAA\u201d) with Citibank. As set forth in the grant agreements, the funds were to be transferred from Treasury to Citibank in a \u201ctwo-step transaction\u201d involving a \u201cdrawdown\u201d by the grantee and a subsequent \u201cdisbursement\u201d to the appropriate Citibank account. J.A 566. The disbursement by the grantee is deemed \u201can allowable cost\u201d under \u201cthe EPA award. \u201d Id.Although the funds are held at Citibank, the grantees \u2019 use of the funds remains highly restricted. The money may be used only \u201cfor the purposes and under the conditions of the [grant USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 4 of 925agreement],\u201d and \u201cmust be maintained\u201d at Citibank until the end of the grant \u2019 s period of performance. J.A 568. The grantees \u2019 use of the funds is further restricted by Account Control Agreements (\u201cACAs\u201d) between EPA, Citibank, and each of the grantees. The ACAs give the government a \u201cright to exclusive control\u201d over the Citibank accounts. J.A 72. If the government exercises that right, Citibank must follow the government \u2019 s transfer instructions \u201cwithout further consent by the [grantee]. \u201d Id. The ACAs expressly acknowledge that Citibank \u201cact[s] as a financial agent of the United States pursuant to the authority of the U.S Department of the Treasury. \u201d J.A 71.The sheer scale of the grant program and the method of allocating billions of dollars drew public attention and criticism. The record includes a widely publicized video in which an EPA employee was recorded describing how \u201cuntil recently\u201d his role was to make sure proper \u201cprocesses are in place to \u2026 prevent fraud and to prevent abuse,\u201d but after the election of President Donald Trump, EPA was \u201cjust trying to get the money out as fast as possible before they come in and \u2026 stop it all. \u201d J.A 705 n.1 The employee compared the situation to \u201cthrowing gold bars off the Titanic. \u201dThe month before President Trump \u2019 s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements\u2014with no apparent consideration from the grantees\u2014to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.1 The week before the1 In December 2024, the government unilaterally modified the grant agreements, including by (1) eliminating any reference to termination for agency priorities; (2) requiring \u201ccredible evidence \u2026 of a violation of Federal criminal law\u201d before the government could exercise its contractual right to terminate for waste, fraud, or abuse; and (3) giving the grantees an expanded right USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 5 of 926inauguration, EPA amended the ACAs to require Citibank to \u201ccontinue to disburse funds\u201d to the grantees, even if the government exercised its right of exclusive control, if the funds are \u201cassociated with financial obligations \u2018properly incurred \u2019 \u201d before the government exercised its right. J.A 658.After the change in administration, EPA reviewed the grants and raised concerns about conflicts of interest during the award process, the political connections of the chosen grantees, lack of government oversight and control over tens of billions of dollars, and last-minute amendments to the grant agreements and ACAs.2 In February 2025, the FBI recommended to Citibank that it \u201cplace an administrative freeze on the account(s) associated with\u201d the grantees \u2019 ACAs. As the government \u2019 s financial agent, Citibank complied and stopped disbursing funds to the grantees. EPA also referred the matter to the Office of Inspector General for investigation. Shortly thereafter, EPA terminated the grant agreements.The grantees sued, seeking to enjoin the terminations as unconstitutional, unlawful, and arbitrary and capricious. They sought a preliminary injunction barring EPA from terminating the grants \u201cexcept as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant award, and applicable law,\u201d and ordering Citibank toto cure any nonperformance. There is no serious dispute that these modifications increased the likelihood that a termination by the incoming administration would constitute a breach of contract.2 For example, the Acting Deputy Administrator averred in a letter to the EPAInspector General that \u201cthe former director of the [Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund], personally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital \u2013 without recusing himself. \u201d J.A 670. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 6 of 927resume disbursements \u201cin accordance with the ACA. \u201d J.A 171 \u2013 72.The district court entered the injunction. It first held that it had jurisdiction because the grantees \u2019 claims were not essentially contractual and therefore did not need to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A , 778 F. Supp. 3d 90, 107 \u2013 11 (D.D.C 2025). On the merits, the court concluded the grantees were likely to succeed on their constitutional, regulatory, and arbitrary and capricious claims. The district court found the balance of harms supported an injunction because the nonprofits exist \u201cto fulfill the objectives of a grant\u201d and \u201csufficient protections [are] in place\u201d to prevent \u201creckless spending. \u201d Id. at 117, 120. The district court further concluded that an injunction \u201chalt[ing] any unlawful action\u201d serves the public interest. Id. at 121. The court enjoined Citibank as well, requiring it to disburse funds according to the relevant agreements.We administratively stayed the injunction and ordered the parties to take no action \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d with respect to the disputed funds, thereby prohibiting the grantees from making further commitments in reliance on the disputed funds. We then accelerated consideration of the merits of the appeal.II.While this litigation was pending, Congress enacted legislation repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. See Pub. L. No. 119-21, \u00a7 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 154 (2025) (repealing 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 and rescinding \u201cunobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section\u201d). Our partial administrative stay did not lift the portion of the district court \u2019 s order enjoining the grant terminations, so the funds at issue in this case remain at Citibank and remainUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 7 of 928obligated. Congress \u2019 s repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund therefore did not render this appeal moot.We review the district court \u2019 s preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, its underlying legal conclusions de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 726 (D.C Cir. 2022). We consider the same Winter factors the district court applied, which require a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction to establish that it \u201cis likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. \u201d Id. at 727 (quoting Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S 7, 20 (2008)).III.The district court erred in concluding the grantees are likely to succeed on their regulatory, arbitrary and capricious, and constitutional claims. See Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C Cir. 2014) (describing likelihood of success on the merits as the \u201cmost important factor\u201d when considering a preliminary injunction). The grantees \u2019 regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims can be heard only in the Court of Federal Claims, and their constitutional claim is meritless.A.The grantees first allege the termination of their grants violated Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) regulations and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). As a remedy, they sought and received an injunction barring the termination of their grants and restoring access to the funds held by Citibank. We conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction over these USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 8 of 929claims, which are essentially contractual and therefore must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.31.The federal government enjoys sovereign immunity and may be subject to suit only when it has explicitly waived that immunity. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S 392, 399 (1976). Waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed to protect the prerogatives of the government and to ensure the courts stay within the jurisdiction provided by Congress. See Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S 187, 192 (1996); Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S 682, 703 \u2013 05 (1949). The grantees brought their claims in district court, invoking the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity, which applies to claims \u201cseeking relief other than money damages. \u201d 5 U.S.C \u00a7 702. But this waiver applies only if no \u201cother statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought. \u201d Id. For contract claims against the government, the Tucker Act establishes review in the Court of Federal Claims, which may award only damages and cannot provide3 Although the dissent considers this threshold jurisdictional question a \u201cdiver[sion],\u201d Dissenting Op. 47, our authority to assess the lawfulness of EPA \u2019 s actions of course depends on having jurisdiction. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env \u2019 t, 523 U.S 83, 94 (1998). Concluding that jurisdiction over most of these claims lies with the Court of Federal Claims, we do not reach their merits. The dissent inverts this fundamental limitation on Article III courts by recounting at great length the integrity and virtue of the previous administration \u2019 s efforts to implement the Inflation Reduction Act and the alleged misdeeds of the current administration in terminating the grants. Our jurisdiction, however, rests on law, not on the severity of the alleged wrongdoing claimed by the grantees and reported by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Politico. See Dissenting Op. 11, 12, 14, 36. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 9 of 9210declaratory or injunctive relief except in narrow circumstances. See 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1491; Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 963 n.13 (D.C Cir. 1982); Walters v. Sec \u2019 y of Defense, 725 F.2d 107, 112 n.10 (D.C Cir. 1983).When it applies, Tucker Act jurisdiction is exclusive and precludes jurisdiction in district court under the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity.4 See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C Cir. 1992). The Court of Federal Claims is the \u201csingle, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C Cir. 1985). Because Congress has limited the forum and the remedies for contract claims against the government, a litigant whose claim is essentially contractual cannot \u201cavoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of the Tucker Act\u201d by simply asking for injunctive relief in district court. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967; Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613 (\u201c[T]he APA does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief. \u201d).This jurisdictional inquiry cannot turn on a plaintiff \u2019 s preferred characterization of its claim, lest we \u201cupset the carefully modulated waiver of sovereign immunity and grant of remedies for breach of contract embodied in the Tucker Act. \u201d Int \u2019 l Eng \u2019 g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 573, 580 (D.C Cir. 1975); see also McKay v. United States,4 The Tucker Act contains one exception to this rule, not relevant in this suit involving billions of dollars. Damages claims not exceeding $10,000 may be brought in district court, although the Tucker Act \u2019 s remedial restrictions still apply. See 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1346(a)(2); Int \u2019 l Eng \u2019 g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 573, 577 n.4 (D.C Cir. 1975); see also Contract Disputes Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-563, \u00a7\u00a7 3(a), 10(a), 14(a), 92 Stat. 2383, 2383 \u2013 84, 2388 \u2013 89 (limiting exception to non-procurement claims). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 10 of 9211516 F.3d 848, 851 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[I]n the contract context, a distinct line of authority preserves the sovereign \u2019 s immunity from being compelled to perform obligations it prefers to breach and compensate financially, holding that what are \u2018in essence \u2019 claims for breach of contract cannot circumvent the Tucker Act and its prohibition on equitable relief by being artfully pled as something else. \u201d).To determine whether jurisdiction was proper in the district court, we must therefore assess whether the grantees \u2019 claims are essentially contractual. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 \u2013 68. The fact that the grantees \u2019 \u201ccomplaint nowhere mentions breach of contract \u2026 cannot alone suffice to establish jurisdiction in the District Court. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77. Instead, for each claim we consider (1) whether \u201cthe source of the rights\u201d asserted is contractual or is \u201cbased on truly independent legal grounds\u201d and (2) whether \u201cthe type of relief sought\u201d is a typical contract remedy. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968 \u2013 71; see Transohio, 967 F.2d at 609.2.The grantees first allege EPA \u2019 s termination of their agreements violated OMB regulations. By terminating for \u201cagency priorities,\u201d EPA allegedly relied on a basis for termination not set forth in the grant agreements, in violation of 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4). Furthermore, EPA allegedly failed to provide written notice of termination as required by 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.341(a). Despite the grantees \u2019 characterization, their claims are essentially contractual and therefore the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear them.First, the source of the grantees \u2019 right to the relief they seek is their agreements, which are contracts for Tucker Act purposes. See Dep \u2019 t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025) (per curiam); Columbus Reg \u2019 l Hosp. v. United States,USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 11 of 9212990 F.3d 1330, 1338 \u2013 41 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 145 S. Ct. 2219, 2231 (2025) (explaining that courts have historically described federal grants as contracts). Each grantee \u2019 s right to the funds arises \u201conly upon creation and satisfaction of its contract with the government; in no sense d[oes] it exist independently of that contract. \u201d Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C Cir. 1985). While the grantees attempt to ground their claims in OMB guidance, the substance of these claims may be understood \u201cas entirely contained within the terms of the contract\u201d or in principles of contract law. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78.The claim that EPA violated 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4) expressly refers to and incorporates the grant agreements. The grantees interpret this OMB guidance as prohibiting the government from terminating based on agency priorities unless the grant agreements reserve the right to terminate on those grounds. Even assuming this is what the guidance requires, the grantees \u2019 claim turns on the government \u2019 s rights under the agreements\u2014a question of contract interpretation that the parties fiercely dispute. Because this claim perforce incorporates the grant agreements, it is not based \u201csolely\u201d on the regulation or on \u201ctruly independent legal grounds. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78; Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969 \u2013 70.The claim that EPA failed to give proper notice of termination in violation of 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.341(a) is not an independent legal ground for a slightly different reason. This allegation \u201ccould be phrased\u201d as a claim that the government stopped performing on the contract without sufficient warning. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. Federal contract law addresses USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 12 of 9213when defective notice by the government is actionable,5 and therefore the substance of the grantees \u2019 claim can be analyzed \u201csolely on contract principles. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. As we have explained, the fact that the government \u2019 s termination of a contract \u201calso arguably violates certain other regulations does not transform the action into one based solely on those regulations. \u201d Id. Indeed, \u201c[i]f the mere allegation\u201d of violations of the regulations governing federal contracting and grantmaking \u201cwere to bring claims of this type within the jurisdiction of the district court, Congress \u2019 intent to limit contract remedies against the government to damages in the [Court of Federal Claims] would be effectively circumvented. \u201d Id. (cleaned up). Because the substance of the grantees \u2019 notice claim sounds in federal contract law, the claim is essentially contractual and can be heard only in the Court of Federal Claims. The grantees cannot avoid the Tucker Act \u2019 s jurisdictional channeling by disguising a breach of contract claim as a claim that the government violated the regulations governing grantmaking.Furthermore, the guidance documents on which the grantees rely likely do not create enforceable private rights because they merely set out principles for agencies to follow when making grants. See Guidance for Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089 \u2013 90 (Apr. 22, 2024). These guidance provisions fall within subtitle A of Title 2, which sets forth OMB \u2019 s \u201cguidance to Federal agencies on5 See, e.g , Decker &amp; Co. v. West, 76 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201c[H]arm should accompany a defect in an otherwise proper termination notice in order for the contractor to seek relief based on that defect. \u201d); Philadelphia Regent Builders v. United States, 634 F.2d 569, 572 \u2013 73 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (declining to treat government \u2019 s termination as defective because government \u2019 s regulatory violations were \u201charmless technical defects\u201d). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 13 of 9214government-wide policies for the award and administration of Federal financial assistance. \u201d 2 C.F.R \u00a7 1.100(a). \u201cPublication of the OMB guidance in the [Code of Federal Regulations] does not change its nature\u2014it is guidance, not regulation. \u201d Id. \u00a7 1.105(b). But in any event, as the dissent concedes, Dissenting Op. 58, these regulatory claims are essentially contractual, and we have no jurisdiction to consider them.Second, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction because the remedy the grantees seek is contractual in nature. The grantees requested an injunction barring EPA from terminating the grants, \u201cexcept as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant award, and applicable law,\u201d and ordering Citibank to resume disbursements \u201cin accordance with the ACA. \u201d The grantees maintain they own the funds and seek an injunction barring unlawful interference, rather than an order for specific performance. But the grantees \u2019 \u201cownership\u201d of the funds goes only as far as the grant agreements and the ACAs permit. And the funds are held by Citibank, which acts as a fiduciary of the government. Despite their characterization, in substance, the grantees are seeking specific performance of their agreements with the government.6 As then-Judge Scalia6 The dissent \u2019 s only legal argument that we have jurisdiction turns on the claim that the grantees have \u201ctitle\u201d to the billions of dollars in government funding. To demonstrate the grantees \u2019 ownership, however, the dissent relies on the grant agreements and the ACAs\u2014that is, on the disputed and ongoing contracts that govern the parties \u2019 relationship. Dissenting Op. 48. The dissent \u2019 s argument merely reinforces that this dispute is contractual and belongs in the Court of Federal Claims. And even assuming the grantees had somehow secured title, that would simply mean the grantees might have a Takings Clause claim for damages, a claim they have not made and which in any event would also have to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. See Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 14 of 9215explained, \u201c[t]he waiver of sovereign immunity in the [APA] does not run to actions seeking declaratory relief or specific performance in contract cases. \u201d7 Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1523 (D.C Cir. 1986). \u201c[A] complaint involving a request for specific performance must be resolved by the [Court of Federal] Claims. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 80.In sum, the grantees cannot manufacture district court jurisdiction through artful pleading. Because the grantees \u2019 regulatory claims are essentially contractual, they must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.3.Nor can the grantees repackage their contract claims by invoking the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. The grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claims are also essentially2170, 2173 (2019) (explaining the Tucker Act \u201cprovides the standard procedure for bringing [takings] claims\u201d against the federal government and that \u201c[e]quitable relief [is] not available\u201d if \u201cmonetary relief \u2026 under the Tucker Act\u201d is).7 The dissent \u2019 s reliance on Sharp is entirely misplaced. In Sharp, there was no dispute that the plaintiff was a military officer, that he had an interest in his employment, and that the deprivation of that interest without due process could be litigated in district court under Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S 61, 71 (1974). See Sharp, 798 F.2d at 1523. Here, by contrast, the rights and interests of the grantees are disputed. The grantees assert they \u201cperformed\u201d on their contracts when Treasury deposited federal funds at Citibank, the government \u2019 s financial agent. Even overlooking the oddity of this argument, whether the grantees have performed depends entirely on the terms of the disputed contracts\u2014a question that must be adjudicated in the Court of Federal Claims. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 15 of 9216contractual, considering both the source of the legal right asserted and the remedy sought.The grantees assert the government acted arbitrarily because it \u201coffered no facts or individualized reasoning to justify\u201d the grant terminations. And the grantees insist they can challenge the sufficiency of the government \u2019 s reasons for terminating the grants separately from the issue of whether the terminations were allowed under the agreements. But this court has expressly and repeatedly rejected attempts to manufacture district court jurisdiction by framing contract claims as violations of the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. See Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77 \u2013 78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580. Despite the grantees \u2019 characterizations, the remedy they seek is specific performance of their contracts, and they have identified no right to that relief that is \u201ctruly independent\u201d of the grant agreements. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970.As already discussed in reference to the grantees \u2019 regulatory claims, the grantees seek to set aside their grant terminations, which means they seek specific performance. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 79 \u2013 80. This is a \u201ctypical contract remedy\u201d that indicates a claim is \u201cfounded upon a contract for purposes of the Tucker Act. \u201d Spectrum Leasing, 764 F.2d at 894 \u2013 95; see also Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613.The APA \u2019 s substantive bar on arbitrary and capricious action does not give the grantees an independent right to specific performance of their grant agreements. To the extent the grantees argue the government acted arbitrarily by failing to follow the terms of the grant agreements, that argument can be evaluated only by \u201creference to and incorporation of\u201d the agreements. Richardson, 512 F.2d at 578. The source of the right asserted is therefore not \u201ctruly independent\u201d of the contracts. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 16 of 9217To the extent the grantees argue the terminations were arbitrary regardless of whether they were permitted under the agreements, that challenge turns, in substance, on principles of federal contract law. That law prohibits the government from \u201cdishonor[ing], with impunity, its contractual obligations\u201d even when a contract allows the government to terminate for convenience. Maxima Corp. v. United States, 847 F.2d 1549, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (cleaned up). The grantees \u2019 argument that the termination was arbitrary and capricious is simply a claim that EPA breached the grant agreements by terminating with \u201cimpunity. \u201d That claim must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims.The grantees insist the APA gives them an independent right to be free of arbitrary agency action, including contract terminations. But we have long rejected the idea that the APA \u2019 s general bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract terminations to a parallel review scheme in district court.8 See Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77 \u2013 78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (\u201c[D]ecisions made by contracting officers pursuant to contract clauses fall outside the contemplation of the [APA]. \u201d). The APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action did not \u201cdestroy the Court of [Federal] Claims by implication. \u201d Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (cleaned up).8 The dissent \u2019 s analysis focuses on the grantees \u2019 \u201ctheory of relief\u201d and concludes that because the grantees have \u201clegitimate\u201d APA claims and request injunctive relief, the district court has jurisdiction. Dissenting Op. 56 \u2013 57. But Supreme Court and circuit precedent require that we look beyond plaintiffs \u2019 characterization of their claims and determine whether the claims are \u201cbased on truly independent legal grounds,\u201d not simply whether plaintiffs have made good faith legal arguments. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969 \u2013 70. On this central question, the dissent has nothing to offer. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 17 of 9218In sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims that the federal government terminated a grant agreement arbitrarily or with impunity. Claims of arbitrary grant termination are essentially contractual and fall outside the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity.This conclusion is reinforced by the Supreme Court \u2019 s recent decision in a stay posture that a very similar arbitrary and capricious challenge to federal grant terminations likely could not be brought in district court. See Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968. In that case, state plaintiffs sued in district court and claimed the Department of Education \u2019 s decision to terminate several grants was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The district court enjoined the terminations. The Court stayed the injunction on the ground that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction over the APA claims because \u201cthe Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on \u2018any express or implied contract with the United States. \u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1491(a)(1)). The Supreme Court has doubled down on this conclusion in another case staying an injunction against discretionary grant terminations: \u201cThe [APA] \u2019 s \u2018limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity \u2019 does not provide the District Court with jurisdiction to adjudicate claims \u2018based on \u2019 \u201d the plaintiffs \u2019 grants \u201cor to order relief designed to enforce any \u2018obligation to pay money \u2019 pursuant to those grants. \u201d Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health v. Am. Pub. Health Ass \u2019 n, No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Aug. 21, 2025) (quoting Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968).The Court \u2019 s reasoning requires respect and strongly supports our conclusion that the grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious challenge to the grant terminations is a disguised contract claim that cannot be heard in district court. See Trump v. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025) (\u201cAlthough our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 18 of 9219court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases. \u201d); Priests for Life v. HHS, 808 F.3d 1, 25 (D.C Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that Supreme Court stay orders are \u201cextremely strong signals\u201d); see generally Trevor N. McFadden &amp; Vetan Kapoor, The Precedential Effects of The Supreme Court \u2019 s Emergency Stays, 44 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol \u2019 y 827, 831 (2021) (arguing some emergency orders are \u201cauthoritative with respect to future cases considering the same legal questions\u201d).In the face of this overwhelming authority, the grantees nonetheless maintain that jurisdiction over their arbitrary and capricious claims is proper. But the two cases on which they rely cannot support that conclusion.The grantees point out that this court reviewed an agency \u2019 s grant termination under the APA \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious standard in Kansas City v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 923 F.2d 188, 193 (D.C Cir. 1991). But the court in that case made no mention of the Tucker Act, nor did it engage with our decisions in Richardson and Ingersoll-Rand. This drive-by jurisdictional holding does not bind us. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env \u2019 t, 523 U.S 83, 91 (1998). Just one year later, we extensively considered the jurisdictional framework and \u201cdecline[d] to overrule this Court \u2019 s very specific holdings that the APA does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief. \u201d Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613. As the Supreme Court \u2019 s stay order in Department of Education confirms, Kansas City is an outlier and does not support district court jurisdiction over the grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claims.Second, the grantees point to Maryland Department of Human Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services, which held that a state agency could maintain an USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 19 of 9220arbitrary and capricious claim in district court to challenge the federal government \u2019 s withholding of grant funds. 763 F.2d 1441, 1451, 1453 (D.C Cir. 1985). In that case, the federal government was required by law to pay block grant funds to Maryland according to a statutory formula. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1397a(a) \u2013 (b), 1397b(b) (1982). We explained that Maryland \u2019 s claim was not contractual for purposes of the Tucker Act because it \u201cturn[ed] on the interpretation of statutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement negotiated by the parties. \u201d Maryland, 763 F.2d at 1449. There was no \u201ccontract within the meaning of the Tucker Act\u201d\u2014only statutes and regulations that dictated how much Maryland was entitled to receive, how the funds could be spent, and under what circumstances the federal government could withhold payment. Id.By contrast, these grant agreements are \u201ccontracts\u201d within the meaning of the Tucker Act because they include the traditional contract elements of offer, acceptance, and consideration. See, e.g , Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968; Columbus Reg \u2019 l Hosp., 990 F.3d at 1338 \u2013 41. The grantees do not suggest that any of these elements is lacking. Moreover, the Inflation Reduction Act did not specify who was to receive money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund or in what amount. Those determinations were to be made \u201con a competitive basis\u201d at the discretion of the EPA Administrator. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (2024). The grantees obtained federal funds only because they were awarded discretionary EPA grants, the terms of which are governed by the grant agreements. See Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *4 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that Department of Education \u201ccontrols\u201d when a district court seeks to remedy \u201cthe government \u2019 s denial of previously awarded discretionary grants\u201d). The dispute over the termination of these agreements does not turn solely, or USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 20 of 9221really at all, on the statute, and the relief sought is continued performance of the agreements.In short, the grantees cannot circumvent the Court of Federal Claims by arguing that EPA \u2019 s termination of the grants was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.4.Finally, the grantees cannot bring their regulatory or arbitrary and capricious claims in district court by arguing that the EPA Administrator acted ultra vires. The grantees invoke the Larson-Dugan doctrine, which, like the Ex parte Young exception to state sovereign immunity, holds that sovereign immunity does not bar suits against federal officers whose \u201cpowers are limited by statute\u201d and whose actions go \u201cbeyond those limitations\u201d or are \u201cconstitutionally void. \u201d Larson, 337 U.S at 689, 701 \u2013 02; see also Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S 609, 621 \u2013 23 (1963). The grantees insist Administrator Zeldin exceeded his lawful authority by terminating the agreements in violation of the OMB guidance provisions and the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. We disagree.The Supreme Court in Larson recognized that the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity does not apply to contract claims: \u201cThe Government, as representative of the community as a whole, cannot be stopped in its tracks by any plaintiff who presents a disputed question of property or contract right. \u201d 337 U.S at 704. As already explained, the grantees \u2019 regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims essentially allege the government (1) violated the terms of the grant agreements and (2) acted with impunity. If proven, these claims establish breach of contract. They do not establish that the government (or any official) acted in excess of statutory limits or in contravention of the Constitution, as is required toUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 21 of 9222invoke the Larson-Dugan exception.9 See Larson, 337 U.S at 695 (squarely rejecting the contention that \u201can officer given the power to make decisions\u201d only has sovereign immunity when he \u201cmake[s] correct decisions\u201d).The grantees cannot bootstrap district court jurisdiction through the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity because their regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims are essentially contractual.B.The grantees also maintain that EPA violated the \u201cSeparation of Powers\u201d by not enforcing the Inflation Reduction Act, citing In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C Cir. 2013). The grantees contend that Congress directed how and when the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund appropriations were to be spent and that EPA violated those directives by canceling the grant agreements. Although the district court had jurisdiction over this claim, it is unlikely to succeed on the merits.As an initial matter, this is not a constitutional claim at all, but rather a claim that EPA violated the Inflation Reduction Act. Claims that agency officials acted in excess of their statutory authority do not ipso facto allege violations of the \u201cSeparation of Powers. \u201d See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S 462,9 This is consistent with the general principle that \u201c[i]t is not illegal for a party to breach a contract. \u201d United States v. Blankenship, 382 F.3d 1110, 1133 (11th Cir. 2004). \u201cThe duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it[]\u2014and nothing else. \u201d United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S 839, 919 \u2013 20 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting Holmes, The Path of the Law (1897), in 3 The Collected Works of Justice Holmes 391, 394 (S. Novick ed. 1995)). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 22 of 9223474 (1994) (distinguishing between \u201cclaims that an official exceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims that he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other\u201d); cf. 5 U.S.C \u00a7 706(2) (distinguishing judicial review of agency action \u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity\u201d and action \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations\u201d). As we recently explained, when a \u201csupposed separation-of-powers violation turns entirely on whether [executive] officials violated the governing statutes, \u2026 Dalton requires us to analyze the claim as an ultra vires one. \u201d Nat \u2019 l Treasury Emps. Union v. Vought, No. 25-5091, 2025 WL 2371608, at *19 \u2013 20 (D.C Cir. Aug. 15, 2025); see also Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097, 2025 WL 2326021, at *6 \u2013 9 (D.C Cir. Aug. 13, 2025). The grantees here allege violations of the statute, not the Constitution, and we decline to adopt a principle that would convert every statutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim.We conclude EPA did not violate the Inflation Reduction Act when it terminated these grants. The grantees have identified no statutory provision that barred the cancellation of the grants. In relevant part, the Inflation Reduction Act \u201cappropriated to the Administrator\u201d $20 billion \u201cto make grants[] on a competitive basis\u201d and provided that the funds are \u201cto remain available until September 30, 2024. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (2024). The grantees interpret these provisions as a mandate that EPA spend the full $20 billion, a mandate that EPA allegedly violated when it cancelled grants after the September 2024 appropriation deadline. But even assuming the statute required EPA to obligate all $20 billion by the appropriation deadline, EPA did so. EPA later cancelled the grants, but the Act does not limit the Administrator \u2019 s discretion to withhold or terminate grants. And EPA repeatedly represented that it planned to recommit the funds. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 23 of 9224The grantees and the dissent insist EPA \u2019 s promise to recommit the funds was hollow because the Inflation Reduction Act appropriation had lapsed by the time EPA terminated the grants, and therefore EPA had no ability to recommit the funds. But the grantees cite no authority for the proposition that when an agency cancels a grant after an appropriation has lapsed, any recommitment of those funds requires deobligation and a new appropriation by Congress. Indeed, such a categorical rule would be inconsistent with the longstanding position of the Government Accountability Office\u2014a legislative agency\u2014that the Executive Branch may issue replacement contracts even after an appropriation has lapsed. See Funding of Replacement Contracts, 68 Comp. Gen. 158, 158 (Dec. 19, 1988); see also 31 U.S.C \u00a7 1552(a) (providing that appropriation account does not close until five years after an appropriation expires).In fact, the Executive often issues replacement contracts after terminating for convenience, a practice the Comptroller General has approved for decades.10 See U.S General Accounting Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 3d ed., vol. 1, 5-28 \u2013 5-33 (Jan. 2004) (discussing history of replacement contracts and associated Comptroller General opinions). Moreover, the rule the grantees assert would be inconsistent with this court \u2019 s recognition that the government gets \u201ca second chance to obligate\u201d even after an appropriation has lapsed if a court sets aside the original, timely obligation. Population Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1071 (D.C Cir. 1986). Considering the longstanding practice of the political branches, as well as our precedent, we are not persuaded that10 The Comptroller General opinion the dissent cites is inapposite because it involves new obligations, not replacement grants. See Dissenting Op. 41. Replacement grants do not require a new obligation of funds. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 24 of 9225the government lacks authority to recommit the funds after termination.11The district court \u2019 s determination that the grantees were likely to succeed on their \u201cconstitutional\u201d Inflation Reduction Act claim rests on both factual and legal error. The court found that \u201cEPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115. This factual determination was not supported by any evidence in the record and rested only on the district court \u2019 s assertion that EPA \u201csuspended all eight grants. \u201d Id. at 116. But the suspension of the grants standing alone cannot demonstrate EPA was shutting down the statutory programs without congressional approval. Indeed, EPA repeatedly stated that it planned to recommit the grant money with greater oversight and accountability, contradicting the district court \u2019 s shutdown finding. Absent any clear evidence to the contrary, EPA \u2019 s representations were entitled to a presumption of regularity. See Am. Fed \u2019 n of Gov \u2019 t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Reagan, 870 F.2d 723, 727 (D.C Cir. 1989).Rather than credit EPA \u2019 s statements or explain why the presumption of regularity was overcome, the district court simply declared EPA was shutting down the programs. The court disregarded the government \u2019 s interest in prudent management of the grant programs and the government \u2019 s representations that it planned to properly supervise, rather11 We need not consider for purposes of this appeal whether the recent repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and the recission of \u201cunobligated balances,\u201d affects EPA \u2019 s ability to recommit the funds at issue here. If the repeal of the statute bars EPA from recommitting the funds, it stands to reason that the repeal also relieves EPA of any statutory obligation to do so. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 25 of 9226than abandon, the grantmaking process.12 The district court \u2019 s conclusory factual finding of program dismantlement was clearly erroneous. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 118 (D.C Cir. 2001) (explaining that even on clear error review the court is not required to \u201caccept findings that are utterly deficient\u201d).Because EPA issued the grants in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act, and there is no evidence the agency sought to dismantle the programs without congressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees \u2019 claims. In that case we issued a writ of mandamus because for years the Nuclear Regulatory Commission flagrantly disregarded statutory commands, failed to spend appropriated funds, and plainly stated it had no intention of complying with its statutory obligations. In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 257 \u2013 59. By contrast, EPA entered the grant agreements before the appropriation expired in September 2024, in compliance with any requirement in the Inflation Reduction Act to spend funds. EPA subsequently terminated the agreements because of its concerns about lack of oversight and potential conflicts of interest during the award process.EPA \u2019 s actions here are well within the Executive Branch \u2019 s authority and responsibility to manage the expenditure of funds and to ensure that money appropriated by Congress is properly spent for its intended purposes. The grant terminations may be12 The district court also ignored the government \u2019 s evidence of mismanagement of the grant funds, such as the damning \u201cgold bars\u201d video, which further supports EPA \u2019 s good faith in deciding to terminate the grants and recommit the funds with proper supervision and accountability. See J.A 107 n.1 Moreover, the dissent focuses primarily on EPA \u2019 s actions against these grantees, but the repeated recounting of these actions tells us little about whether EPA will recommit the funds through a more robust process. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 26 of 9227challenged on the merits as a breach of contract, but nothing in the Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care that the grant programs be faithfully executed.The grantees \u2019 false invocation of the separation of powers cannot justify this preliminary injunction, which bars EPA from carrying out basic executive functions to ensure the prudent and effective management of substantial public funds.13IV.The district court also abused its discretion in applying the remaining Winter factors: irreparable harm to the plaintiff, the balance of the equities, and the public interest. While some grantees may be forced to shutter their operations during the litigation, their harms do not outweigh the interests of the government and the public in the proper stewardship of billions of taxpayer dollars.A.The loss of grant funds during this litigation is not irreparable because the harm is compensable through money damages. The district court concluded the grantees would suffer irreparable harm because their \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cbusiness operations \u2026 depend[] on their grant money. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117. But it is well-established that \u201ceconomic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm. \u201d Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C Cir. 2015) (cleaned up). Pecuniary injuries can be13 The grantees also argue EPA will violate the Appropriations Clause if it reobligates the funds after terminating the grant agreements. The district court did not base its preliminary injunction on this argument, so we do not address it. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 27 of 9228redressed through money damages if a plaintiff proves its case. We have recognized only one exception, for pecuniary loss that \u201cthreatens the very existence of the movant \u2019 s business. \u201d Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C Cir. 1985). This exception generally applies when government action threatens the existence of an independent private entity. See, e.g , Alpine Sec. Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., 121 F.4th 1314, 1329 (D.C Cir. 2024) (finding irreparable harm when a financial services firm would be forced to shutter if regulatory action took effect during litigation).The grantees do not fall within this exception. The nonprofit entities that may need to suspend operations are entities that were created solely for the purpose of applying for and spending these federal grants. So while their \u201cexistence relies on grant money\u201d as the district court held, that is because these entities were established to benefit from government largesse. Creating such an entity cannot establish an irrevocable claim to government funds or an entitlement to injunctive relief preventing the Executive Branch from supervising and managing those funds. In short, the existential threat alleged by the grantees does not amount to irreparable harm.EPA terminated the grants because of concerns about the integrity of the grantmaking process. While litigation is pending, the grantees may have to scale down their operations or return to the operational status they had before they received federal funds. Although this causes some harm, the harm is readily compensable through damages and therefore is not irreparable.B.The balance of the equities and the public interest factors similarly favor the government. The injunction harms the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 28 of 9229government and the public interest by preventing the Executive Branch from properly and prudently managing billions of dollars in public funds. The grantees have an interest in continued access to government funding. But the government and the public have a stronger interest in protecting the public fisc and eliminating the appearance of impropriety around these grant programs.Moreover, if the grant terminations are later determined to be a breach of contract, the government may be required to pay damages to the grantees, which would substantially, if not entirely, redress the grantees \u2019 interim injuries. By contrast, if the government \u2019 s position is eventually vindicated, it will have no apparent means to recover funds spent down while the litigation has run its course. See Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Order) (recognizing irreparable harm to the government because the grant \u201cfunds cannot be recouped and are thus irrevocably expended\u201d) (cleaned up). The government \u2019 s (and the public \u2019 s) harm from an erroneous injunction is thus irreparable in a way that the grantees \u2019 harm from an erroneous contract termination is not.Finally, Congress has explicitly channeled breach of government contract claims to the Court of Federal Claims and limited remedies to damages. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 (\u201cThe Court of [Federal] Claims may neither grant declaratory nor injunctive relief. \u201d) (cleaned up). The district court has no jurisdiction over these claims, and even the Court of Federal Claims lacks authority to issue injunctive relief. The public interest favors limiting federal courts to the jurisdiction and remedies provided by Congress. See Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2562 (2025) (\u201cWhen a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too. \u201d). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 29 of 9230The same considerations support vacating the injunction as to Citibank. The district court did not find that the grantees were likely to succeed on any of their independent claims against Citibank, which involve breach of contract, conversion, and replevin. To the contrary, the court found that \u201cCitibank performed its obligations under the FAA in accordance with its responsibilities as a financial agent of the United States. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The injunction against Citibank merely serves to stop Citibank from following the government \u2019 s instructions, which the district court considered unlawful. Because we conclude the injunction against the government should be vacated, the derivative injunction against Citibank must be vacated as well.* * *For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court \u2019 s injunction and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.So ordered. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 30 of 92PILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting: On the majority \u2019 s telling, Plaintiffs bring garden-variety contract claims against EPA \u2019 s reasonable decisions to terminate their grant awards. That version of events fails to contend with the government \u2019 s actual behavior and misapprehends Plaintiffs \u2019 claims, leading the majority to the wrong conclusion at every step of its review of the district court \u2019 s preliminary injunction.Three years ago, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. One of the law \u2019 s signature provisions directs the Environmental Protection Agency to distribute $20 billion in grants for investment in projects to develop clean energy infrastructure and manufacturing capacity. Congress structured the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to provide jobs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, especially in low-income and underinvested communities. EPA distributed the grant money by the fall of 2024, as Congress required.After the change in administration, in response to President Trump \u2019 s directives to terminate the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d new leadership at EPA decided to take back the money already awarded to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were holding and spending the money exclusively as Congress intended. Yet EPA\u2014in conjunction with counterparts at the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the U.S Treasury\u2014opened spurious criminal and civil investigations into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and pressured Citibank into \u201cvoluntarily\u201d freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts even though the government lacked probable cause to impose such a freeze. EPA then attempted to take back Plaintiffs \u2019 money by \u201cterminating\u201d all eight grants, comprising the entire $20 billion congressionally mandated program, 24 hours before the government was due in district court for a hearing on Plaintiffs \u2019 application for a temporary restraining order. Those unprecedented and unfounded actions were part of EPA \u2019 s hunt for reasons to shut down the congressionally mandated program and claw back the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 31 of 922funding that had already been disbursed to Plaintiffs and committed to infrastructure projects. EPA \u2019 s termination letter claims the agency conducted a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d but fails to identify any contract breach or violation of law by Plaintiffs.So far, EPA has succeeded in depriving Plaintiffs of access to their funding for six months. The freeze has already caused Plaintiffs to default on promised loans and scuttled affordable housing and energy projects implementing Congress \u2019 s vision. EPA has done all that without presenting to any court any credible evidence or coherent reason that could justify its interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 money and its sabotage of Congress \u2019 s law.Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s action to gut the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as contrary to the Constitution \u2019 s separation of powers. Fundamental to our \u201cconstitutional system of separation of powers\u201d is the \u201csettled, bedrock principle[]\u201d that neither the President nor his \u201csubordinate executive agencies\u201d may \u201cdecline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. \u201d In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259, 267 (D.C Cir. 2013); U.S Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9, cl. 7; U.S Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. Yet that is just what EPA decided to do and has begun to effectuate here. The record strongly supports the district court \u2019 s determination that EPA has frozen and attempted to repossess billions of dollars \u2019 worth of lawfully spent money for no substantiated reason other than disagreements with Congress \u2019 s policy determination\u2014grounds that are entirely inapposite and inadequate, and that the government does not defend here. The agency has no lawful basis\u2014nor even a nonfrivolous assertion of any basis\u2014to interfere with funding that, pursuant to Congress \u2019 s instructions, already belongs to Plaintiffs, who in turn have committed it to energy infrastructure development USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 32 of 923and advanced manufacturing projects according to Congress \u2019 s plan.That constitutional violation alone justifies the district court \u2019 s injunction. The injunction is independently warranted by the arbitrary and capricious character of EPA \u2019 s actions. Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s taking of their funds under an irrational process with only pretextual justifications. That is a quintessential APA claim that belongs in the district court, and on which Plaintiffs are likely to succeed.Defendants insist that this is a government contract dispute that we must dismiss because, under the Tucker Act, only the Court of Federal Claims has authority to decide it. Our Tucker Act precedents do not support that contention. They direct us to analyze whether a claim is \u201cat its essence\u201d contractual and, if it is, to cede jurisdiction to the Court of Claims for its expert \u201cknowledge of the government contracting process. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 76, 78 (D.C Cir. 1985). That analysis, turning on the source of the right Plaintiffs assert and the nature of the relief they seek\u2014here, constitutional and statutory claims to retain already-disbursed funds to which they remain lawfully entitled\u2014confirms the jurisdiction of the district court. Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968-69 (D.C Cir. 1982). The majority acknowledges the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 constitutional claims. And nothing in the Tucker Act or binding precedent interpreting it supports the majority \u2019 s view that Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim is transformed into a contract claim and ousted from the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction merely because it seeks to prevent EPA \u2019 s capricious interference with funds that Plaintiffs obtained through and must spend consistently with a contract. Maj. Op. 16-18. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 33 of 924In characterizing this case as merely a contract dispute subject to the Tucker Act \u2019 s jurisdictional bar, the majority baselessly strips the district court of authority to decide these important claims. The majority holds that a plaintiff cannot bring an arbitrary and capricious challenge to any government action that affects something of value that was originally obtained by contract. Maj. Op. 16-18. Doing so undercuts the Constitution \u2019 s and the APA \u2019 s checks on the Executive \u2019 s illegitimate seizure of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds and subversion of Congress \u2019 s will. The government \u2019 s Tucker Act defense is especially pernicious here. Dismissal of this case presumably will enable the government to carry out its announced plan to immediately and irrevocably seize Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. At best, in the unlikely event the government refrains from immediately draining Plaintiffs \u2019 frozen accounts, the further delay involved in reinitiating litigation in the Court of Federal Claims will itself irreparably harm the infrastructure projects that cannot move forward and may fail without funding. In these circumstances, \u201c[i]t is no overstatement to say that our constitutional system of separation of powers w[ill] be significantly altered\u201d by \u201callow[ing] executive . . . agencies to disregard federal law in the manner asserted in this case. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 267.BACKGROUNDA. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction FundIn 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The Act establishes the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to distribute that money for investment in projects to deploy solar and electric energy technology throughout the country, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065-67 (2022) (codified USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 34 of 925at 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434). The program was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and \u201cimprove health outcomes, lower energy costs, and create high-quality jobs for Americans\u2014all while strengthening [the] country \u2019 s economic competitiveness and ensuring energy security. \u201d Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) 3 (J.A 1735).Achieving that vision would \u201crequire a tremendous amount of financing and private capital for greenhouse gas- and air pollution-reducing projects across the country. \u201d Id. Because the private sector has historically been hesitant to invest in clean energy projects, Congress designed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to finance clean energy projects \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A). Specifically, Congress directed EPA to spend $20 billion by September 2024 to fund nonprofit financial institutions, which in turn must use the funds either to recruit private investment for clean energy programs or to assist community projects to reduce air pollution. Id. \u00a7 7434(a)(2)-(3), (c)(3).Pursuant to Congress \u2019 s directive, in July 2023, EPA created two funding programs: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit lenders to use public seed money to attract private investment for tens of thousands of energy-efficient affordable housing, transportation, and electricity projects throughout the country; and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit organizations to use public seed money to enable community lenders to invest in clean energy projects in low-income and underinvested communities.EPA conducted a rigorous, competitive selection process, which included review of applicants \u2019 detailed program plans USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 35 of 926and budgets, organizational capacity, and experience managing third-party capital and financial risk. EPA selected eight nonprofits\u2014lenders and community organizations\u2014capable of carrying out those aims. The approved workplans and budgets of the applicants EPA selected describe how those organizations will use the federal funds they have since received to expand access to\u2014and recruit private investment for\u2014affordable construction and renovation of energy-efficient businesses, schools, municipal buildings, healthcare facilities, public housing, and transportation, particularly in rural, Tribal, and low-income areas.In compliance with the September 2024 deadline Congress imposed, EPA obligated the grant funds for both programs by the summer of 2024. To enable the grantees to recruit private investment\u2014as Congress required, 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A)\u2014EPA deposited the grant funds in accounts opened in the grantees \u2019 names at Citibank. Unlike EPA \u2019 s traditional disbursement system, that structure gave the grantees title to the full amount of the award funds up front, allowing those funds to serve as assets for the grantees to rely on to raise private capital by reducing financial risk for private investments. See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 7-14.The Plaintiff grantees \u2019 legal title to their award funds is spelled out in Account Control Agreements between EPA, Citibank, and each grantee. Those agreements specify that Citibank \u201cmaintains the Accounts for the [grantee]\u201d and state that the grantee is \u201cthe Bank \u2019 s customer with respect to the Accounts and [] the entitlement holder with respect to all financial assets credited . . . to the Accounts. \u201d Account Control Agreement \u00a7 1 (J.A 1144). The Account Control Agreements accordingly direct that Citibank \u201cshall comply with all instructions\u201d it receives from the grantees. Id. \u00a7 2 (J.A 1145). The grantees \u2019 title to the award funds is also reflected in USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 36 of 927Citibank \u2019 s Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury, which requires Citibank to act as the government \u2019 s \u201cfinancial agent\u201d to achieve Congress \u2019 s goal by, among other things, establishing \u201caccounts in the names of the three NCIF and five CCIA grant recipients\u201d and maintaining a \u201ccustomer relationship\u201d with each grantee. Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A \u00a7 I.A.1 (J.A 2145).Under those agreements, EPA retained a security interest in the grantees \u2019 award funds that allows it to assert control over the money in certain circumstances if\u2014and only if\u2014it issues a Notice of Exclusive Control, which it undisputedly has not done. Form of Notice of Exclusive Control (J.A 1152); Oral Arg. Tr. 28:6-22. EPA has only an unexercised security interest; it does not own the funds in the grantees \u2019 accounts. See United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U.S 198, 209-10 (1983); Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S 356, 392 n.8 (2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting the distinction between \u201cthe government possess[ing] merely a secured interest in the property\u201d and \u201cown[ing] the funds\u201d).In addition to serving as the mechanism for conveying to the grantees legal title to the award funds, the financial agent structure affords EPA greater oversight of the grantees \u2019 use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system: While EPA \u2019 s traditional disbursement system reports only the amounts withdrawn by the recipient and the remaining award funds, the financial agent structure allows EPA real-time \u201cview access,\u201d enabling it to see the grantees \u2019 and their subrecipients \u2019 accounts to follow how much they are spending, with all amounts broken down by budget category, and to see income in the form of portfolio earnings and loan repayments. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 33 (J.A 372). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 37 of 928Other oversight mechanisms provide further, detailed confirmation of grantees \u2019 lawful use of their funds. Grantees provide extensive reporting to EPA on their spending. They make quarterly, semi-annual, and annual written reports regarding their transactions and progress against their EPA-approved workplans, plus quarterly conflict-of-interest reporting. They attend oversight, planning, and compliance meetings with EPA at least weekly. They submit to EPA withdrawal certifications attesting to the propriety of each draw request to Citibank and to its necessity for their workplan. And grantees are also subject to third-party financial audits and audits for federal grant compliance. Id. \u00b6 35 (J.A 372-73).The plaintiffs in this suit are five of the eight NCIF and CCIA grantees, as well as several of their subgrantees. Since mid-2024, they have been putting the grant money to work, committing to loans for projects around the country that will, for example: \u2022 develop and renovate hundreds of energy-efficient affordable housing units; \u2022 fund low-cost loans to small business and homeowners to finance heating and cooling systems and backup battery storage; \u2022 build a fleet of 500 American-made electric trucks to be conveniently and affordably available for lease by small businesses and independent contractors; and \u2022 provide backup power sources to rural hospitals to reduce the risks of harm to patients due to power outages.Those projects will help cut energy costs for consumers and small businesses, create jobs, ameliorate the affordable-USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 38 of 929housing crisis, and improve air quality in low-income and less developed communities.Plaintiffs \u2019 projects provide benefits to people and communities the value of which is many times greater than their cost to the public fisc. Congress structured these programs to enable each dollar of public funding spent to attract multiple dollars of private funding. One Plaintiff, for example, estimates that it will generate up to $4 of private investment for every $1 of federal funds invested in projects. Another Plaintiff \u2019 s workplan obligates it to mobilize $14 of private investment for every $1 of federal funding awarded to the Plaintiff. As of December 2024, it had already achieved a private-public capital mobilization ratio of nearly 7:1. But those projects\u2014as well as many of the Plaintiffs \u2019 ability even to remain in business\u2014cannot continue without Plaintiffs \u2019 access to the funds EPA awarded them. Plaintiffs \u2019 vulnerability to the freeze of their federal grant money is particularly acute given that many of the Plaintiffs were formed specifically to participate in the grant programs and as such do not have other sources of funding.B. EPA \u2019 s ActionsEPA \u2019 s campaign to seize the grant money already owned by Plaintiffs began shortly after the new administration took office, in response to its directives.

Nonetheless, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made clear his intent to take back the funds disbursed through those programs.On February 12, Zeldin released a public statement video in which he described the NCIF and CCIA grant programs as a \u201cscheme\u201d by the \u201cBiden EPA\u201d to \u201cpark[]\u201d 20 billion dollars at an outside financial institution in order to \u201cobligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight. \u201d Lee Zeldin (@EPALeeZeldin), X (Feb. 12, 2025, 7:52 PM), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP\">https://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP</url>.

The Justice Department first asked the Chief of the Criminal Division of the Washington, D.C , U.S Attorney \u2019 s Office, Denise Cheung, to open a criminal investigation into whether the NCIF and CCIA grants had been \u201cunlawfully\u201d awarded, so that the government could prevent the \u201ccontract awardees [from] continu[ing] to draw down\u201d their funds from their Citibank accounts.

When Cheung informed the Justice Department that probable cause to open a grand jury investigation did not exist, the Justice Department asked her to instead issue a letter requesting that Citibank freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 funds.While Cheung worked in coordination with the FBI to draft the freeze request letter to Citibank, she informed the Justice Department that the government lacked probable cause to believe that Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts were subject to government seizure.

Around the same time, the Deputy Attorney General asked at least one other U.S Attorney \u2019 s office to open a grand jury investigation into the NCIF and CCIA grant programs and seek a court-ordered bank freeze, but, like Cheung, those other prosecutors refused the requests as unsupported.

EPA stated that it was \u201cworking to review and develop additional account controls to address concerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of interest related to the [GGRF], including based on incoming responses to oversight questions EPA issued to grant recipients on March 4, 2025,\u201d and asserted that \u201c[t]he GGRF is also the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the U.S Department of Justice and an investigation by the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG). \u201d Id.EPA advised Citibank that, until \u201cadditional account controls are developed and implemented . . . and given the ongoing investigations into the GGRF, it is critical that the Bank not resume processing payment instructions for the GGRF accounts. \u201d Id.EPA stated further that \u201c[t]his interim account control will be rescinded as soon as reasonably practicable once EPA completes its review and implements additional account controls through additional instructions as necessary. \u201d Id.Meanwhile, Plaintiffs had already been unable to access the money in their bank accounts for over two weeks\u2014a period that has now stretched to more than six months. And because the terms of the grant awards generally prohibited Plaintiffs from withdrawing funds unless they would be spent in the following fourteen business days, Plaintiffs were starting to run out of money to make payroll, pay the rent on their offices, and pay third-party contractors for essential auditing, legal, and IT security services. On top of that, without access to their funding, they would soon be unable to meet their commitments under loans for projects they had already agreed to finance. Some of those loan payments could be requested by borrowers at any time; if borrowers requested a loan draw-down while USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 45 of 9216Plaintiffs could not access their funds, Plaintiffs would be forced to default on those loans, imperiling the projects.Plaintiffs remained unable to access the money in their accounts. They repeatedly requested an explanation from EPA or Citibank as to why their funds were inaccessible. They received no substantive reply. Climate United, for example, sent three emails, left a voicemail, and mailed a hard-copy letter to Citibank between February 19 and March 3 before finally receiving a response stating only that Citibank had \u201c received [Climate United \u2019 s] correspondence \u201d and was \u201cawaiting further guidance\u201d from EPA. Bafford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-51 (J.A 376-78). When Climate United contacted EPA on February 20, the agency at first offered Climate United a meeting the following week, only to reschedule the meeting three times before cancelling it and becoming entirely non-responsive to Climate United \u2019 s efforts to get in touch.At the same time that EPA was refusing to respond to Plaintiffs \u2019 requests for information, Zeldin made multiple public statements in which he claimed to have \u201cseen [] a lot of self-dealing, a lot of conflicts of interest,\u201d described the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as a \u201cclear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and a \u201ccriminal\u201d scheme, and vowed that EPA was \u201cnot going to rest\u201d until it had \u201crecover[ed]\u201d the grant awards.1After three weeks of being kept in the dark without access to their funds, Plaintiffs \u201chad no choice but to sue. \u201d Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 14:8 (J.A 187).

When Climate United agreed to EPA \u2019 s request \u201cas a professional courtesy,\u201d EPA used the 24-hour delay to send each of the grantees identical letters stating that their grants were terminated, effective immediately. Climate United Fund v. Citibank, 775 F. Supp. 3d 335, 343 (D.D.C 2025); J.A 390-91 (termination letter). The government then argued that the case should be dismissed as moot because the relief Plaintiffs sought\u2014an injunction preventing EPA from terminating the awards\u2014was no longer available, as EPA had already purported to terminate the awards.Rejecting EPA \u2019 s attempt to moot the case, the district court granted a temporary restraining order. It found that EPA had failed to provide any logical explanation for terminating Plaintiffs \u2019 grant awards. Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at 346-48. Instead, in declarations and two live hearings before the district court, EPA cited allegations of criminal activity and fraud that the court held were unsupported by any credible evidence. Id. at 347-48; see also id. at 346 (\u201cEPA Defendants proffered no evidence to support their basis for the termination . . . . \u201d). Rather than proffer any credible evidence, EPA merely pointed to the ongoing investigations by EPA \u2019 s Office of the Inspector General, the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2014each of which EPA had instigated based on the same unsubstantiated allegations for which it could not provide any credible evidence to the district court.

USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 47 of 9218By the time Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction a week later, EPA was still unable to provide anything more than \u201cunsubstantiated reasons\u201d for freezing their money and revoking their awards. Climate United Fund v. Citibank, 778 F.

Instead, EPA maintained that its \u201cbases for termination were the grants \u2019 structure and terms\u201d and that its termination decision \u201creflected no more than a decision based on reasons of policy,\u201d not anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d Opp \u2019 n to PI 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Climate United, 778 F.

Specifically, it found that \u201csuspend[ing] all eight grants comprising the entire NCIF and CCIA programs,\u201d coupled with \u201cthe agency \u2019 s public statements . . . regarding the future of the program,\u201d showed that EPA \u201cseeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter\u201d notwithstanding the agency \u2019 s hollow representations in court that it intended to re-obligate the funds following the terminations. Id at 115-16.By the time the district court granted the preliminary injunction in mid-April, Plaintiffs \u2019 inability to access their funding threatened to permanently unravel projects that depended on funding commitments they had incurred before EPA \u2019 s actions to undo the GGRF. A project to renovate 192 affordable housing units in Virginia could lose its $4 million in committed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding if a subgrantee cannot fulfill its funding obligations by September. Donovan Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 437-38). Projects to construct a community health center in New Jersey and to renovate a historic hotel into 63 rental apartments in rural Iowa were slated to lose their state tax credits and collapse if they did not receive a subgrantee \u2019 s planned funding by July. Moon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 25-26 (J.A 465-67). And construction of 302 affordable housing units in Texas and 236 units in Maryland will not move forward, and will eventually collapse, without a subgrantee \u2019 s committed funding. Donovan Decl. \u00b6 17 (J.A 436-37).Those harms have only continued to mount as the funding freeze has persisted, and for some projects, it is likely already too late. Due to one subgrantee \u2019 s inability to access its grant funds, a 106-unit affordable housing renovation lost its state tax credits in May, increasing the project \u2019 s cost and placing the project in jeopardy. Mayopoulos Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, Climate United,USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 49 of 9220No. 25-cv-698, Dkt. No. 112-1 (D.D.C May 12, 2025) (hereinafter Mayopoulos Supp. Decl.). Another project to construct a 160-home subsidized rental apartment community in Detroit most likely lost its critical HUD housing assistance commitment because of a subgrantee \u2019 s inability to provide a promised $4 million bridge loan in June. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Brown Decl. \u00b6 18 (J.A 437). And a $34 million project to build 90 rental homes in Texas was projected to fall through due to a subgrantee \u2019 s inability to provide its $3.6 million of committed funding by the end of June. Moon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (J.A 465).In addition to undermining existing projects, EPA \u2019 s actions will soon put many of the Plaintiffs themselves out of business, preventing accomplishment of the projects Congress intended them to fund. Without access to their funding, Plaintiffs are unable to make payroll, pay their bills, or keep current on their rent. Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117-20. Due to EPA \u2019 s interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to make payroll, many employees have started looking for other jobs, left voluntarily, or been laid off. For instance, one Plaintiff has laid off or lost approximately 50% of its staff, and one of its subgrantees was \u201cforced to act financially as though the GGRF award does not exist\u201d by laying off 36 of its employees. Mayopoulos Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. And because Plaintiffs cannot pay their bills, third-party contractors have started to withdraw essential services, including critical accounting, financial management, and award compliance services. Simply put, without access to their funds, Plaintiffs cannot keep their doors open, much less honor their loan commitments.More harmful still, faced with EPA \u2019 s threats to claw back Plaintiffs \u2019 funds, existing partners have begun to shun Plaintiffs \u2019 funding offers, pulling out of near-final deals and stopping working on Plaintiffs \u2019 projects. After eight weeks of negotiations, an Alaska-based community finance institution USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 50 of 9221had agreed to a $10 million loan from one of the Plaintiffs; all that was left to officially close the deal was the board \u2019 s approval. Following EPA \u2019 s actions, the board refused to approve the loan. That same plaintiff had completed negotiations with a local green bank in the Midwest to help finance a different project, with only board approval outstanding. The board met the day after Zeldin \u2019 s February 12 comments on X and voted against the loan because of Zeldin \u2019 s public threats and vow to end the NCIF program. A philanthropic entity interested in investing $250 million in a partnership with one of the Plaintiffs broke off discussions following EPA \u2019 s actions. Co-investment and collaboration is critical to Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to carry out Congress \u2019 s directive to efficiently finance projects to benefit the public by lowering \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A).DISCUSSIONAn accurate understanding of the program Congress enacted, together with the complete lack of evidence to support EPA \u2019 s false assertions of improper use or deficient oversight of federal expenditures, confirms that the district court \u2019 s decision to preliminarily enjoin EPA \u2019 s unlawful actions is unassailable. Based on nothing more than the President \u2019 s announced vendetta against the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d EPA determined to cut off access to money that was already disbursed to Plaintiffs and that they were using\u2014pursuant to Congress \u2019 s explicit directions as implemented by EPA\u2014to expand access to solar- and electric-powered housing, cars, buildings, and power generation. The Constitution does not allow the President or his subordinate executive agencies to unilaterally decide to take back money that Congress has appropriated and the agency already lawfully spent merely USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 51 of 9222because the Executive Branch disagrees with Congress \u2019 s policy choices. Neither do the laws governing federal agencies allow them to initiate specious criminal investigations in hopes of digging up pretextual justifications to cover up that unconstitutional action, let alone rely on the very existence of those investigations to interfere with Plaintiffs \u2019 lawful use of their money.EPA \u2019 s violations of law are so clear that the agency hardly contests them. And the imminent, irreversible harm to Plaintiffs is incontrovertible. These circumstances cry out for preliminary injunctive relief, as the district court rightly recognized. The majority \u2019 s contrary conclusion accepts the government \u2019 s gambit to strip district courts of jurisdiction over the government \u2019 s blatant violations of basic principles of constitutional and administrative law.Plaintiffs received the funds at issue here via federal grant awards. Absent EPA \u2019 s unjustified interference, the money in Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts is theirs to spend in conformity with the terms of the funding agreement. The government has expressly and repeatedly disclaimed any allegation that Plaintiffs have violated those terms. Neither has EPA attempted to regain control of the money by asserting its security interest in Plaintiffs \u2019 funds.EPA has instead frozen and purported to terminate the grant awards based on shifting, post-hoc, and unsupported allegations. Plaintiffs thus challenge EPA \u2019 s actions as arbitrary and capricious, and based on pretextual justifications. In no way is that claim \u201cin essence\u201d a contract claim over which the district court lacks jurisdiction. The reality that Plaintiffs obtained the funds by government contract does not mean that claims they raise against the government \u2019 s interference with their lawful use of those funds sound in contract. Our bindingUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 52 of 9223precedent makes clear that just because Plaintiffs \u201cwould have no claims to assert\u201d if they had never received the funds through a grant does not mean that they assert a \u201ccontract right. \u201d Crowley Gov \u2019 t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1110 (D.C Cir. 2022).The court \u2019 s holding to the contrary is unsupportable. The court falls short today in its Article III duty to independently say what the law is and thereby hold the Executive Branch to account. Such \u201c[a]bdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design. \u201d Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S 417, 452 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring).A. Likelihood of Success1. APAEPA \u2019 s conduct is arbitrary and capricious. Agencies may not offer \u201ccontrived reasons\u201d for their decisions, Dep \u2019 t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S 752, 785 (2019), nor can they make any decision that \u201cruns counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S , Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S 29, 43 (1983). It is beyond dispute that an agency \u2019 s own patently unfounded criminal investigations against private companies cannot be invoked to justify the factually baseless and legally unauthorized taking of the companies \u2019 funds. By all indications, that is exactly what EPA did here.Following the President \u2019 s instructions to cut off funding to clean energy projects, EPA vowed to \u201creassume responsibility\u201d of the NCIF and CCIA grant funds. To that end, without probable cause to suspect any criminal wrongdoing related to the grant programs, EPA\u2014in coordination with the Justice Department and the FBI\u2014first pressured Citibank into USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 53 of 9224voluntarily freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts by referring to \u201cpossible criminal violations,\u201d including \u201c[c]onspiracy to defraud the United States\u201d and \u201cwire fraud. \u201d FBI Freeze Ltr. (J.A 99-101). Not satisfied that Citibank \u2019 s voluntary freeze would hold, the agencies attempted to open a criminal investigation into the grants and impose a freeze of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds based on suspected criminal conduct. When those efforts came to nothing, EPA instructed the agency \u2019 s Office of Inspector General to open a civil investigation, immediately sent the referral\u2014including its unfounded allegations of \u201cself-dealing, conflicts of interest, [and] extraordinarily unqualified recipients,\u201d J.A 105\u2014to Citibank, and instructed Citibank to keep the accounts frozen until EPA was able to establish sufficient account controls.When that account freeze expired, the agencies again referenced \u201cpotential fraud\u201d and ongoing criminal and civil investigations to Citibank as support for an indefinite continuation of its account freeze, ostensibly to enable EPA to evaluate Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions. Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). But the very next day\u2014weeks before those responses were due, and mere hours before a hearing on Climate United \u2019 s TRO motion\u2014EPA used the 24-hour delay, which it had requested as a \u201cprofessional courtesy,\u201d to abruptly announce its putative termination of all the NCIF and CCIA awards. EPA then argued that the court should dismiss Climate United \u2019 s suit as moot on the ground that EPA had terminated its grant.When EPA could not point the court to any evidence supporting its allegations of fraud, Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at 346-47, it changed its tune. EPA argued to the district court and then to us that it terminated the grants not because any \u201cparticular plaintiff has engaged in a particular act that constitutes fraud,\u201d but only because of \u201cEPA \u2019 s lack of USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 54 of 9225oversight tools to ensure that the money wasn \u2019 t abused. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 103:9-15; see also Apr. 2 PI Hr \u2019 g Tr. 39:4-15 (J.A 868). EPA insisted that its oversight concern did not in any way depend on Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct\u201d\u2014despite the termination letters \u2019 references to \u201cfraud, waste, and abuse\u201d as a basis for the termination. PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507); Termination Ltr. (J.A 390).Each of those actions is consistent with EPA \u2019 s unlawful pursuit of a \u201cshort-term objective [] to prevent disbursement of the grant funds\u201d that had nothing to do with any valid concerns about fraud or oversight, and everything to do with the agency \u2019 s desire to carry out President Trump \u2019 s directive to block implementation of Congress \u2019 s environmental policy. Mar. 9 Emails, <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA\">https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA</url>. That is demonstrated most clearly by EPA \u2019 s pursuit of criminal and civil investigations that it hoped would \u201c uncover . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties \u201d to substantiate its asserted justifications for freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. Id. It pursued those baseless (and fruitless) investigations against the advice of at least two experienced federal prosecutors the EPA consulted and the ruling of a magistrate judge that there was no probable cause to believe any improper conduct had occurred.Equally revealing is EPA \u2019 s double-speak: EPA claimed publicly and in communications to the parties that its actions were justified because the program is a \u201ccriminal\u201d scheme and a \u201cclear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d that is \u201criddled with self-dealing, conflicts of interest, extraordinarily unqualified recipients . . . and much more,\u201d even as EPA insisted to the district court, which rebuked it for utterly failing to substantiate those allegations, and to our court, that it was not \u201caccusing\u201d and has never \u201caccuse[d] the plaintiffs of waste, fraud and abuse. \u201d Apr. 2 PI Hr \u2019 g 39:12-13 (J.A 868); Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-18. Such shifting and contradictory representations USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 55 of 9226further show that the oversight concerns EPA emphasizes as its sole basis for terminating the awards are post-hoc and pretextual. Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-21.The timing of the termination letters similarly undermines EPA \u2019 s purported oversight concerns. Only the day before terminating the grants, EPA instructed Citibank to extend the \u201cvoluntary\u201d funding freeze while it waited for Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions\u2014answers it claimed to need in order to evaluate \u201cconcerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of interest. \u201d Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). Later that day, Climate United moved for a TRO to prevent EPA from terminating the awards, among other requested relief. Instead of waiting for Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions\u2014which EPA had given Plaintiffs another several weeks to submit\u2014EPA abruptly terminated the grants the next day, less than 24 hours before the district court \u2019 s scheduled TRO hearing.That sequence of events\u2014terminate first, gather data later\u2014is emblematic of EPA \u2019 s approach throughout the events underlying this litigation. It is fundamentally at odds with the APA \u2019 s requirement of reasoned decision making. An agency must, at a minimum, \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. \u201d State Farm, 463 U.S at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted). By EPA \u2019 s own admission, it decided to terminate the awards before gathering the relevant oversight data, just as it decided to freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 money and launch criminal investigations without any reason to believe that Plaintiffs were engaged in \u201ccriminal conduct or other improprieties. \u201d Mar. 9 Emails. At every turn, EPA \u2019 s actions demonstrate that its purported reasons for terminating the grant\u2014its \u201c substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award progress, [and] USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 56 of 9227programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, \u201d Gov. Br. 33\u2014are entirely pretextual. Deciding the outcome before investigating the facts, unleashing the government \u2019 s prosecutorial power on private citizens with no basis to think fraud or crime occurred and, having uncovered no evidence, giving contrived and contradictory reasons for predetermined and unsupported agency action is quintessentially arbitrary and capricious. See Dep \u2019 t of Com., 588 U.S.at 782-85.EPA argues that it had legitimate concerns about its ability to ensure that the grant funds were being spent lawfully, making its decision to suddenly terminate the awards reasonable. Gov. Br. 33-34. But the oversight issues it cites are contradicted by the record. EPA \u2019 s explanation not only \u201cruns counter to the evidence before the agency\u201d and \u201cis so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,\u201d State Farm, 463 U.S at 43, but is patently pretextual.EPA points to the use of Citibank as a financial agent, the distribution of grant funding to subgrantee organizations, and modification of the agreement between the presidential election and inauguration as raising \u201cserious concerns\u201d about EPA \u2019 s ability to oversee Plaintiffs \u2019 use of the funds. Gov. Br. 9-11. From EPA \u2019 s telling, unqualified grantees were awarded enormous sums of federal grant funding with virtually no oversight. That narrative finds no support in the record.Start with EPA \u2019 s allegation that Plaintiffs are \u201cextraordinarily unqualified recipients\u201d who \u201chad no prior track record. \u201d Mar. 2 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 105); Gov.

Its coalition partners \u2019 past projects total more than $100 billion and have successfully added approximately 1.5 million affordable homes and apartments across the United States for Americans in need. Mayopoulos Decl. \u00b6 3 (J.A 452).Those coalitions are led by people of proven experience and integrity. Power Forward Communities itself is led by a former President and CEO of Fannie Mae who was also General Counsel of Bank of America; one of its subgrantees is led by a former director of the U.S Office of Management and Budget and HUD Secretary; and another of its subgrantees is led by a former Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo who also served as Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Such impressive leadership and proven track records make the coalitions eminently suited to fulfill Congress \u2019 s objectives. It is disingenuous of EPA to insinuate that the coalition structure implies Plaintiffs \u2019 lack of qualifications when it is \u201ccommon practice for established organizations to set up subsidiaries for specific projects and programs\u201d; coalition applicants were specifically invited toUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 58 of 9229apply for the grants by EPA; and the coalition partners and their leaders are extraordinarily qualified to administer the grant awards. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A 363); NOFO at 6 (J.A 1738). Nothing in the record materially disputes any of that.Nor do EPA \u2019 s purported concerns about conflicts of interest hold water. Start with the example selected by the majority. Maj. Op. 6 &amp; n.2 The majority highlights that, in urging its Office of Inspector General to open an investigation into the grant program, EPA \u2019 s Acting Deputy Administrator alleged that \u201cJahi Wise, the former director of the GGRF, personally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital [(CGC)]\u2014without recusing himself. \u201d Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPAOIG (J.A 107). But the record squarely contradicts that allegation. Consistent with \u201cEPA Order 5700.5A1, EPA \u2019 s Policy for Competition of Assistance Agreements, and the rigorous ethics and conflict-of-interest review carried out by EPA during the review and selection process for GGRF funding . . . Mr. Wise was recused from reviewing, evaluating, selecting, or approving funding on any grant competition for GGRF funding for which CGC submitted an application. \u201d Hopson Decl. \u00b6 22 (J.A 421). That is, in addition to recusing himself from CGC \u2019 s application for funding, \u201cMr. Wise did not even review applications from CGC \u2019 s competitors for GGRF funds. \u201d Id. Even EPA recognizes that its speculation about conflicts of interest does not support its termination decision. Indeed, after failing to present the district court with any evidence of fraud, conflicts of interest, or anything even approaching \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d EPA pivoted to argue that its decision to terminate the grants was solely \u201cbased on reasons of policy\u201d and did not have anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 59 of 9230EPA \u2019 s characterization of the grants \u2019 funding structure as an \u201cunusual and apparently improper\u201d \u201cscheme [to] remove[] $20 billion from governmental oversight in the days, weeks, and months before a new administration took office\u201d is similarly unfounded. Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPAOIG (J.A 107). As explained above, Plaintiffs received their awards as lump-sum payments which they held in accounts at Citibank, subject to a security interest held by EPA. That financial structure was specifically chosen to enable Plaintiffs to carry out Congress \u2019 s directive to act \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3). If the grant funds are to help attract private financing for clean energy projects, either by recruiting private co-investors or offering credit enhancements that make projects less risky for private investors, the funds need to be Plaintiffs \u2019 own assets and reflected on their balance sheets as such. See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 9-14; Bafford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32 (J.A 370-72). Under EPA \u2019 s standard grant disbursement system, in contrast, a recipient \u2019 s balance sheet reflects only the portions of the award that have already been expended, rather than the full award amount. Adherence to the agency \u2019 s default payment system would have impeded Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to recruit private capital. To effectuate Congress \u2019 s direction, EPA instead deposited the full award amount in Citibank accounts opened in Plaintiffs \u2019 and their subgrantees \u2019 names. That way, their balance sheets reflected Plaintiffs \u2019 ownership of the full amount of the award, even as they drew down funds from the account only as needed and in compliance with their obligations to fund projects and cover administrative costs.That funding mechanism was contemplated by EPA as early as July 2023\u2014long before any potential change in administration. See NOFO 55-56 (J.A 1787-88) (contemplating departures from standard EPA practice, including a \u201cone-time or periodic balance-sheet USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 60 of 9231capitalization(s)\u201d). And there is nothing improper about it. Rather, \u201cfederal financial agents\u201d like Citibank are \u201croutinely appointed\u201d and are specifically authorized by statute. Transactive Corp. v. United States, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C Cir. 1996); 12 U.S.C \u00a7 265. Most relevant to EPA \u2019 s litigating position, the financial agent structure affords EPA more oversight than the agency \u2019 s standard payment system. Citibank \u2019 s interface displays these grantees \u2019 and subgrantees \u2019 expenditures broken down by budget category and provides EPA with full, real-time view access into each of the grantees \u2019 and subgrantees \u2019 accounts. Those oversight features are absent from EPA \u2019 s standard disbursement system, which reports only the amount of money drawn down by the recipient. EPA \u2019 s determination that the \u201cprior administration \u2019 s designation of a financial agent . . . untenably reduced EPA \u2019 s oversight\u201d has it backwards. Gov. Br. 10.In the same vein, EPA asserts that, because some subgrantees may distribute award funds to other entities, EPA lacks the \u201cvisibility to see how [the subgrantees are] making those decisions or how that money is being used. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 34:2-4; see also Gov. Br. 10. That concern inexplicably disregards the many ways in which EPA can oversee the subgrantees \u2019 activities. EPA approved detailed budgets and workplans that specify how the subgrantees will use the grant money. Just like the grantees, every subgrantee must certify, under threat of \u201cprosecution under 18 U.S.C 1001 and other applicable criminal, civil and administrative sanctions,\u201d that each requested withdrawal of funds from its Citibank account is \u201cnecessary to execute against the workplan for the Subaward Agreement supported with EPA funding. \u201d Subgrantee Account Control Agreement, Ex. B (J.A 1189). And subgrantees \u2019 progress against that workplan is tracked and reported in quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports to EPA. For instance, Rewiring Community Investment Fund\u2014aUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 61 of 9232Power Forward Communities subgrantee\u2014describes how its inability to access its funding will prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its EPA-approved workplan, which include \u201cestablish[ing] a loan loss reserve to encourage lenders to provide loans with significantly discounted interest rates\u201d to households for energy-efficient, clean heating and cooling systems. Matusiak Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 447). Moreover, many of the subgrantees are financial institutions that are themselves subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators. JCF Ltr. at 3 (May 21, 2025).To the extent EPA takes issue with the fact that grantees may provide \u201csubgrants to others, who then pass it through to others,\u201d that is the structure that Congress, not the prior administration, chose to adopt. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(b)(2) (\u201cThe eligible recipient shall provide funding\u201d to \u201centities that provide financial assistance to qualified projects at the State, local, territorial, or Tribal level or in the District of Columbia, including community- and low-income-focused lenders and capital providers. \u201d).Tellingly, when one of the Plaintiffs responded to EPA \u2019 s asserted concerns about its ability to oversee subgrantees by proposing restructuring the $770 million of its grant funding that was slated for distribution to subgrantee community lenders, EPA ignored it. JCF Ltr. at 2-3. Under the proposal, the vast majority of the Plaintiff \u2019 s money would remain unspent in a segregated trust or escrow account that EPA could monitor. Instead of being distributed to the community lenders to lend directly, the funds would be used to secure the loans made by those community lenders to small businesses and communities looking to finance clean energy projects. In that way, the grant funds could have advanced the programs \u2019 goals USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 62 of 9233while largely staying put in an account monitored by EPA. EPA did not respond to the letter, despite repeated follow-up from the Plaintiff. Id. at 1. That lack of engagement further suggests that EPA \u2019 s purported oversight concerns are not the real reason it terminated Plaintiffs \u2019 grant awards.At bottom, each of EPA \u2019 s specific examples of oversight concerns is refuted by the record. And its broad-brush argument is simply untenable in light of the detailed oversight mechanisms available to EPA. EPA \u2019 s assertions that it had such grave oversight concerns that it had to cancel the grant awards overnight run aground on a conceded lack of any indication that Plaintiffs were out of compliance with the award terms, let alone that they were engaging in any conflicts of interest, fraud, or criminal activity. In addition to the real-time visibility Citibank provides EPA into Plaintiffs \u2019 and their subgrantees \u2019 accounts, EPA receives quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports detailing Plaintiffs \u2019 transactions, activities, progress against their workplans, and expenditures by budget category, as well as mandatory quarterly conflict-of-interest reporting by Plaintiffs and their subgrantees. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 35(a) (J.A 373). Before it purported to halt the program and itself disengaged from constructive communication, EPA had also held meetings with Plaintiffs \u201cat least weekly, and, at times, two to three times per week,\u201d to discuss their \u201cprogram plans, reporting, oversight, and compliance with the EPA Terms and Conditions. \u201d Id. \u00b6 35(b) (J.A 373); Arabshahi Decl. \u00b6 34 (J.A 1981). On top of those controls, Plaintiffs are subject to third-party audits and to \u201ctransaction testing\u201d by EPA, in which EPA conducts a \u201csystematic examination and verification of every dollar spent by [the grantee] to ensure they comply with the grant \u2019 s terms, conditions, and applicable regulations. \u201d Bafford Decl. \u00b6 35(g), (h) (J.A 373). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 63 of 9234EPA and the majority make much of the fact that the grant awards were amended in December 2024 and January 2025, claiming that these \u201clast-minute\u201d modifications in the waning days of the Biden administration were implemented to \u201cmake it more difficult for the government to terminate the agreements. \u201d Maj. Op. 5; see Gov. Br. 10, 34. EPA specifically contends that the original terms of the awards allowed it to terminate them \u201cbased on [a] change in policy priorities,\u201d per the version of EPA \u2019 s General Terms and Conditions in place before October 2024\u2014a contention the majority credits. Oral Arg. Tr. 102:17-25; see Maj. Op. 5 n. 1. That is incorrect.The original grant agreements, signed in August 2024\u2014months before the election\u2014already incorporated the termination provision from EPA \u2019 s now-operative General Terms and Conditions. Those General Terms and Conditions allow terminations of federal awards based on a change in policy priorities only when that basis for termination is \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d set forth in the award agreement itself. 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4), (b) (emphasis added). (Neither the EPA nor the majority contends that the award agreement itself, apart from the referenced regulation, allows the awards to be terminated based on a change in policy priorities.) The December 2024 amendment to the grant award thus did not alter the permissible bases for termination, which had never allowed termination for changed policy priorities.Plaintiffs \u2019 original award agreements specifically stated that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the General Term and Condition \u2018Termination, \u2019 [otherwise in effect before October 1, 2024,] EPA maintains the right to terminate the Assistance Agreement only as specified in . . . the version of 2 CFR 200.340 applicable to EPA grants as of July 1, 2024, pursuant to 89 Fed. Reg. 55262 (July 3, 2024). \u201d J.A 552 (emphasis added). The USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 64 of 9235version of the regulation the awards incorporated from the outset was the one providing \u201cthat an agency may terminate a Federal award if it no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities (e.g unilateral termination) but only when such language is clearly and unambiguously included in the terms and conditions of the award,\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 55,262, 55,263 (July 3, 2024) (emphasis added).EPA adopted that constraint pursuant to OMB \u2019 s invitation to agencies to opt into the revised rule before its default October 1, 2024, effective date. As of July 2024, EPA announced in the Federal Register that it had \u201cdecided to apply the revised version of 2 CFR 200.340 to EPA financial assistance agreements awarded or amended to add funds on or after July 1, 2024. \u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 55263. The December amendment thus imposed no new limit on EPA \u2019 s \u201ccontrol over [the] grant funding. \u201d Gov. Br. 10.The timing of the amendment also is entirely innocuous. EPA had explained shortly after the awards were announced in April 2024 that it would share draft award terms that month, and that it \u201cexpected the terms to change based on awardee feedback, to ensure they were clear and would be viable for awardee workplans. \u201d Bafford Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 367). EPA accordingly planned to communicate a \u201cfinal\u201d set of award terms in late June, followed by an iterative process during the fall and winter of 2024 in which EPA would receive grantees \u2019 suggested modifications based on their experience implementing the programs. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17-20 (J.A 366-68). Despite EPA \u2019 s and the majority \u2019 s insinuations to the contrary, nothing about the timing or content of those amendments supports Defendants \u2019 assertion that they were intended to reduce the agency \u2019 s oversight or control in the next administration. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 65 of 9236Neither does the \u201cgold bars\u201d video, which Zeldin repeatedly referenced in public comments smearing Plaintiffs, provide any plausible basis for sincere oversight concerns on the part of EPA \u2019 s new leadership. In the November 2024 Project Veritas video, an EPA staffer is shown saying to a peer on a Tinder date (who was surreptitiously filming him) that EPA was \u201ctrying to get the money out as fast as possible\u201d before Trump \u2019 s inauguration. Lisa Friedman, An Offhand Remark About Gold Bars, Secretly Recorded, Upended His Life, N.Y TIMES (July 1, 2025), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/FHM4-94R9\">https://perma.cc/FHM4-94R9</url>. Whatever the staffer may have meant, those comments cannot have been referring to awards under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund because those had been fully obligated as of August 2024 (in accordance with Congress \u2019 s September 2024 deadline). \u201cEPA Awards $27B in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Grants to Accelerate Clean Energy Solutions, Combat the Climate Crisis, and Save Families Money,\u201d EPA (Aug. 16, 2024), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A\">https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A</url>. Anyone with a basic familiarity with the GGRF program would understand that a video of a staffer \u2019 s bluster at a bar in November is irrelevant to the grants at issue here.In sum, the record makes clear that EPA \u2019 s abrupt termination of the grant awards on the eve of the TRO hearing cannot rationally be explained by reference to the agency leadership \u2019 s professed oversight concerns. That alone shows that the agency violated the APA, as EPA \u2019 s explanation for its decision to terminate the awards \u201cruns counter to the evidence before\u201d it. State Farm, 463 U.S at 43. Far more troubling, EPA \u2019 s dogged pursuit of criminal investigations unsupported by probable cause and its unsubstantiated public accusations of criminal activity strongly suggest that the agency \u2019 s professed oversight concerns are pretextual. EPA \u2019 s refusals to discuss its declared concerns with Plaintiffs themselves, engage with their responses, or even wait to consider how they would answer its USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 66 of 9237oversight questions give the lie to its widely trumpeted concerns. Contrived, baseless justifications for the grant terminations do not satisfy the \u201creasoned explanation requirement of administrative law,\u201d which \u201cis meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public. \u201d Dep \u2019 t of Com., 588 U.S at 785. The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201c[a]ccepting contrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise. \u201d Id. \u201cIf judicial review is to be more than an empty ritual, it must demand something better\u201d by way of reasoned explanation than the false statements EPA broadcast to build a sensationalist public narrative in its favor. Id.2. Separation of PowersIt is equally clear that EPA \u2019 s actions violate the Constitution. Our constitutional system of separation of powers rests on the idea that national \u201cpolicy is for Congress and the President to establish as they see fit in enacting statutes, and for the President and subordinate executive agencies . . . to implement within statutory boundaries. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 257. \u201cMoney is the instrument of policy,\u201d Clinton, 524 U.S at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring), and it is Congress\u2014not the executive branch acting unilaterally\u2014that has \u201cexclusive power over the federal purse,\u201d Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. E.P.A , 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C Cir. 1992). Only Congress may authorize \u201cmoney [to] be paid out of the Treasury. \u201d Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S 308, 321 (1937). And when it does so, the executive \u201cmay not ignore\u201d those funding directives \u201cmerely because of policy disagreement with Congress. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260.To hold otherwise would allow \u201cthe executive [to] possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation,\u201d 2USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 67 of 9238JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \u00a7 1348, at 215 (Thomas Cooley ed., 4th ed. 1873)\u2014the very concentration of power the Appropriations Clause was intended to prevent. See Cincinnati Soap Co., 301 U.S at 321. It is thus incontrovertible that, \u201c[a]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals. \u201d City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018). As then-Judge Kavanaugh explained, it is a \u201csettled, bedrock principle[] of constitutional law\u201d that neither the President nor his \u201csubordinate executive agencies\u201d may \u201cdecline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259. Insofar as the majority defends a prerogative of EPA to cancel the grants for policy reasons, the majority \u2019 s assertion that \u201cthe [Inflation Reduction] Act does not limit the Administrator \u2019 s discretion to withhold or terminate grants,\u201d Maj. Op. 23, squarely conflicts with Aiken.Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act appropriated federal funds for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and instructed EPA \u201cto make grants\u201d by September 30, 2024, to \u201cnonprofit organization[s] that [are] designed to provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial assistance for the rapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (providing funds \u201cto remain available until September 30, 2024\u201d and instructing EPA to make the described grants), (c)(1)(A) (specifying that \u201celigible recipients\u201d must be able to leverage private capital). The statute specifies that grantees, working in partnership with the private sector and with local communities, must provide funding and other assistance to housing and infrastructure projects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Id.USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 68 of 9239\u00a7 7434(b). EPA is constitutionally obligated to administer those grants; it cannot unilaterally decide to get rid of the grant programs based on the Administration \u2019 s policy preference to \u201c[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal. \u201d 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357.The district court found that EPA sought to do just that. It found that \u201cEPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter,\u201d as shown by EPA \u2019 s public expressions of determination to shut down the grant program, and as confirmed by its action to terminate \u201call eight grants comprising the entire NCIF and CCIA programs. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The district court \u2019 s factfinding is amply supported by the record, and the majority \u2019 s conclusion that it was clearly erroneous cannot be squared with EPA \u2019 s remarkable conduct in this case. Maj. Op. 25-26.As already discussed, EPA \u2019 s actions at every turn reveal its determination to permanently defund the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs for no more reason than that President Trump announced that goal. See 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357 (directing agencies to \u201cTerminat[e] the Green New Deal\u201d by preventing the \u201cdisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act\u201d). Without any further planning, consideration, or explanation, EPA acted to prevent Plaintiffs from accessing their funds. Current agency leadership has demonized the recipients as if the President \u2019 s policy preferences alone license them to slander as fraudulent or criminal any grantee whose activities do not align with those preferences. No matter that all evidence confirms that Plaintiffs were spending their money precisely as Congress intended and authorized.Indeed, EPA \u2019 s hasty decisions to freeze and terminate the grant awards with no evidence of noncompliance and no communication with Plaintiffs cannot be explained as anything USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 69 of 9240other than a decision to do what the President said he wanted only because he said so. The decision to terminate the grants just hours before the district court had a scheduled occasion to rule on whether to restore or preserve Plaintiffs \u2019 access to their award funds is hard to explain as anything but a bald effort to rewrite the statute and undo what was done in compliance with it. Those are not legitimate means to advance the new President \u2019 s policy agenda. Why terminate grant awards that had been made and were being carried out as Congress intended unless EPA \u2019 s real disagreement was with Congress \u2019 s legislated policy choice to fund \u201cgreen energy\u201d projects?The majority chides the district court for discounting EPA \u2019 s representations that it intended to reconstitute the grant programs with increased oversight. Maj. Op. 25-26. At oral argument, EPA disavowed any \u201cfrontal assault on the appropriation or Congress \u2019 s objective,\u201d insisting that the agency \u201cintends, as consistent with principles of appropriations law, to continue to make these funds available in a permissible way and in a way that comports with the oversight principles that it thinks are important here. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. at 25. But, as discussed below, since the appropriation \u2019 s deadline to obligate the funds has passed, EPA retains at most a narrow authority to make \u201creplacement\u201d grants and cannot obligate the funds anew.In any event, the district court had ample basis not to credit EPA \u2019 s representations that it will spend the funds as Congress intended. The court observed EPA \u2019 s track record throughout this case of making slanderous and insupportable public statements and disavowing them in court in favor of self-serving contradictory representations. The court knew that EPA instigated unsupported criminal and civil investigations to hunt for justifications to claw back Plaintiffs \u2019 money and observed that the agency remained unable to provide any USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 70 of 9241evidence to support its very public assertions of mismanagement and insufficient oversight. Presented with EPA \u2019 s actions and its patent inability to justify them on any other basis, the district court was on unassailably solid evidentiary footing in finding that EPA \u2019 s actions had nothing to do with its professed oversight concerns. EPA simply sought to \u201cdismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115.EPA \u2019 s \u201crepeated[] represent[ations] that it planned to re-commit the funds,\u201d Maj. Op. 23, ring entirely hollow in light of its patent inability to do so. See Bagenstos Amicus Br. 3-11.

Gen., Aug. 2, 2011).Federal appropriations law thus bars EPA from terminating the awards and then re-obligating the funds to reconstitute the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs. \u201cIf an agency deobligates funds after the expiration of the period of availability, the funds are not available for new obligations. \u201d Continued Availability of Expired Appropriation for Additional Project Phases, B-286929, 2001 WL 717355, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Apr. 25, 2001). In other words, once EPA terminates the grant awards, it will no longer have the authority to make new grant awards to fulfill its statutory obligations. The majority suggests that Congress \u2019 s repeal last month of the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 71 of 9242Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could affect EPA \u2019 s asserted authority to recommit the funds and thereby relieve it of any obligation to do so. Maj. Op. 25 n. 11. It does neither. The statute rescinds only \u201cunobligated\u201d funds: Obligated funds, like those at issue here, are unaffected. One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Pub. L. No. 119-21, \u00a7 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 155 (2025). See generally July 7, 2025, Neitzel Ltr. to Clerk of Court Cislak (noting that Senator Capito described the proposition that OBBBA might \u201cclaw back money\u201d as \u201cridiculous\u201d) (quoting Josh Siegel, Q&amp;A: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, incoming EPW chair, (Nov. 20, 2024), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9\">https://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9</url>). It is the federal appropriations rule, not the repeal legislation, that prevents EPA from recommitting the funds.EPA \u2019 s assertions that it will nonetheless fulfill Congress \u2019 s plan by labeling its re-obligations as \u201creplacement grants,\u201d Reply Br. 17, are empty promises. The majority, too, cites replacement-grant authority as evidence of EPA \u2019 s intent to continue the program with new grantees rather than terminate it. Maj. Op. 24 &amp; n.10 To qualify as a replacement grant, the re-obligation would have to be \u201csubstantially identical in scope and purpose to the original grant. \u201d The Honorable Lawton Chiles U.S Senate, B-164031, 1976 WL 10353, at *4 (Comp. Gen. June 25, 1976). Those requirements cannot be met by new grants that materially alter the financial structure, number of grantees, or other oversight controls\u2014meaning that EPA would have to retain the very features it claims prompted the agency to interfere with Plaintiffs \u2019 grants. See NRDC Amicus Br. 9-13.The majority reasons that, because \u201cthere is no evidence the agency sought to dismantle the programs without congressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees \u2019 claims. \u201d Maj. Op. 26. The majority \u2019 s factual premise USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 72 of 9243is unsupported, and the validity of Plaintiffs \u2019 separation of powers claim follows from Aiken County. We held in Aiken County that executive agencies violate the constitutional separation of powers when they refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress because they disagree with Congress \u2019 s policy choice. 725 F.3d at 260. There, as here, Congress appropriated funds for a particular effort (there, assessing applications to store nuclear waste; here, making competitive grants) and set a statutory deadline for the agency to act. Id. at 257-58. When the agency refused to adhere to the statute due to \u201cpolicy disagreement[s] with Congress,\u201d we held that refusal violated the Constitution, posing a threat to undermine \u201cour constitutional system of separation of powers\u201d that supported judicial intervention. Id. at 260, 267.EPA \u2019 s attempts to dismantle the statutorily mandated NCIF and CCIA programs due to the current agency leadership \u2019 s policy disagreements with Congress run afoul of the Constitution in the same way. In rejecting Plaintiffs \u2019 separation of powers claim, the majority says that it is \u201cdeclin[ing] to adopt a principle that would convert every statutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim. \u201d Maj. Op. 23. That may well be advisable, but it does not describe the rule of Aiken County that properly applies here. The majority cannot choose to \u201cdecline\u201d to apply our binding precedent. Wherever the line between constitutional and statutory claims lies, Aiken County squarely holds that EPA \u2019 s actions violated the Constitution.B. Irreparable Injury and Balance of EquitiesBaseless allegations of fraudulent or criminal activity, coupled with EPA \u2019 s unfounded interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 grant funds, threaten enormous harm to Plaintiffs and, more importantly, to the communities, businesses, and individuals USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 73 of 9244across the United States who stand to benefit from the uses of the money that Congress prescribed. Without access to their grant awards, Plaintiffs are already out of money to make payments for rent, third-party contractors, and insurance policies critical to continue operating, and many of the Plaintiffs will permanently shutter in the coming months. Plaintiffs have already been forced to defer compensation for, lay off, withdraw offers from, and lose employees with specialized expertise that \u201ccannot be replaced easily, if at all. \u201d Supp. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 7 (J.A 954).Absent funding from Plaintiffs, major projects already underway will fold\u2014projects intended to create demand for and boost the global competitiveness of U.S advanced electric manufacturing capability, provide critically necessary affordable housing and infrastructure, lower energy costs, improve air quality, and reduce climate risks across the United States. If the agency succeeds in taking back the funding provided under the Act, many of those projects will not be able to raise capital from other sources and will irrevocably fail. That is particularly likely because Congress directed grantees to invest in \u201cqualified projects that would otherwise lack access to financing. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(b)(1). As just a single example, one subgrantee community lender has set up projects to install clean-energy microgrids at churches, community centers, and nursing homes in rural Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama to provide sustained power during outages of existing power sources. Without the subgrantee \u2019 s promised funds, those projects are at risk of being left undone. The projects were intended to provide vulnerable populations with \u201cenergy independent safe havens for residents and community members\u201d during increasingly common extreme weather events; instead, when blackouts inevitably happen, \u201c[o]xygen machines that would be powered by solar panels during a blackout will turn off\u201d and \u201c[e]ssential medications that require USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 74 of 9245refrigeration will warm and spoil. \u201d Parker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37 (J.A 950).EPA \u2019 s unlawful actions are not just an enormous loss to Plaintiffs and the American people. They defy Congress \u2019 s objectives for authorizing and funding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund: to provide financial assistance to pollution-reducing projects \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 (c)(3)(A). By directing Citibank to freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 money, the government is making it impossible for Plaintiffs to serve as reliable funding partners, ruining their prospects for securing future partnerships, favorable loan terms, qualified staff, and federal grant funding. As one Plaintiff explained:To be an effective financing counterparty, CGC (or any organization) must have certainty of funding sources, be able to move efficiently and reliably in negotiations, and be viewed as credible by involved parties. CGC is made ineffective if potential partners cannot rely on when CGC \u2019 s capital will become available. No credible counterparty will take this funding risk, or be willing to be associated financially with CGC.Kauffman Decl. \u00b6 13 (J.A 429). That reputational harm is devastating to Plaintiffs. Because \u201cpart of [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] purpose is to bridge market failures and attract private co-investment to projects that might otherwise be deemed too risky, confidence in [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] commitments as . . . investor[s] is vital to achieving buy-in from private sector investors. . . . The longer the freeze on [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] funds continues, the more difficult it will be for [them] to originate deals and secure co-investors. \u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23 (J.A 430-31). Worse, the agency \u2019 s action contrary to Congress \u2019 enactment sets off a cycle of skepticism. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 75 of 9246When Plaintiffs \u2019 hard-won partnerships with private investors and community lenders initially hesitant to fund clean-energy projects evaporate, those partners will be all the more reluctant to invest in similar ventures in the future. Plaintiffs \u201chave had to work hard to build relationships and to earn a reputation as [] trustworthy, reliable lending institution[s],\u201d and the \u201cknock-on effects\u201d of the damage EPA has caused to their reputations \u201cwill delay adoption and therefore achievement of GGRF \u2019 s mission. \u201d Parker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (J.A 947).These harms are the very definition of irreparable injury. Once a lender \u2019 s reputation as a stable source of promised funding is compromised, it is difficult, if not impossible, to repair. Indeed, investors and loan applicants have already pulled out of near-final agreements due to the uncertainty over whether Plaintiffs will be able to access their funds. Projects underway that miss key deadlines due to Plaintiffs \u2019 inability to make good on their loan commitments will be shut down permanently.More broadly, the distrust bred by EPA \u2019 s actions will make it exceedingly difficult to revive the coordination and cooperation between nonprofit organizations, private investors, private businesses, and community lenders critical to carrying out Congress \u2019 s objective of building important projects at low public cost by spending government grant money to leverage private investment. What is more, without a court-ordered injunction, the government \u2019 s actions portend that EPA will drain the money from Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts with no apparent avenue for Plaintiffs to reclaim it. Once EPA successfully terminates the awards and moves the funds back to Treasury\u2014as it intends to do as soon as the district court \u2019 s injunction is lifted, see Oral Arg. Tr. 4:14-16\u2014it is unlikely that a court would be able to order their return to Plaintiffs or take any other action to fulfill the agency \u2019 s congressional mandate. See City USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 76 of 9247of Houston, Tex. v. Dep \u2019 t of Hous. &amp; Urb. Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426 (D.C Cir. 1994) (explaining that \u201ca court cannot reach\u201d funds that have reverted to Treasury \u201cin order to award relief\u201d when the appropriation authorizing their expenditure has expired); 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (appropriations for GGRF grant programs expired on September 30, 2024); see also generally Bagenstos Amicus Br. (explaining that EPA cannot re-obligate the grant funds, nor can a court order it to do so, because the appropriation authorizing those funds expired in September 2024). Under such circumstances, any eventual judicial declaration that the terminations were unlawful would be a hollow victory.On the other side of the ledger, the government claims that allowing Plaintiffs to access their funding will cause \u201csubstantial and irreparable harm to the public fisc. \u201d Gov. Br. 41. But as the government itself submits, its \u201cbases for termination were the grants \u2019 structure and terms\u201d which \u201creflected no more than a decision based on reasons of policy,\u201d not anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government insists that it is \u201cnot accusing anybody of fraud. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 27:16. That is, the government no longer disputes that Plaintiffs are using the award funds as initially instructed by EPA, and as mandated by Congress. It is hard to see how the public is harmed by Plaintiffs \u2019 use of money allotted by Congress to carry out its duly enacted policies.C. Tucker ActThe government attempts to divert this court \u2019 s attention from its brazenly unlawful actions by arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claims. But the district court at a minimum had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 77 of 9248meritorious separation of powers claim. That alone provides jurisdiction for the preliminary injunction.In any event, the majority \u2019 s conclusion that the Tucker Act bars Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA is wrong. Plaintiffs are not seeking reinstatement of their grant awards or any other form of specific performance of contracts. Nor are they seeking payment of funds from the Treasury. Their suit challenges the government \u2019 s decision to illegally seize their property\u2014money in bank accounts opened in their names, in which the government has only a security interest (which it has not exercised). The grant awards define that money as \u201cgross income earned by\u201d Plaintiffs, meaning that title to the money passed to Plaintiffs when the award funds were deposited in their Citibank accounts. Grant Award at 53 (J.A 1134) (quoting 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.1).Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the funds in their accounts is cemented by the Account Control Agreements between Citibank, EPA, and each grantee, which specify that Citibank \u201cmaintains the Accounts for [Plaintiffs],\u201d and that Plaintiffs are \u201cthe entitlement holder[s] with respect to all financial assets credited from time to time to the Accounts. \u201d J.A 1144. Citibank \u2019 s status as a \u201cfiduciary of the government,\u201d Maj. Op. 14\u2014in which capacity it promises to maintain accounts for Plaintiffs, allow them to \u201caccess and use funds\u201d in their accounts, and provide view access to EPA, Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A \u00a7\u00a7 I.A.1, I.D.1 (J.A 2145, 2149)\u2014changes nothing about Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the money in their accounts. That Citibank has a contractual obligation to the government to serve as a custodian of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds does not mean that the government owns the funds.Indeed, Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the award funds, which allows the award to serve as a liquid asset instead of an inherently USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 78 of 9249risky \u201cexpected income stream,\u201d is critical to Congress \u2019 s decision to equip grantees to attract private investment and is one of the reasons EPA selected the financial agent structure. Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 7-14. Plaintiffs thus seek an equitable remedy \u201cfor the recovery of specific property or monies,\u201d which stands in contradistinction to money damages, Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S 879, 893 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added), the \u201cprototypical contract remedy,\u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107.The nature of the relief that Plaintiffs seek\u2014recovery of property that is lawfully theirs\u2014suffices to resolve the Tucker Act question against the government. Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S 731 (1947), reflects that longstanding principle. There, the plaintiff sought an injunction preventing the U.S Maritime Commission from selling shares of stock that the plaintiff alleged it owned under a contract with the Commission. Id. at 734. The Court held that the district court had jurisdiction over the case even though the plaintiff \u2019 s alleged right to the disputed property originated in a contract and depended on interpreting the contract in its favor. The Court nonetheless recognized that the plaintiff \u2019 s \u201cclaim rests on [its] right under general law to recover possession of specific property wrongfully withheld\u201d\u2014a claim sounding in tort, not contract. Id. at 735-36. That was so even though the government possessed and had \u201crecord title\u201d to the property. Id. at 737. As the Court explained:[P]ublic officials may become tort-feasors by exceeding the limits of their authority. And where they unlawfully seize or hold a citizen \u2019 s realty or chattels, recoverable by appropriate action at law or in equity, he is not relegated to the Court of Claims to recover a money judgment. The dominant interest of the sovereign is then on the side of the victim whoUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 79 of 9250may bring his possessory action to reclaim that which is wrongfully withheld.Id. at 738.We acknowledged in Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis the line drawn in Land v. Dollar between claims to property acquired by contract\u2014which may proceed in district court\u2014and claims to enforce rights to contractual proceeds, which must proceed in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act: \u201cThe Supreme Court many years ago recognized a private party \u2019 s cause of action outside the Tucker Act to challenge the statutory authority of federal officials to claim ownership rights in property allegedly transferred during the course of a contract. \u201d 672 F.2d at 968-69. That principle confirms the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction here. Moreover, these cases underscore that a claim to recover property need not be framed as an unconstitutional taking to proceed in district court.Plaintiffs claim that EPA has unlawfully interfered with their previously disbursed funds in violation of, inter alia, the APA. Appellee Br. at 15. Plaintiffs assert that EPA has \u201cunlawfully seize[d]\u201d their property, and they seek an injunction to \u201creclaim that which is wrongfully withheld. \u201d Dollar, 330 U.S at 738. This case is even clearer in that regard than Land v. Dollar itself, because the government has neither title to nor possession of the disputed funds. Plaintiffs \u2019 action is one to recover their property. It does not seek any money from the Treasury. It is not a contract action so is not \u201crelegated to the Court of Claims. \u201d Id. As in Megapulse, Plaintiff \u2019 s \u201cposition is ultimately based, not on breach of contract, but on an alleged governmental infringement of property rights and violation of [a statute]. \u201d 672 F.2d at 969.The Supreme Court itself recently recognized that distinction in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine AdvocacyUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 80 of 9251Coalition, where it declined to stay a district court order requiring the government to issue payments owed to plaintiffs for foreign aid work they had already completed. 145 S. Ct. 753 (2025). The government argued there, as here, that the plaintiffs essentially sought to enforce a government contract so must proceed, if at all, in the Court of Claims. See id. at 756 (Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., dissenting from the denial of the application to vacate the district court \u2019 s order). The Court was unpersuaded that the government thus was likely to establish a sovereign immunity bar against the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction. Id. at 753. Like the grantees here, the plaintiffs in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition brought APA and constitutional challenges to defendants \u2019 interference with their existing entitlement to grant funding. Their claims depended not on breach of their contracts, but on the unlawfulness of the government \u2019 s actions. The district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 APA and constitutional claims here is even clearer than it was in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, because here, unlike there, payment was already made.Those same facts\u2014that Plaintiffs seek an injunction preventing the government from interfering with money the government has already properly disbursed to them\u2014renders inapplicable the Supreme Court \u2019 s emergency stay orders in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Ass \u2019 n, No. 25-A-103, 2025 WL 2415669 (Aug. 21, 2025), and Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025). I respect the reasoning of those orders where they apply, but no part of the district court \u2019 s injunction in this case \u201corder[s] the payment of money\u201d from the Treasury or requires the government to \u201cpay out past-due grant obligations\u201d or to \u201ccontinue paying obligations as they accrue. \u201d Dep \u2019 t of Ed., 145 S. Ct. at 968. And, unlike plaintiffs in National Institutes of Health, Plaintiffs here need not seek to enforce theUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 81 of 9252government \u2019 s \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d 2025 WL 2415669, at *1, because these Plaintiffs \u2019 money was already paid before Defendants interfered with it.Rather, what Plaintiffs seek here is to unfreeze their funds and to enjoin EPA from unlawfully interfering with them based on the President \u2019 s announced policy disagreement with Congress \u2019 s objectives. In doing so, Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s decision to replace Congress \u2019 s legislated policy choice with one aligning with the President \u2019 s directions. See Executive Order 14154 (ordering agencies to \u201cTerminat[e] the Green New Deal\u201d by stopping the \u201cdisbursement of funds\u201d); J.A 507 (Defendants opposition to motion for preliminary injunction describing contract terminations as \u201creflect[ing] no more than a decision based on reasons of policy\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115-16 (finding that EPA \u201cseeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter\u201d). To the extent National Institutes of Health applies here, it supports the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the policy-based interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. See National Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2 (Barrett, J., concurring) (asserting that a district court likely has jurisdiction over challenges to an agency \u2019 s policies).Binding precedent of this court anchors the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction. Our \u201clongstanding test for determining whether a claim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Claims Court pursuant to the Tucker Act\u201d confirms that the Tucker Act does not displace the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim. Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106. We explained in Megapulse that, in order to preserve the Court of Claims \u2019 exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cactions based on government contracts,\u201d a plaintiff whose \u201cclaims against the United States are essentially contractual\u201d cannot be allowed to \u201cavoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 82 of 9253the Tucker Act by casting its pleadings in terms that would enable a district court to exercise jurisdiction under a separate statute. \u201d 672 F.2d at 967. Whether a \u201cparticular action\u201d is \u201c\u2018at its essence \u2019 a contract action depends both on [1] the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon [2] the type of relief sought (or appropriate). \u201d Id. at 968. That is a flexible, context-specific inquiry that directs us to \u201cdetermine if the claim so clearly presents a disguised contract action that jurisdiction over the matter is properly limited to the Court of Claims. \u201d Id.Starting with the first prong, to determine whether the \u201csource of the rights\u201d of a claim is contractual, we consider whether the plaintiff \u2019 s arguments turn on the terms of the contract. In Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, for instance, we concluded that the plaintiff \u2019 s claims were not \u201ca disguised contract action\u201d because the plaintiff did not \u201cseek to enforce any duty imposed upon [the government] by the [relevant contract],\u201d nor did it \u201ccontend [the government] breached the terms\u201d of the contract or \u201cinvoke\u201d the contract in any other meaningful way. 864 F.3d 591, 619 (D.C Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in Megapulse, we were \u201cconvinced\u201d that the plaintiff \u2019 s claims were not \u201cdisguised\u201d contract claims by the fact that the plaintiff did not \u201cclaim a breach of contract\u201d and based its \u201crequest for relief\u201d on non-contractual documents. 672 F.2d at 969.Plaintiffs \u2019 APA challenge to Defendants \u2019 arbitrary and capricious action is clearly not a \u201cdisguised contract action. \u201d Their claim is not premised on EPA \u2019 s violation of the grant agreements \u2019 termination provisions, nor on its failure to perform any duty \u201cimposed\u201d on EPA by the grant award. Rather, Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to relief because EPA froze and seeks to seize their funds based on pretextual, internally inconsistent, and unfounded reasons. See, e.g , USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 83 of 9254Plaintiffs \u2019 Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (PI Mot.) 29 (J.A 327) (arguing that \u201cthe record leading up to the termination\u201d\u2014for example, the fact that EPA purported to terminate the grants several days after professing a \u201clack of critical information\u201d about \u201cconcerns regarding potential fraud\u201d that would be informed by an ongoing compliance review\u2014\u201chighlights the pretextual nature of EPA \u2019 s stated invocation of waste, fraud, and abuse\u201d). According to Plaintiffs, and as supported by the record, EPA acted entirely outside the bounds of acceptable agency action by first deciding to seize the money Plaintiffs had been awarded and then casting about for after-the-fact justifications\u2014including pressuring Citibank into freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 funds without any basis, notice, or explanation, and directing DOJ and FBI to open criminal investigations into Plaintiffs \u2019 grant performance without probable cause, or any grounds whatsoever. See PI Mot. 1-4 (J.A 299-302).That is precisely the type of arbitrary and capricious action the APA is designed to address. As the Supreme Court explained in Department of Commerce v. New York, agency action is arbitrary and capricious when the agency \u2019 s \u201cstated rationale was pretextual,\u201d because \u201ccontrived reasons . . . defeat the purpose of\u201d the \u201creasoned explanation requirement of administrative law. \u201d 588 U.S at 773-74, 785. The non-contractual \u201cessence\u201d of Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim has been clear since Plaintiffs filed their complaint and sought a preliminary injunction. They have from the outset sought to show that EPA \u2019 s vague, unsupported, and irrational justifications are merely \u201cpretextual cover to shut down a program approved by Congress that the new Administration does not like. \u201d PI Mot. 29 (J.A 327). That was clear to the district court from the very first hearing. See Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 9:17-18 (J.A 182) (district court observing that the terminations have \u201ca ready, fire, aim\u201d feel). Plaintiffs seek relief based on a quintessential claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action. The APA, andUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 84 of 9255not the contractual terms of the grants EPA awarded them, is the \u201csource of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.As for the second prong of the Megapulse analysis\u2014the \u201ctype of relief sought\u201d\u2014we have described the \u201ccrux of this inquiry\u201d as \u201cboil[ing] down to whether the plaintiff effectively seeks to attain . . . monetary relief from the federal government. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107. As explained above, Plaintiffs do not seek money from the Treasury; they seek only to get the government \u2019 s hands off their money. To the extent the injunction preventing the government from interfering with or seizing their funds \u201crequire[s] the same governmental restraint that specific []performance might require in a contract setting,\u201d that is an \u201cinsufficient basis to deny a district court the jurisdiction otherwise available and the remedial powers otherwise appropriate. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 971.Both prongs of the Megapulse analysis thus point to the same conclusion: Plaintiffs \u2019 claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action is not a \u201cdisguised\u201d contract action that must be heard by the Court of Claims. That conclusion comports with our longstanding recognition that the Tucker Act was a response to \u201ccongressional intent to provide a single, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. The \u201cunique expertise of the Court of Claims\u201d lies in its \u201cknowledge of the government contracting process,\u201d id.; it is a \u201cspecialized forum\u201d for awarding \u201cdamages for the Government \u2019 s past acts,\u201d Bowen, 487 U.S at 905 n.42, 908 (internal quotation marks omitted).It is far outside the specialized expertise of the Court of Claims to resolve these Plaintiffs \u2019 request for injunctive relief halting EPA \u2019 s naked pursuit of its preferred policy outcome in disregard for the evidence before it and its statutory mandate. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 85 of 9256Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that EPA violated the APA \u2019 s ban on arbitrary and capricious agency action\u2014a claim for which they seek injunctive relief, not payment from the Treasury\u2014is well within the district court \u2019 s remit.That Plaintiffs would have no right to the money to begin with but for the grant awards, which are government contracts, does not alter that conclusion. We have squarely held that the fact that a plaintiff \u201cwould have no claims to assert\u201d absent a government contract does not mean that the plaintiff asserts a \u201ccontract right. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110 (explaining that imposing such a \u201c\u2018but-for \u2019 test for identifying the source of the right . . . contravenes Megapulse \u2019 s express rejection of the argument that the mere existence of such contract-related issues converts the action to one based on the contract\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 610 (D.C Cir. 1992) (\u201c[L]itigants may bring statutory and constitutional claims in federal district court even when the claims depend on the existence and terms of a contract with the government. \u201d), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Perry Capital, 864 F.3d at 620.At bottom, the government suggests that Plaintiffs \u2019 real complaint is that EPA terminated their grant awards\u2014not that it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in doing so\u2014making its claim \u201cin essence\u201d a contract claim. It is obviously true that Plaintiffs are injured by the terminations. But it does not follow that Plaintiffs therefore assert contractual claims. When EPA began its campaign to undo the GGRF, it had already performed on the contracts by disbursing the funds, which by then belonged to Plaintiffs. The fact that those funds may only be used in accordance with grant terms does not mean Plaintiffs \u2019 only legal right to protect them arises from contract. As explained above, Plaintiffs \u2019 theory of relief is that EPAUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 86 of 9257carried out the funding freeze and purported terminations to replace Congress \u2019 s policy choice with its own preferred approach, without regard for whether its actions were supported by evidence or reason. That is a classic claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the APA. That is what makes the APA, and not their grant awards, the \u201csource of the rights upon which the plaintiff[s] base[] [their] claims. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.Because Plaintiffs bring legitimate APA and constitutional claims over which the district court has jurisdiction, I would not reach their ultra vires theory. But to the extent the majority concludes that Plaintiffs \u2019 ultra vires claim fails because Plaintiffs \u201cessentially\u201d allege only a breach of contract, the majority errs. Maj. Op. 21-22. For all the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs \u2019 claims are not \u201cessentially\u201d contractual.Citing Ingersoll-Rand, the majority posits that Plaintiffs \u2019 allegations of pretextual agency action are contract claims because \u201cthat challenge turns, in substance, on principles of federal contract law\u201d\u2014that is, Plaintiffs \u2019 pretext argument could be rephrased as a claim that EPA \u201cdishonor[ed], with impunity, its contractual obligations. \u201d Maj. Op. 17. But Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim is not \u201cessentially\u201d contractual just because EPA \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious action included grant terminations. The majority appears to read Ingersoll-Rand as establishing a rule that any claim that could be reconceptualized as a contractual violation that overlaps even in part with the claim Plaintiffs actually bring is necessarily a disguised contract claim. See Maj. Op. 16. Ingersoll-Rand announces no such rule, and any effort to interpret it to do squarely conflicts with our binding precedent.In Ingersoll-Rand, the government terminated its contract with the plaintiff \u201cfor convenience,\u201d as allowed under the terms USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 87 of 9258of the contract. Id. at 75. The plaintiff sued, alleging that the termination violated several regulations constraining the government \u2019 s ability to cancel and administer federal acquisition contracts, and that those regulatory violations meant that the termination was arbitrary and capricious. Id. at 77. We held that the \u201cessential rights at stake\u201d were contractual because the regulations themselves\u2014the violation of which was allegedly arbitrary and capricious\u2014concerned the conditions under which the government could terminate the contract. Id. at 77-78. In effect, the plaintiff had relied on regulations circumscribing the government \u2019 s behavior during the solicitation and performance of contracts to challenge the validity of the contract \u2019 s termination-for-convenience provision. The plaintiff \u2019 s claim thus \u201ccall[ed] for knowledge of the government contracting process\u201d and fell \u201cwithin the unique expertise of the Court of Claims. \u201d Id. at 78. In that context, in which the plaintiff \u2019 s claim centered on the intricacies of the government \u2019 s contracting process and the interaction between contracting regulations and the terms of the plaintiff \u2019 s contract, it made sense to hold that the plaintiff \u2019 s ability to \u201cchallenge the termination based solely on contract principles\u201d supported our determination that its claim \u201csound[ed] genuinely in contract. \u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).Ingersoll-Rand thus establishes that claims that invoke regulations governing federal contracting to challenge government action taken pursuant to a contract are \u201cin essence\u201d contractual and belong in the Court of Claims, where that court \u2019 s expertise in government contracting is particularly relevant. And it supports the majority \u2019 s conclusion that claims based on violations of regulations governing termination procedures are \u201cin essence\u201d contract claims, which is likely correct. See Maj. Op. 11-13. But that does not describe Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim. Ingersoll-RandUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 88 of 9259decidedly does not stand for a general rule that any claim that could have been framed as a breach of \u201cprinciples of federal contract law\u201d must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims\u201d Maj. Op. 17\u2014a rule that could not be squared with our other relevant decisions.That is illustrated most clearly by Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521 (D.C Cir. 1986), a decision authored by then-Judge Scalia and decided the year after Ingersoll-Rand. The plaintiff in Sharp challenged a Department of Defense policy removing him from the Ready Reserve where he served pursuant to a contract\u2014the Ready Reserve Service Agreement. 798 F.2d at 1521-23. The plaintiff alleged that the policy breached his contract and violated a statute governing the Ready Reserve, and that the contract gave him a \u201cvested property interest\u201d in serving in the reserves that the government \u201csought to deny without due process. \u201d Id. at 1523. The plaintiff \u2019 s requested relief included a declaration that the policy was \u201ccontrary to statute or in the alternative that it effects a material breach of the Ready Reserve Service Agreement,\u201d as well as a declaration that the government \u2019 s \u201cfailure to honor the terms of that contract deprived [the plaintiff] of due process. \u201d Id. We held that, while the Tucker Act barred the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s breach of contract claim, it did not displace the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s claims that the policy was \u201ccontrary to regulations, statutes and the Constitution. \u201d Id.; accord Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610. That is, the plaintiff \u2019 s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims that he had been unlawfully deprived of his contractual right to serve in the Ready Reserve were not \u201cin essence\u201d contractual even though his right to serve in the first place depended on contract, and he expressly brought one claim as a pure breach of contract. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 89 of 9260The majority \u2019 s view of Ingersoll-Rand cannot be reconciled with Sharp. Allen Sharp \u2019 s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims not only could be based on contract principles, but in fact were also framed that way. If the majority \u2019 s rule were right, the district court could not have exercised jurisdiction over his due process claim. The same analysis is confirmed in Megapulse itself. There, the plaintiff alleged that the government \u2019 s plan to distribute his data violated the Trade Secrets Act and deprived him of his property without due process. 672 F.2d at 962-63. That claim, too, could have been based solely on contract principles, as the government had made a contractual promise not to disseminate the plaintiff \u2019 s \u201climited rights\u201d data. Id. at 962. But that counterfactual did not preclude us from holding\u2014nor even factor into our conclusion\u2014that the district court had jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s claim. See id. at 966-71.Indeed, in Megapulse, we expressly rejected the idea that the Tucker Act means that \u201can agency action may not be enjoined, even if in clear violation of a specific statute, simply because that same action might also amount to a breach of contract. \u201d Id. at 971. Rather, district courts have jurisdiction over and can enjoin agency action that violates the APA, even if that action also \u201camounts to\u201d a breach of contract. Id. That is the situation here: Plaintiffs claim that EPA \u2019 s termination was arbitrary and capricious because it relied on pretextual and unsupported justifications, not because it violated the grant award \u2019 s termination provision. The fact that the government \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious decision making could be reframed as a claim that \u201cEPA acted with \u2018impunity \u2019 when terminating the grants\u201d does not transform the claim into a contract action.In relegating to the Court of Claims any statutory, regulatory, or constitutional claim merely because it arguably could to some extent be reframed as a contract action, the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 90 of 9261majority \u2019 s rule precludes district court jurisdiction and injunctive relief for a wide swath of claims that\u2014like Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that EPA \u2019 s actions to freeze their accounts and terminate their grants were arbitrary and capricious\u2014are simply not contract claims. Such a rule effects an unprecedented expansion of the Tucker Act that is divorced from the \u201ccongressional intent to provide a single, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes,\u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78, and it strips district courts of jurisdiction over all manner of claims over which they have the relevant expertise. It also threatens to \u201cpreclude any review at all of constitutional claims seeking equitable relief, where the constitutional claims stem from contracts,\u201d thereby raising \u201cserious constitutional question[s]. \u201d Transohio, 967 F.2d at 611 (internal quotation marks omitted). And it flies in the face of our cases \u2019 longstanding refrain that \u201cthe mere fact that a court may have to rule on a contract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, automatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the court of jurisdiction it might otherwise have. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968). Such a rule is unsupported by our precedent, prevents the court from making \u201crational distinctions between actions sounding genuinely in contract and those based on truly independent legal grounds,\u201d and runs directly counter to our acknowledgement that, \u201c[a]lthough it is important on the one hand to preserve the Tucker Act \u2019 s limited and conditioned waiver of sovereign immunity in contract actions, we must not do so in terms so broad as to deny a [district] court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than a contractual relationship with the government. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968-70.As applied in this case, the majority \u2019 s conclusion that Plaintiffs \u2019 claims are merely contract claims ignores what the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 91 of 9262agency did and describes a claim that Plaintiffs did not bring. This case is not an attempt to reframe EPA \u2019 s termination or violation of some grant awards as unlawful agency action. Indeed, throughout this litigation, there has hardly been any dispute that the government did breach the terms of the grant awards. That is not what this case is about. Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s asserted power to take baseless and unjustifiable actions to pursue its desired ends\u2014here, the termination of the grant awards\u2014regardless of the means it must employ to get there. It is beyond dispute that questions of such significance to the way our government operates are not relegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.CONCLUSIONEmbracing a misguided and breathtakingly expansive conception of the Tucker Act, the majority allows the government to seize Plaintiffs \u2019 money based on spurious and pretextual allegations and to permanently gut implementation of major congressional legislation designed to improve the infrastructure, health, and economic security of communities throughout the country. The injunction the district court put in place is eminently supported by Plaintiffs \u2019 likelihood of success on both their APA and constitutional claims, the irreparable harm that will befall them, and the unlawful nullification of Congress \u2019 s duly enacted policy\u2014all of which inure to the detriment of the American people.

And thank you for joining me for my 2026 Budget Address. I want to begin with a simple truth: a great city doesn't happen by accident; it's built to last. Built to weather tough seasons. Built to serve not just this year, but the next generation. Built to keep its promises to the people who call it home. That's what this budget is about: building a city to last. </p><p>As some of you know, this theme is personal to me right now. Just a few weeks ago, my wife Sarah and I welcomed our second daughter into the world: Estelle Bloom Frey. It's been beautiful. It's been humbling. And, like any new parent will tell you, it's been a little messy. But more than anything, it's been clarifying. Holding Estelle reminds me that the work we do here is not just about the next fiscal year. It's about the Minneapolis we're building for her, for my older daughter Frida, and for every family in our city.</p><p>A city where their streets are safe. Where their neighbors have homes. Where small businesses succeed and culture blossoms. And where city government isn't a punchline--it's a promise kept. This year's budget reflects that commitment. It's honest, disciplined, and focused on the core services that make Minneapolis strong so that decades from now, our city is still standing tall, still working for its people, still built to last. It is the most cliche, overused political, rhetorical flourish to say that budgets are more than numbers, they are expressions of our values. But some things are cliche because they are true. Budgets show what we prioritize and what kind of city we choose to be. And sometimes, that means not chasing every new idea but investing in the things that already work.</p><p>Doing the work</p><p>This budget didn't happen in a vacuum. Over the last several months, our City departments and budget team rolled up their sleeves. They went through their budgets line by line. They evaluated every program, every vacancy, every dollar spent. And they used data to come forward with real solutions to close our gap without breaking the services residents rely on. That's the kind of government residents expect, and I couldn't be prouder of their work.</p><p>Contrast that with Washington: agencies dismantled, departments hollowed out, services cut off midstream, and people left wondering if their government works at all. Here in Minneapolis, we do it differently: we plan ahead, we govern responsibly, and we bring our staff along. All of them. </p><p>Disciplined budget</p><p>Despite this hard work, this was not an easy budget year. But it's also not a crisis budget. This is a disciplined budget.</p><p>We knew this year would require focus and tough calls because good governance sometimes means refocusing and doubling down on what works. Our first and most important task was reducing the projected levy increase. In a post-pandemic world, the value of large office buildings is going down in every major city, and Minneapolis is no exception. Unfortunately, that has a pronounced impact on our tax base and budget. With no action, this year's property tax levy increase was projected to reach 13%. That would have been unacceptable and unaffordable to working families. The impact on renters and homeowners alike would have been unsustainable. Minneapolis has been a national leader on affordable housing, but a 13% levy increase would have set us back dramatically.</p><p>Today, I am proud to announce our City staff have identified savings and cuts that reduce the projected levy increase by 40%, bringing it down from 13% to 7.8%. Our approach to identifying these savings was straightforward: protect the core services our residents rely on every day; invest in proven programs instead of launching new ones that are untested or unsustainable; keep City staff--the people who make this city work--on the job; and do everything possible to keep the levy down, recognizing that this money belongs to the people of Minneapolis and we need to manage it wisely. </p><p>And we achieved all of this without layoffs. Because our people--our plow drivers, 911 dispatchers, housing inspectors, and public safety officers--are the backbone of city government. In a proud union city like ours, protecting those jobs protects the services residents count on.</p><p>We also worked smarter. In past years, departments submitted long lists of proposals for new programs. Last year, we had 145 new spending proposals. This year, we said don't give us any. Instead, we told departments: evaluate what isn't working or has shifted to other jurisdictions; identify programs that have delivered -- and distinguish them from those that have not; take a closer look at vacant positions and cut them if they aren't absolutely needed; and recommend reductions that don't impact core city services.</p><p>Here's what that looked like. Reducing Open Streets from four events to three, keeping the program alive but scaling responsibly. Sunsetting vacant positions that departments agreed weren't critical to operations. Shifting funding from untested new initiatives to ones we know work: like the Stable Homes Stable Schools program that's already keeping thousands of students housed. Scaling back select pilots that weren't yet operational. And ending double overtime for MPD - saving taxpayer dollars while still meeting our public safety obligations.</p><p>We also generated new revenue responsibly, with tools that are standard and resident-friendly. Adding credit card processing fees for utility payments, which many cities, the state, and the county already do. And expanding convenient payment options like Venmo, making it easier for residents to pay on time and avoid incurring a fee.</p><p>And let's be real: part of responsible budgeting this year was planning for the unknown. Washington, D.C. is in chaos. Federal cuts have become a regular threat. And with Donald Trump in office, the uncertainty isn't just about politics, it's about whether cities like ours can rely on federal partnership at all. That's why we budgeted intelligently. We saved where we could. Because when you don't know what's coming down the road, the smartest move is to make sure you're ready.</p><p>The result? $23 million in savings, a levy increase held to 7.8%, and a budget that reflects both discipline and vision, while making sure we're still able to provide necessary services to our residents.</p><p>Every decision came back to one question: Will this make Minneapolis stronger for the long term? Will this make Minneapolis a city built to last?</p><p>Building for the future</p><p>One of the reasons Minneapolis can make strategic, long-term investments--even in a tight budget year--is because we've earned and maintained a AAA bond rating from the three major rating agencies. I know that sounds like accounting jargon. But here's why it matters. A \"AAA rating\" is the highest a city can receive. It signifies strong, responsible financial management. And it saves taxpayers millions, because we can borrow for major projects at lower interest rates. That strong financial footing allows us to move forward on capital projects that make a visible, daily difference in the lives of residents. A few examples--</p><p>- Rebuilding the Nicollet Avenue Bridge over Minnehaha Creek. This $63 million project, mostly funded by state and federal dollars, will replace a failing bridge and keep a critical connection open for our neighborhoods.</p><p>- Reimagining the former Kmart site on Nicollet. We're reopening Nicollet Avenue and transforming the site into a vibrant hub with affordable housing, local businesses, and space for the community to gather.</p><p>- Minneapolis Democracy Center. At the former 3rd Precinct site, we're creating a new home for Election &amp; Voter Services alongside a community partner, turning a place of division into a place for civic engagement.</p><p>- Upper Harbor Terminal. Local artists are helping reimagine our riverfront, creating permanent public art that tells the stories of the Northside community.</p><p>These investments are the backbone of a city built to last--stronger streets, safer bridges, better transit, and corridors that support local commerce. And alongside these community-focused investments, our capital plan also fulfills court-enforceable commitments under the state settlement agreement and federal consent decree to modernize public safety, including:</p><p>- A Public Safety Training and Wellness Center to provide modern training facilities for police and firefighters.</p><p>- And 4th Precinct modernization and 5th Precinct roof replacement, along with an Evidence Warehouse, Forensic Garage, and K9 Facility upgrades--critical improvements that meet our legal obligations and strengthen safety.</p><p>All of these projects are possible because we've managed our finances carefully and responsibly.</p><p>Good governance today means a stronger, safer, more resilient city tomorrow.</p><p>Investing in the core of our city</p><p>Even as we tightened our focus, this is not an austerity budget. This is a recalibration--an investment in the fundamentals that make Minneapolis strong: housing; safety; climate; economic inclusion; and the good governance that ties it all together.</p><p>Affordable housing </p><p>At the foundation of a successful city is a safe, stable home.</p><p>We know that when families have a roof over their heads, everything else gets stronger: kids do better in school, parents can focus on work, and neighborhoods become safer and more connected. That's why this budget doubles down on the strategies we know are working.</p><p>Stable Homes Stable Schools continues to be a cornerstone of our housing strategy. Thousands of Minneapolis kids have stayed in their schools because their families were able to stay in their homes. We are keeping this program strong because it's not just housing policy that's proven to be successful--it's education and public safety policy too.</p><p>We're making ongoing investments in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which remains our most effective tool to keep housing in reach for all residents and creating more options so residents can live in the neighborhood of their choice. Year after year, this fund has delivered hundreds of units for the residents who need them most.</p><p>And we're continuing support for the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, because public housing is one of the most important sources of stability for thousands of residents. Every dollar we invest preserves long-term, deeply affordable homes for generations.</p><p>At the same time, we're growing and preserving housing, we're also confronting homelessness and encampments with urgency and compassion. Over the last several years, we've implemented a coordinated, multi-departmental, multi-jurisdictional response--connecting unsheltered residents to housing and services, and when necessary, closing encampments that pose health and safety risks. And we've seen significant improvements. With $1 million in funding - we're continuing that progress, investing in additional shelter because our neighbors deserve a place to sleep at night and a roof over their heads. Shelter is a critical link to permanent housing, and until recently--was covered by significant funding from the State. This investment recognizes that the work of getting unhoused people off the streets MUST continue, but we also must work together with our partners at the county and state to ensure those dollars are restored.</p><p>Our approach hasn't changed: lead with housing and services; prioritize safety for residents and neighbors; and coordinate every step with our partners. This work is hard. It's complex. But it is necessary, and our City team has shown that when we align our resources and stay persistent, we can get more people in homes.</p><p>In short, this budget says clearly: housing is the foundation. When we keep families stable, we keep our neighborhoods and our city strong.</p><p>Community safety</p><p>A strong city also means a safe city. And safety has the be the top priority for any mayor of any city. This budget keeps our city moving toward a 21st-century public safety system--one that is effective, accountable, and built to last. And we're doing it by investing in the full spectrum of safety, from first response to violence prevention.</p><p>First, we're continuing the work of police recruitment. The Minneapolis Police Department is the most diverse it has been in our city's history. Applicants and recruits are coming on board in numbers we have not seen in years - and we now have more than 600 officers.</p><p>We are fully funding the work required under our state settlement agreement and federal consent decree, and as planned in our biennial budget, we are adding two new compliance positions to the Implementation Unit. This ensures we don't just meet our obligations on paper--we follow through with the oversight, training, and accountability that build public confidence.</p><p>And public safety in Minneapolis isn't just about police. It's about a comprehensive approach. Our Behavioral Crisis Response program continues, connecting residents in crisis to the help they need. Our violence prevention efforts continue to focus on community-led, data-driven strategies that break cycles of violence before they begin. And we're maintaining our full sworn complement of firefighters, while also adding 15 firefighters to the general fund in 2026 to keep pace with service demands and keep residents safe.</p><p>Our emergency preparedness work also remains strong. Already this year, our Emergency Management team has put the training into action, preparing the City for multiple storms and making sure we're ready for whatever comes our way.</p><p>This is what a modern, resilient safety system looks like: a department meeting its legal and moral obligations, supported by civilian professionals, and prevention strategies--all working together to keep Minneapolis safe and built to last.</p><p>Climate action and public health</p><p>When we talk about building a city that lasts, it's not just about streets and bridges--it's also about the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of our families and neighbors. This budget makes real, tangible investments to ensure Minneapolis is both climate-resilient and healthy for the next generation.</p><p>On the climate front, we've done more to combat climate change in the last year than the previous 10 years combined. We are continuing to lead with our Climate Legacy Initiative (CLI), which through more than $8.4 million, is delivering cleaner energy, greener infrastructure, and a roadmap to meet our ambitious emissions goals. The CLI is retrofitting homes for energy efficiency, expanding renewable power across city facilities, and investing in neighborhoods most vulnerable to climate impacts. </p><p>Our Zero Waste Plan is moving us closer to a future where far less ends up in the landfill, and where every household has the tools to reduce, reuse, and recycle.</p><p>And through the Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction Project - we're providing $1.5 million in up-front capital to retrofit City buildings and equipment, cutting energy use, lowering costs, and shrinking our carbon footprint.</p><p>This is how you prepare for the impacts of climate change while keeping the city functional and beautiful.</p><p>On the public health front, we are confronting the opioid crisis with compassion and data-driven strategies. Through a combination of opioid settlement funds and federal grants, we are making key investments. Let me explain the vision we're working toward.</p><p>When someone is heavily addicted to opioids, help is often not accepted whether they're intoxicated or going through withdrawal. But there is a middle zone, where people are more open to accepting care. By investing in Brixadi, we can expand that middle zone, easing withdrawal symptoms so more people are ready for treatment and long-term recovery. And then, when we do bring someone in for treatment, we need health professionals ready to provide care immediately. Not in a week and a half, not when the next appointment becomes available, but right now.</p><p>That's where our Mobile Medical Unit comes in. It will drive literally to where people are at. It will offer service and care and ultimately, we can provide people access to Brixadi, making the likelihood of treatment and a possibility for recovery directly within reach. </p><p>But we aren't stopping there. </p><p>Our Narcan vending machines, will make sure life-saving overdose reversal medication is not only close at hand, but free. And through our hospital-based intervention program, First Step, we're connecting overdose survivors to treatment and support the moment they are ready to accept help.</p><p>We're doing the work to save lives, so that healthy people can live them. </p><p>Economic inclusion and small business growth</p><p>A strong Minneapolis is an inclusive Minneapolis--one where every resident, no matter where they come from or what barriers they face, can participate in our economy and see themselves in our city's success. That's why this budget continues to support the Ownership and Opportunity Fund, our tool to help Black, Brown, and immigrant local entrepreneurs not just open businesses, but build wealth and lasting roots in our city. Because inclusion isn't just about participation, it's about ownership.</p><p>We're also keeping up the investments that turn economic inclusion into real action. We're maintaining our support for Black businesses and immigrant entrepreneurs and families, because immigration is a cornerstone of our city's economic and cultural vibrancy. While the Trump administration vilifies immigrants, Minneapolis welcomes them. We are a proud Welcoming City, and that's not just a title, it's a commitment. Our policies, programs, and budget reflect that commitment by supporting immigrant entrepreneurs, expanding access to City programs regardless of status, and funding trusted services that help people build a life here. Because in Minneapolis, we don't scapegoat immigrants; we stand with them, invest in them, and grow stronger because of them.</p><p>Our budget also makes strategic investments to keep downtown clean, safe, and successful year-round.</p><p>We are moving forward with the reimagining of Nicollet Mall to a 24-hour downtown corridor that supports business, arts, and culture - including new events like the Big Honkin' Truck Parade and Dinner Du Nord. Expect more of them! </p><p>Vibrant Downtown Storefronts will continue to activate empty retail spaces, attract new businesses, and keep our street-level experience lively for residents and visitors.</p><p>And through the Developer Technical Assistance Program with $350,000 in funding, we are maintaining and improving the public spaces and amenities that keep downtown functional and inviting.</p><p>And then there's our parks system, the shining gem of our city. It's the very reason I chose to live here, and I know I'm not unique. Consistently rated as the best park system in the entire country, the Minneapolis Park and Rec Board has done extraordinary work expanding recreational opportunities for kids and families, maintaining and improving world-class facilities, like North Commons, and creating beautiful park spaces within a 10-minute walk of anyone that calls Minneapolis home. That's why they awarded us the gold medal of excellence, and why we're investing an additional $3.2 million in 2026 to keep this great work going. </p><p>These investments are not just about physical spaces--they are about confidence in our city's future. </p><p>A city built to last</p><p>Minneapolis is on solid footing. This budget keeps it that way by investing wisely in a city built to last. Homes that are stable; streets and bridges that are safe; a public safety system that is trusted and effective; a downtown that succeeds; a city government that works. That's the city I want our daughters--and every child--to inherit.</p><p>This budget says that in Minneapolis, we believe in doing the work. In making smart choices today to protect the city we'll hand off tomorrow. In keeping our promises to the people who rely on us. When our kids are adults, they won't remember this year's levy number. They won't know the line-item adjustments or the capital plan schedule. But they will live in the city we're building together. A city where their streets are safe. Where everyone has a place to call home. Where small businesses succeed in corridors that are alive with arts and culture. Where city government is not a punchline, but a promise kept.</p><p>We have done the hard work to make sure Minneapolis can weather the unknown, grow stronger, and keep moving forward. So, let's take pride in the discipline we've shown, the values we've upheld, and the future we're securing--together.</p><p>This is the city I love. This is the city I am proud to lead. And this is the budget I am proud to present.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>ADJOURNMENT</p><p>The meeting was adjourned at 10:28 a.m.Casey Joe Carl,</p><p>City Clerk4086697</p><p>publicnotices.finance-commerce.com</p>", "publisher": "BridgeTower Legal & Public Notice", "instances": ["5 million annually from Xcel &amp; Centerpoint; 5% of parking fee revenue, etc). 4.

SCAQMD's own analysis estimated these rules would have prevented 2,490 premature deaths and delivered $25.43 billion in health benefits over the coming decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Industry's aggressive misinformation campaign was unprecedented in all of the years we have participated in Air District rulemakings,\" said Earthjustice Senior Attorney Fernando Gaytan. \"By derailing these vital rules, I fear that industry has broken SCAQMD's rulemaking process, setting a dangerous precedent that industry can kill any rule it doesn't like through fear and misinformation to drum up manufactured opposition. We need far more transparency on industry's deceptive tactics, as the stakes for public health are far too high to let polluters wreak havoc on our local agency's ability to protect communities.\"</p><p>The rejected standards would have required appliance manufacturers to gradually increase sales of zero-emission technologies like heat pumps from 30% of all units sold in 2027 to 90% by 2036. They were developed over two years of public process, including eight public working group meetings and more than 100 stakeholder outreach sessions.</p><p>The rule's failure comes after months of an aggressive industry-led misinformation campaign to delay, and ultimately kill the rules. Led by an astroturf group calling itself the \"Cost of Living Council,\" industry opponents first succeeded in substantially weakening the original proposal several months ago and continued spreading fear and misinformation up until today's vote. Industry front groups and lobbyists have spread false claims about the rule's impacts to mobilize local government officials and state legislators.</p><p>\"After months of delays and substantial weakening of these common-sense standards, SCAQMD still voted to reject modest health-protective standards addressing pollution from gas furnaces and water heaters -- a major source of deadly smog,\" said Christopher Chavez, Deputy Policy Director, Coalition for Clean Air. \"The consequences of this decision will fall hardest on communities of color. We are extremely disappointed that SCAQMD caved to industry pressure instead of prioritizing the health of millions of Southern California residents.\"</p><p>Beyond public health benefits, the transition would have delivered significant savings on energy bills for families. According to a 2025 analysis by RMI, typical California households using gas heating and air conditioning can save $370 annually by switching to heat pumps with favorable electricity rates. Those currently using propane or electric resistance heating see even greater savings, with average annual reductions of $670 across all fuel types.</p><p>Andy Romanoff, Executive Director of Alaska Heat Smart, looks at a heat pump being installed at a home in Juneau, Alaska. (Michael Penn for Earthjustice)</p><p>Generous incentive programs, like SCAQMD's forthcoming Go Zero Rebate Program, make the switch even more attractive. Low-income families can save $2,400 to $4,200 upfront when choosing heat pumps over traditional systems, thanks to combined state, local, and utility programs. Heat pump water heaters offer similar upfront savings of $2,125 to $2,925.</p><p>\"The fight for our health and for families does not end here,\" said David Martinez, Climate Equity Organizer and Advocate for Climate Action Campaign. \"We will not rest until SoCal residents can breathe the healthy air they deserve and that SCAQMD is required to deliver.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/southern-california-air-regulators-reject-healthy-air-standards-caving-to-industry-misinformation-campaign\">https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/southern-california-air-regulators-reject-healthy-air-standards-caving-to-industry-misinformation-campaign</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9301820 MSTRUCK</p>", "publisher": "Targeted News Service", "instances": ["Low-income families can save $2,400 to $4,200 upfront when choosing heat pumps over traditional systems, thanks to combined state, local, and utility programs.

Once the group chooses an area, it plans to run a pilot project with the goal of electrifying all the appliances and adding solar panels and batteries for up to 80 homes.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're looking at the Coronado, Iron Triangle and Santa Fe neighborhoods, which are working class, Black and brown neighborhoods where ACCE has been organizing for years,\" Sharples said. \"They all have old gas lines that need to be replaced, so it represents an opportunity to electrify.\"\u00a0</p><p>To understand the appeal of neighborhood-scale decarbonization, which is also sometimes called \"zonal decarbonization,\" it helps to be able to envision the vast network of gas pipelines that exist under most cities in the Western U.S. That network holds a potentially explosive gas, and it requires constant, expensive upkeep.\u00a0</p><p>California has pledged to install <url normalizedValue=\"https://heatpumppartnership.org\">6 million heat pumps</url> by 2030 as part of its larger effort to reach <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/11/16/california-releases-worlds-first-plan-to-achieve-net-zero-carbon-pollution/\">net zero by 2045</url>. And while a <url normalizedValue=\"https://buildingdecarb.org/bay-area-rule-signals-a-new-era-for-building-electrification\">rule</url> will begin going into effect in the Bay Area in 2027 requiring that broken water heaters and furnaces be replaced by electric appliances, a similar rule was just <url normalizedValue=\"https://laist.com/news/climate-environment/southern-california-air-quality-regulators-reject-plan-to-phase-out-gas-water-heaters-and-furnaces\">rejected in Southern California</url>.</p><p>Experts say a large-scale effort just makes more sense than a piecemeal approach in many parts of the state. And as dramatic as it might sound to transition a whole block or neighborhood off gas at once, the approach may also cost less overall and make it easier to employ people fairly.</p><p>Neighborhood-scale decarbonization has also been popular with lawmakers. Last fall, the California Legislature voted to adopt <url normalizedValue=\"https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1221\">SB 1221</url>, a bill that will enable up to 30 neighborhood-scale projects of this type over the next five years.\u00a0</p><p>The catch is that most residents in the neighborhoods must agree to the change. While the state's obligation to serve currently requires 100 percent approval, SB 1221 will lower the threshold to 67 percent as the pilot projects start rolling out. Several groups have begun the work of educating communities about the benefits of the switch.\u00a0</p><p>In Albany, a city of about 20,000 people north of Berkeley, Michelle Plouse, the city's community development analyst, has spent the last few years working with PG&amp;E to pilot one of the first neighborhood-scale projects in the state. Using the gas line mapping tool developed by the utility, Plouse and other city staff worked with the Albany City Council to identify 12 potential blocks. This spring, they narrowed it down to three.\u00a0</p><p>The goal, Plouse said, is to find blocks that are easier to electrify while also focusing on lower-income parts of the city, where residents are less likely to be able to afford to electrify.\u00a0</p><p>\"What will happen if we don't decommission the gas line is that the cost of maintaining it will continue to increase over time, and the user base will drop as people electrify,\" said Plouse. \"The folks who don't have the money to electrify will be stuck on gas that will get more expensive every year.\"</p><p>The City of Albany received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for the project, and they've used the funds to support an outreach plan that involves a block party, a focus group and a team that goes door-to-door in hopes of talking to everyone on the three blocks. \"It's going to be a lot of listening and a lot of connecting with different people,\" said Plouse.</p><p>Rachel Wittman, a senior strategic analyst at PG&amp;E, said the utility provided a letter of commitment in support of Albany's DOE grant, but it won't be providing financial support for the project.\u00a0</p><p>Although the California Public Utilities Commission is soliciting interest from communities that want to take part in the SB 1221 pilot program, a spokesperson for the commission said it won't have a list of potential sites until the second half of 2026, at the soonest.</p><p>The Albany project will begin before then, so it won't likely be considered one of the 30 pilots, and Plouse said they're hoping to get 100 percent of the residents to sign on. \"What's most likely is that we continue serving as a kind of first test run that can provide information for those pilots,\" she said. If that doesn't work, they may decide to wait until they only need 67 percent resident approval.</p><p>\"Albany's learnings from their efforts in community outreach and advocacy during this project will provide valuable insights that can inform zonal electrification outreach strategy,\" said Wittman. \"This applies not just for SB 1221 and PG&amp;E, but for any utility or community.\" She said over three dozen cities, counties and other energy providers have reached out to the utility with interest in zonal decarbonization.</p><p>ACCE Action and others in Richmond hope its neighborhood-scale project-dubbed Clean Energy and Healthy Homes-will be included in the list of pilot projects, and it appears to have a good chance at making the list. If they're able to decommission a gas line there, Sharples estimates that it could cost as much as $15 million to upgrade and electrify homes spanning a few different neighborhoods and provide them with solar power. He hopes PG&amp;E will cover around 10 percent of that cost.</p><p>The Richmond City Council <url normalizedValue=\"https://pub-richmond.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=55457&amp;ref=grandviewindependent.com\">approved the effort</url> in early 2024, but the remaining funding is still in question. Chevron, whose local refinery has been a major polluter for more than a century, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/03/richmond-california-chevron-oil-00176922\">entered into a settlement</url> with the city for $550 million over the next 10 years to avoid paying a per-barrel tax on the oil it produces. ACCE Action wants to see a portion of that money spent on the neighborhood-scale project. The group has been hosting community events and engaging community members like Gomez.</p><p>Tim Frank, a representative of the Building and Construction Trades Council in the county, wants to see the project move forward because it could also create a model for so-called high-road work in the home electrification space. Currently, unionized workers tend to do larger electrification projects, while one-off residential projects are done by smaller companies not affiliated with unions. While some pay their workers well, many hire <url normalizedValue=\"https://localnewsmatters.org/2025/01/11/why-climate-change-is-fueling-efforts-to-bring-pay-equity-to-home-electrification-industry/\">temporary laborers and keep wages low</url>.</p><p>Electrifying all the homes on one block allows for the efficiency and stability associated with larger projects while benefiting individual families. It's also more cost-efficient because it allows for bulk purchases of supplies.\u00a0</p><p>It's a worthwhile experiment, Frank said. \"We're engaged, partly because we see the huge promise of this strategy and we want to help prove out the model and scale it up,\" he added.\u00a0</p><p>For Gomez, who has been talking to her neighbors about the possibility that all their homes could be upgraded and electrified at once, the biggest barrier is convincing them that it's not a scam. Richmond's low-income communities have seen their share of companies that go door-to-door trying to extract money from people who are stretched thin and working multiple jobs. Some clean energy providers have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/08/dont-waste-your-energy-solar-scam\">turned out to be imposters</url>.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's something they've never heard of before.

At the 2025 Empowerment Summit held May 14-16 in the heart of the nation's capital, the Houston Area Urban League (HAUL) was front and center, representing the Bayou City with unmistakable leadership. President and CEO Judson W. Robinson III and Executive Vice President Eric Goodie joined U.S. Congressman Al Green in amplifying voices for equity, clean energy opportunity, and legislative change that uplifts historically marginalized communities.The Empowerment Summit, a marquee policy event for the NUL, drew together an extraordinary coalition of Congressional leaders, community organizers, and civic advocates. With panels, policy briefings, and grassroots strategy sessions spanning multiple days, the Summit tackled America's most urgent issues-economic equity, environmental justice, and the ever-relevant call for civil rights.</p><p>Houston's Bold Footprint: HAUL's Impact in D.C.Representing one of the most active and impactful Urban League affiliates in the country, Judson Robinson and Eric Goodie arrived in Washington not just as attendees-but as frontline leaders in shaping a better future for Black Houstonians. Robinson, a legacy civil rights voice and the face of HAUL's modern expansion, brought his policy expertise to the Summit's Legislative Policy Conference, while Goodie, a champion for workforce development and economic justice, elevated strategies to build inclusive pathways in clean energy and homeownership.\"Equity is not a favor-it's a right,\" said Robinson during a breakout panel. \"And when we talk about empowerment, we're not just talking about access, we're talking about ownership-of our future, our economy, and our communities.\"HAUL's commitment to digital inclusion, workforce readiness, and financial equity was evident throughout the summit, especially during conversations that linked federal energy investments to career pipelines for underserved populations.</p><p>Clean Energy Jobs: A New Civil Rights FrontierThe Summit's opening day featured the Energy Jobs Convening, a high-impact event themed \"Growing with Clean Energy.\" Leaders like Eric Goodie participated in panels emphasizing workforce diversity and climate equity, exploring solutions to close the racial wealth gap by investing in education, skills training, and minority entrepreneurship within the clean energy sector.Goodie's message was clear: \"Houston is the energy capital of the world-but unless we're building equity into the energy transition, we're just trading one exclusion for another.\"His participation underscored HAUL's role as a key player in local and national clean energy dialogues-ensuring that Houston's underserved communities are prepared for and included in the 21st-century energy workforce.</p><p>Congressman Al Green Stands in SolidarityJoining the Houston delegation was none other than Congressman Al Green, whose fierce advocacy for civil rights and economic justice has made him a staple at every major social equity summit. His presence reaffirmed the interconnected work of federal policy and community upliftment.In his rousing remarks, Congressman Green declared, \"We do not beg for equality-we legislate for it. The Urban League is not just a movement of the past, but a mandate for the future.\"Green met with HAUL leaders and other Urban League affiliates to emphasize the importance of civic engagement, fair housing legislation, and the expansion of minority-owned businesses through federal support.</p><p>A Houston Legacy in MotionThe Houston Area Urban League continues to be a model affiliate in action and advocacy. From registering voters to supporting first-time homeowners, mentoring youth, and bridging the digital divide, HAUL is turning empowerment into daily reality.As Robinson shared, \"The work is never finished-but every policy we help pass, every job we help place, every voice we uplift-that's progress.

SCAQMD's own analysis estimated these rules would have prevented 2,490 premature deaths and delivered $25.43 billion in health benefits over the coming decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Industry's aggressive misinformation campaign was unprecedented in all of the years we have participated in Air District rulemakings,\" said Earthjustice Senior Attorney Fernando Gaytan. \"By derailing these vital rules, I fear that industry has broken SCAQMD's rulemaking process, setting a dangerous precedent that industry can kill any rule it doesn't like through fear and misinformation to drum up manufactured opposition. We need far more transparency on industry's deceptive tactics, as the stakes for public health are far too high to let polluters wreak havoc on our local agency's ability to protect communities.\"</p><p>The rejected standards would have required appliance manufacturers to gradually increase sales of zero-emission technologies like heat pumps from 30% of all units sold in 2027 to 90% by 2036. They were developed over two years of public process, including eight public working group meetings and more than 100 stakeholder outreach sessions.</p><p>The rule's failure comes after months of an aggressive industry-led misinformation campaign to delay, and ultimately kill the rules. Led by an astroturf group calling itself the \"Cost of Living Council,\" industry opponents first succeeded in substantially weakening the original proposal several months ago and continued spreading fear and misinformation up until today's vote. Industry front groups and lobbyists have spread false claims about the rule's impacts to mobilize local government officials and state legislators.</p><p>\"After months of delays and substantial weakening of these common-sense standards, SCAQMD still voted to reject modest health-protective standards addressing pollution from gas furnaces and water heaters -- a major source of deadly smog,\" said Christopher Chavez, Deputy Policy Director, Coalition for Clean Air. \"The consequences of this decision will fall hardest on communities of color. We are extremely disappointed that SCAQMD caved to industry pressure instead of prioritizing the health of millions of Southern California residents.\"</p><p>Beyond public health benefits, the transition would have delivered significant savings on energy bills for families. According to a 2025 analysis by RMI, typical California households using gas heating and air conditioning can save $370 annually by switching to heat pumps with favorable electricity rates. Those currently using propane or electric resistance heating see even greater savings, with average annual reductions of $670 across all fuel types.</p><p>Andy Romanoff, Executive Director of Alaska Heat Smart, looks at a heat pump being installed at a home in Juneau, Alaska.

She has a hunch that the pollution it emits is exacerbating her 10-year-old son's asthma attacks, and she has heard from public health experts and doctors who've said it probably is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I've learned that not only do we have contaminated air when we are outside in Richmond, but there's contamination and toxins within our homes,\" Gomez said in a recent phone call.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She started attending City Council meetings and organizing with her neighbors as a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) Action, because, she said, \"I wanted something different. I wanted something better.\"\u00a0</p><p>But ACCE Action's goal isn't simply to get rid of gas stoves. In a city where about one in four people-nearly double the national average-suffer from asthma due in large part to pollution from heavy industry, the group wants to shut off or \"prune\" the lines that send natural gas into homes in some neighborhoods. The phenomenon is called \"neighborhood-scale decarbonization,\" and it's just getting off the ground in California.</p><p>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the utility in the area, is on board with the idea. It has expressed a willingness to spend a portion of the money it would otherwise use to maintain gas lines to help electrify the homes in the neighborhood that will no longer use the gas.\u00a0</p><p>David Sharples, county director at ACCE Action, says the group is looking at different neighborhoods that PG&amp;E has identified as likely candidates. Once the group chooses an area, it plans to run a pilot project with the goal of electrifying all the appliances and adding solar panels and batteries for up to 80 homes.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're looking at the Coronado, Iron Triangle and Santa Fe neighborhoods, which are working class, Black and brown neighborhoods where ACCE has been organizing for years,\" Sharples said. \"They all have old gas lines that need to be replaced, so it represents an opportunity to electrify.\"\u00a0</p><p>To understand the appeal of neighborhood-scale decarbonization, which is also sometimes called \"zonal decarbonization,\" it helps to be able to envision the vast network of gas pipelines that exist under most cities in the Western U.S. That network holds a potentially explosive gas, and it requires constant, expensive upkeep.\u00a0</p><p>California has pledged to install <url normalizedValue=\"https://heatpumppartnership.org\">6 million heat pumps</url> by 2030 as part of its larger effort to reach <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/11/16/california-releases-worlds-first-plan-to-achieve-net-zero-carbon-pollution/\">net zero by 2045</url>. And while a <url normalizedValue=\"https://buildingdecarb.org/bay-area-rule-signals-a-new-era-for-building-electrification\">rule</url> will begin going into effect in the Bay Area in 2027 requiring that broken water heaters and furnaces be replaced by electric appliances, a similar rule was just <url normalizedValue=\"https://laist.com/news/climate-environment/southern-california-air-quality-regulators-reject-plan-to-phase-out-gas-water-heaters-and-furnaces\">rejected in Southern California</url>.</p><p>Experts say a large-scale effort just makes more sense than a piecemeal approach in many parts of the state. And as dramatic as it might sound to transition a whole block or neighborhood off gas at once, the approach may also cost less overall and make it easier to employ people fairly.</p><p>Neighborhood-scale decarbonization has also been popular with lawmakers. Last fall, the California Legislature voted to adopt <url normalizedValue=\"https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1221\">SB 1221</url>, a bill that will enable up to 30 neighborhood-scale projects of this type over the next five years.\u00a0</p><p>The catch is that most residents in the neighborhoods must agree to the change. While the state's obligation to serve currently requires 100 percent approval, SB 1221 will lower the threshold to 67 percent as the pilot projects start rolling out. Several groups have begun the work of educating communities about the benefits of the switch.\u00a0</p><p>In Albany, a city of about 20,000 people north of Berkeley, Michelle Plouse, the city's community development analyst, has spent the last few years working with PG&amp;E to pilot one of the first neighborhood-scale projects in the state. Using the gas line mapping tool developed by the utility, Plouse and other city staff worked with the Albany City Council to identify 12 potential blocks. This spring, they narrowed it down to three.\u00a0</p><p>The goal, Plouse said, is to find blocks that are easier to electrify while also focusing on lower-income parts of the city, where residents are less likely to be able to afford to electrify.\u00a0</p><p>\"What will happen if we don't decommission the gas line is that the cost of maintaining it will continue to increase over time, and the user base will drop as people electrify,\" said Plouse. \"The folks who don't have the money to electrify will be stuck on gas that will get more expensive every year.\"</p><p>The City of Albany received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for the project, and they've used the funds to support an outreach plan that involves a block party, a focus group and a team that goes door-to-door in hopes of talking to everyone on the three blocks. \"It's going to be a lot of listening and a lot of connecting with different people,\" said Plouse.</p><p>Rachel Wittman, a senior strategic analyst at PG&amp;E, said the utility provided a letter of commitment in support of Albany's DOE grant, but it won't be providing financial support for the project.\u00a0</p><p>Although the California Public Utilities Commission is soliciting interest from communities that want to take part in the SB 1221 pilot program, a spokesperson for the commission said it won't have a list of potential sites until the second half of 2026, at the soonest.</p><p>The Albany project will begin before then, so it won't likely be considered one of the 30 pilots, and Plouse said they're hoping to get 100 percent of the residents to sign on. \"What's most likely is that we continue serving as a kind of first test run that can provide information for those pilots,\" she said. If that doesn't work, they may decide to wait until they only need 67 percent resident approval.</p><p>\"Albany's learnings from their efforts in community outreach and advocacy during this project will provide valuable insights that can inform zonal electrification outreach strategy,\" said Wittman. \"This applies not just for SB 1221 and PG&amp;E, but for any utility or community.\" She said over three dozen cities, counties and other energy providers have reached out to the utility with interest in zonal decarbonization.</p><p>ACCE Action and others in Richmond hope its neighborhood-scale project-dubbed Clean Energy and Healthy Homes-will be included in the list of pilot projects, and it appears to have a good chance at making the list. If they're able to decommission a gas line there, Sharples estimates that it could cost as much as $15 million to upgrade and electrify homes spanning a few different neighborhoods and provide them with solar power. He hopes PG&amp;E will cover around 10 percent of that cost.</p><p>The Richmond City Council <url normalizedValue=\"https://pub-richmond.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=55457&amp;ref=grandviewindependent.com\">approved the effort</url> in early 2024, but the remaining funding is still in question. Chevron, whose local refinery has been a major polluter for more than a century, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/03/richmond-california-chevron-oil-00176922\">entered into a settlement</url> with the city for $550 million over the next 10 years to avoid paying a per-barrel tax on the oil it produces. ACCE Action wants to see a portion of that money spent on the neighborhood-scale project. The group has been hosting community events and engaging community members like Gomez.</p><p>Tim Frank, a representative of the Building and Construction Trades Council in the county, wants to see the project move forward because it could also create a model for so-called high-road work in the home electrification space. Currently, unionized workers tend to do larger electrification projects, while one-off residential projects are done by smaller companies not affiliated with unions. While some pay their workers well, many hire <url normalizedValue=\"https://localnewsmatters.org/2025/01/11/why-climate-change-is-fueling-efforts-to-bring-pay-equity-to-home-electrification-industry/\">temporary laborers and keep wages low</url>.</p><p>Electrifying all the homes on one block allows for the efficiency and stability associated with larger projects while benefiting individual families. It's also more cost-efficient because it allows for bulk purchases of supplies.\u00a0</p><p>It's a worthwhile experiment, Frank said. \"We're engaged, partly because we see the huge promise of this strategy and we want to help prove out the model and scale it up,\" he added.\u00a0</p><p>For Gomez, who has been talking to her neighbors about the possibility that all their homes could be upgraded and electrified at once, the biggest barrier is convincing them that it's not a scam. Richmond's low-income communities have seen their share of companies that go door-to-door trying to extract money from people who are stretched thin and working multiple jobs. Some clean energy providers have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/08/dont-waste-your-energy-solar-scam\">turned out to be imposters</url>.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's something they've never heard of before.

At the 2025 Empowerment Summit held May 14-16 in the heart of the nation's capital, the Houston Area Urban League (HAUL) was front and center, representing the Bayou City with unmistakable leadership. President and CEO Judson W. Robinson III and Executive Vice President Eric Goodie joined U.S. Congressman Al Green in amplifying voices for equity, clean energy opportunity, and legislative change that uplifts historically marginalized communities.The Empowerment Summit, a marquee policy event for the NUL, drew together an extraordinary coalition of Congressional leaders, community organizers, and civic advocates. With panels, policy briefings, and grassroots strategy sessions spanning multiple days, the Summit tackled America's most urgent issues-economic equity, environmental justice, and the ever-relevant call for civil rights.</p><p>Houston's Bold Footprint: HAUL's Impact in D.C.Representing one of the most active and impactful Urban League affiliates in the country, Judson Robinson and Eric Goodie arrived in Washington not just as attendees-but as frontline leaders in shaping a better future for Black Houstonians. Robinson, a legacy civil rights voice and the face of HAUL's modern expansion, brought his policy expertise to the Summit's Legislative Policy Conference, while Goodie, a champion for workforce development and economic justice, elevated strategies to build inclusive pathways in clean energy and homeownership.\"Equity is not a favor-it's a right,\" said Robinson during a breakout panel. \"And when we talk about empowerment, we're not just talking about access, we're talking about ownership-of our future, our economy, and our communities.\"HAUL's commitment to digital inclusion, workforce readiness, and financial equity was evident throughout the summit, especially during conversations that linked federal energy investments to career pipelines for underserved populations.</p><p>Clean Energy Jobs: A New Civil Rights FrontierThe Summit's opening day featured the Energy Jobs Convening, a high-impact event themed \"Growing with Clean Energy.\" Leaders like Eric Goodie participated in panels emphasizing workforce diversity and climate equity, exploring solutions to close the racial wealth gap by investing in education, skills training, and minority entrepreneurship within the clean energy sector.Goodie's message was clear: \"Houston is the energy capital of the world-but unless we're building equity into the energy transition, we're just trading one exclusion for another.\"His participation underscored HAUL's role as a key player in local and national clean energy dialogues-ensuring that Houston's underserved communities are prepared for and included in the 21st-century energy workforce.</p><p>Congressman Al Green Stands in SolidarityJoining the Houston delegation was none other than Congressman Al Green, whose fierce advocacy for civil rights and economic justice has made him a staple at every major social equity summit. His presence reaffirmed the interconnected work of federal policy and community upliftment.In his rousing remarks, Congressman Green declared, \"We do not beg for equality-we legislate for it. The Urban League is not just a movement of the past, but a mandate for the future.\"Green met with HAUL leaders and other Urban League affiliates to emphasize the importance of civic engagement, fair housing legislation, and the expansion of minority-owned businesses through federal support.</p><p>A Houston Legacy in MotionThe Houston Area Urban League continues to be a model affiliate in action and advocacy. From registering voters to supporting first-time homeowners, mentoring youth, and bridging the digital divide, HAUL is turning empowerment into daily reality.As Robinson shared, \"The work is never finished-but every policy we help pass, every job we help place, every voice we uplift-that's progress.

The interagency program also provides CSC certification and technical assistance.</p><p>Established in 2009, the interagency CSC Program provides guidance and technical support to local governments to take locally driven climate action. The first step to becoming a Climate Smart Community is to register by pledging to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. To date, 440 local governments representing nearly 9.6 million New Yorkers, or approximately 50 percent of the State's population, have adopted the CSC pledge.</p><p>About the Consolidated Funding Application</p><p>The Consolidated Funding Application was created to streamline and expedite the grant application process. The CFA process marks a fundamental shift in the way state resources are allocated, ensuring less bureaucracy and greater efficiency to fulfill local economic development needs. The CFA serves as the single-entry point for access to economic development funding, ensuring applicants no longer have to slowly navigate multiple agencies and sources without any mechanism for coordination. Now, economic development projects use the CFA as a support mechanism to access multiple state funding sources through one application, making the process quicker, easier, and more productive.

In February, researchers from Candid reported that at least 35,000 separate nonprofits were receiving at least half of their total revenue from federal taxpayers.</p><p>Overall, according to Candid, taxpayer financing provides $303 billion annually for more than 100,000 NGOs. That averages out to almost $900 spent for each American drawing a breath, or $3,600 per year for each household of four.</p><p>What the EcoHealth Alliance has done with its federal payments became a controversial mystery.</p><p>In May 2024 congressional hearings, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers criticized EcoHealth and Peter Daszak, its former president, for allegedly mismanaging and misrepresenting its corona virus research work with China's Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Some Republicans have publicly speculated that EcoHealth's grants to WIV assisted risky gain-of-function research that may have escaped from the lab.</p><p>In May 2024, the Biden administration's Department of Health and Human Services announced it was planning to hand down a rare, five-year ban on federal grants going to EcoHealth. According to the journal Science, EcoHealth Alliance fired Daszak on January 6, 2025. The federal prohibition against funding for EcoHealth and Daszak was formalized on January 17, during the waning days of the Biden administration.</p><p>Despite the outsized trouble it got into with the money, EcoHealth is far from the biggest of the BGOs or the only controversial recipient.

They reported not quite enough money to gas up a large pickup truck.</p><p>But in March 2024, Power Forward received its tax exemption from the IRS. The following month this brand-new tiny nonprofit was set up to become a great big BGO when it received a $2 billion grant award from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through its Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).</p><p>Similarly, the Coalition for Green Capital filed its first IRS report in 2014 and through December 2023 reported a cumulative total revenue of just $16.8 million, for an average of less than $1.7 million annually. But in April 2024, this small NGO was ready for a promotion to big-time BGO when it too received a $5 billion grant award from the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.</p><p>The GGRF was funded through the badly misnamed Inflation Reduction Act. GGRF's $20 billion carbon war treasure chest was supposed to assist LIDACs\"low-income and disadvantaged communities\" upgrade for so-called green energy.</p><p>If helping the poor were the real objective, then the GGRF pile of loot could have provided a $540 check for every American citizen living below the poverty linea $2,100 windfall for a low-income family of four. Instead, the money was divided among just eight initial recipients, including Power Forward and the Coalition for Green Capital.</p><p>But GGRF funding was still in escrow accounts at financial firms such as Citibank and not yet disbursed when the Trump administration arrived.

The economic vitality of our region's economy is inextricably tied to the energy industry - an industry that is changing rapidly to meet growing global energy demands while simultaneously lowering emissions. This effort to meet our dual energy challenge is known as the energy transition. The goal is for environmental and economic benefits of the energy transition to flow to all members of greater Houston, and it is important that historical disparities are addressed in the process.</p><p>The mission of the Greater Houston Partnership's Houston Energy Transition Initiative (HETI) is to drive sustainable and equitable economic growth for an energy-abundant, low-carbon future in the Greater Houston region. Critical to this objective, HETI seeks to ensure that community voices help guide climate and equity solutions to strengthen decarbonization efforts.</p><p>Community engagement is an iterative process that takes place over time, with multiple diverse and evolving stakeholders. A community can be defined as those who live in and around energy and energy transition projects or infrastructure, as well as those affected throughout Houston; there is not one set population size or geographic area that defines a community. It is critical to create an environment where open and productive dialogue can take place for the benefit of all involved, at a scale dependent on industrial projects and engagement goals. A leading best practice in community engagement emphasizes open communication, whereby a company works to understand and support local concerns, values, and goals, with a focus on mitigating disparities. Communication strategies can vary based on engagement goals and type of company; this document focuses on two-way engagement and sustained relationships between industry and communities. Building connections with community members includes careful, inclusive outreach to representatives of impacted communities and ongoing work to maintain and strengthen those relationships to promote shared benefits. A Framework for an Equitable Energy Transition and the Community Engagement Toolkit for an Equitable Energy Transition were developed to help foster mutually valuable relationships between leading energy companies with a presence in Houston and the communities they impact.</p><p>This report further serves to help corporations and communities build regional capacity for climate equity through community engagement.</p><p>This Framework and Toolkit are based on research and help to bridge an understanding between corporate climate action, community engagement, and the federal government's approach to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. The report can be used to support open, transparent, and meaningful dialogue, and to develop equitable solutions for the highest priority challenges as identified by communities while aligning with corporate impact objectives.</p><p>KEY FINDINGS</p><p>* Existing Priorities -- STEM education and workforce development have been prioritized by companies in engagement activities.</p><p>* Shift to equity -- Equity considerations have been increasingly important for companies to address in recent years. Communities are looking for authentic processes that include community input and benefits.</p><p>* Two-Way Engagement -- Companies and communities recognize two-way engagement as a best practice that could be implemented further.</p><p>* Meeting Community Needs -- Companies want to meet community expectations and avoid underservice, but highlighted the following challenges:</p><p>* Concern that the benefits they can provide, which may not include direct or immediate changes, may be perceived as underservice.</p><p>* Difficulty in navigation of processes within novel programs such as Justice40.</p><p>* Transparency -- Communities want transparency in the community engagement process and solutions that are tailored to each community</p><p>Access the report at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://htxenergytransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04.02.24_Climate-Equity-Report.pdf\">https://htxenergytransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04.02.24_Climate-Equity-Report.pdf</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

The event featured workers who have been directly impacted by the effects of climate change, Biden administration representatives, and racial justice, environmental and environmental justice groups. This event marked the launch of a series of discussions among labor, racial justice and environmental justice organizations aimed at addressing the impacts of climate change on working people and our communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Shuler and Secretary-Treasurer Redmond opened the event with remarks about the threat that climate change poses to all workers disproportionately affecting Black and Brown workersand outlining the AFL-CIO's robust strategy for advancing environmental and racial justice in the labor movement.

The student-led Food Recovery Network aims to promote sustainability and food security, and to raise awareness about issues surrounding food waste. The organization recovers unserved food from four University Park dining halls and transports it to student and community partners. In its first year, more than 2,500 pounds of food were rescued and redistributed, thereby preventing waste from being sent to landfills. This prevented the release of more than 9,500 pounds of carbon dioxide from decaying food waste, according to the organization's annual report. Since the chapter's emergence, this mitigation has increased exponentially from 9,500 pounds to more than 23,200 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions. The Food Recovery Network student team accepting the award includes Adeline Peat, Anna Janaszek, Emmanuel Kraft, Anant Pothakamury, Irini Gentis and Eliana Wong.</p><p>The 2025 Sustainability Awards highlight the comprehensive efforts across Penn State to advance sustainability in education, research, operations and community engagement.

In addition to being the setting for classic myths, labyrinths are also a place where, with each thoughtful step, one can wander and process topics weighing heavily on the mind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UConn Department of Sociology Professor-in-Residence Phoebe Godfrey, Department of Geography, Sustainability, Community and Urban Studies Professor Carol Atkinson-Palombo, and students recently installed a temporary labyrinth on campus to raise awareness for the possibility of a permanent remembrance labyrinth on the Storrs campus. The temporary chalk labyrinth can be found in between the Austin Building and Beach Hall until the next rain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Godfrey is inspired to advocate for a future labyrinth as a place on campus where people can gather, and temporary labyrinths are a great way to share the idea and purpose of the project. \"My classes are all linked to helping students connect more deeply with their bodies, and the Earth as part of their and planetary well-being, and labyrinths are a great way to do this, says Godfrey. Many other schools have built them for similar reasons, including a small one at Eastern Connecticut State University.</p><p>After the success of the buddy bench project, Godfrey connected with UConn's Director of Site Planning and University Landscape Architect Sean Vasington with the idea.</p><p>\"For decades prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and since, health care providers have emphasized the importance of natural and built environments and their influence on our overall health and wellbeing, recommending nature-based programs as one way to help alleviate stress, Vasington says. There is also a strong connection between the quality of the conditions and features of a campus landscape and the mental health of students, including their ability to perform to their full potential academically. UConn is fortunate to have beautiful, open grounds and forests with ample walking paths and communal sitting areas; however it can also benefit from more quiet, reflective spaces within the campus core that connect us to nature. The proposed garden and labyrinth will do just that.</p><p>Godfrey also attended a conference and met with educators at the University of Massachusetts who are working toward building a permanent installation on their campus. The UMass project has been underway for almost 10 years, and was bolstered by a study that suggested that labyrinth walking can lower blood pressure and pulse rate and increase overall satisfaction.</p><p>As with the current labyrinth installation, in Spring 2024 a temporary labyrinth was constructed between the Austin Building and Beach Hall for Earth Day. The installation included a journal for participants to share their thoughts or reflections, and the response was greater than anticipated.</p><p>Godfrey says around 25 people who visited the labyrinth last year wrote in the journal about their positive experiences interacting with the labyrinth.</p><p>\"The diverse and yet collectively positive impact of labyrinths on university students has been documented,\" says Godfrey. \"Positive impacts include mental health and well-being, connecting walkers to a sense of place, sacredness and an ancient practice, and offering opportunities for lessons in contemplation and self-care. These claims were and continue to be supported by our student testimonies.</p><p>Ella Barnett '24 (CLAS) helped with the construction of the labyrinth last spring and came back this year as an alum to help and document this year's labyrinth through photography.</p><p>\"It has been beautiful to watch the labyrinth come to life for the second year in a row. I am grateful that it is able to create a space where individuals have an excuse to connect on the simplest terms, being a human with thought on Earth, says Barnett.</p><p>Eduen Smith '25 (CLAS) also helped construct this spring's labyrinth.</p><p>\"This pop-up labyrinth is linked to a pop-up class from last fall based on the book All We Can Save.' The signs you see at the labyrinth were made by the students in class. They showcase some excerpts from various pieces in the book,\" says Smith. For me, this labyrinth is an example of how our students should be supported. A labyrinth is a simple creation that can impact folx's mental health in profoundly positive ways. It'd also be a great permanent addition to our campus and even help beautify it!\"</p><p>Though the spring installation was created with spray paint, other types of temporary labyrinths can be projected by light, constructed with yarn, or made of canvas or any other material the creative possibilities are endless.</p><p>The potential project was granted space behind Arjona and engineered a few years ago, but to make it happen, Godfrey says, new momentum must be generated by recognizing the value of such ancient practice for our students now and into the future.</p><p>\"The next challenge is to raise funding to complete the design and installation. Based on the success of the previous temporary installation, we hope this Spring installation will continue to build awareness and support for our permanent version,\" says Godfrey.</p><p>When the weather is nice, people gather around Mirror Lake or Swan Lake, and landmarks like the former beloved Swing Tree and the buddy benches serve as areas where people can sit and enjoy the scenery. The labyrinth project's collaborators hope the plan goes forward so the labyrinth can be another place on campus where students can hang out and enjoy the outdoors. In the meantime, to alleviate the end-of-semester stress, spend some time decompressing while you explore the latest temporary labyrinth installation.</p><p>The importance of decompressing and living in the moment is illustrated by a quote from a student who left a reflection of their time in the labyrinth in the journal:</p><p>\"My intention entering the labyrinth was to let go of this sense of hopelessness that has taken over me recently. As I took a stone, I prepared my body to take a breath and begin the walk. As I walked through the labyrinth, I imagined each hopeless thought as a stone that was weighing me down that dropped from my shoulders with every step I took. Finally, as I reached the center of the labyrinth, I placed the stone in the middle, symbolizing my own 'pilgrimage for hope'. I felt connected to the Earth.\"</p><p>As members of UConn's Collaboratory for JUST Innovation and Climate Equity, or JUSTICE, Atkinson-Palombo, Godfrey, and collaborators hope the labyrinth project also serves to highlight the Collaboratory's missions of community building and inter-disciplinary approaches to climate education. JUSTICE brings together faculty and experts from diverse disciplines spanning STEM, social sciences, and the humanities to collaborate on innovative, integrative, and justice-oriented projects and educational opportunities to address the climate crisis.</p><p>In the Fall semester, Atkinson-Palombo and Godfrey collaborated with Kathy Fischer, associate director of the UConn Women's Center, on developing and teaching a course on ecofeminism.

But some members who had already signed contract extensions called for terminating the open offer period or implementing a progressive premium structure for any member that fails to sign an extension during the period.</p><p>Ultimately, \"many board members asked IMEA staff to begin preparing a resolution for the board to vote on at its June 2025 board meeting to extend the existing contract offer until the IMEA August 21, 2025, board meeting,\" Groth wrote.</p><p>\"Whether a member city can miss the deadline and later participate beyond 2035 will have to be a future decision of the IMEA board,\" said Staci Wilson, vice president of government affairs and member services for IMEA.</p><p>A grassroots advocacy group,Clean Energy Alliance of Naperville, has mobilized citizens against the 30-year contract renewal that IMEA is seeking from all its members, including Naperville.</p><p>According to the group, the IMEA generates nearly 80% of its power through coal - 49% of it from Prairie State, and 29% from a coal-fired plant in Trimble County, Kentucky. The alliance did not respond to a request for comment by press time.</p><p>Prairie State emitted 12.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, according to theEnvironmental Law and Policy Center, a Chicago-based environmental legal advocacy group.</p><p>The plant'sstartup was rocky, with cost overruns that drove up the cost of energy for utility customers.</p><p>Since taking office, the Trump administration has issued several executive orders favoring coal-fired generation, including anApril 8 orderdeclaring coal \"essential to our national and economic security.\"</p><p>The order designates coal a mineral, which among other things means it's included in an order directing federal agencies to expedite the issuance of permits for minerals projects.</p><p>The administration has also excluded battery storage, solar and wind power fromits definition of \"energy\"and relaxed the mercury and air toxic pollution standards, which will exempt coal plants from equipment maintenance and upgrade requirements, according to theNatural Resources Defense Council.</p><p>\"What we're finding is that, for many expensive projects\" there's a wait-and-see approach, regardless of whether we're talking about fossil fuel projects or renewable projects,\" said Pamela Goodwin, co-chair of the environmental practice at Saul Ewing, a Philadelphia-based law firm with 18 offices across the U.S.</p><p>The uncertainty around federal policy is creating a legal patchwork, with local governments, utilities and developers struggling to balance state priorities with the expressed objectives of the Trump administration.</p><p>\"People are being very cautious in trying to determine what the implications are of the federal government's priorities, and how those compare and contrast to the various states in which one might be planning to develop a project,\" Goodwin said.</p><p>She said some of the new regulations coming out of the White House will allow coal facilities to continue to operate longer than they might otherwise have done.</p><p>\"What that means is that for the coal industry, we're not seeing any new coal power plants being built, and I don't anticipate that we will,\" she said. \"Investors aren't looking to reinvent their wheel with coal. The question is, can we extend the life of existing coal facilities? Many of them had already been targeted for deactivation.</p><p>\"It depends where they are in the life cycle as to whether an operator or a developer would have an interest in continuing to keep the facility going,\" she added. \"Many of them have already been scheduled for transition - for example, to gas.\"</p><p>Moody's in Januarynoted \"the significant coal exposure that IMEA has\" and the fact that it drew only 10% of its energy from renewable power in fiscal 2024.</p><p>However, Moody's pointed to IMEA's favorable take-and-pay member contracts that include a five-year termination notice, and an accelerated debt amortization profile that hastens debt repayment.</p><p>Fitch Ratingsassigns a AA-minus ratingto the planned Series 2025A issue. On April 29 it affirmed the same rating on the IMEA's $644 million of power supply revenue bonds, Series 2009C, 2010A and 2015A. The outlook is stable.</p><p>Fitch cited strong revenue defensibility due to the take-and-pay contracts, the IMEA's independent legal authority to raise rates and its largest members' strong credit quality.</p><p>The rating agency said it factored into the rating Illinois' Climate Equity and Jobs Act, which aims to significantly curb carbon emissions by 2038 and targets net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>\"Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation,\" Fitch said.</p><p>The rating agency did consider the credit quality of Naperville and St. Charles in rating the IMEA's debt. But the potential loss of Naperville would not impact the rating because the 2035 expiration of the city's contract coincides with the maturity of IMEA's outstanding debt, said Jeff Wark, a Fitch director for U.S. public finance and public power.</p><p>The refunding issuance will match the original maturities of the bonds to be refunded, Fitch said.</p><p>Wark declined to comment on the implications for coal-reliant issuers like IMEA of potential changes to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency power plant standards that require sharp reductions by 2032 in carbon emissions from coal-fired plants.</p><p>\"It's difficult to predict what changes may, or may not, come from the new administration with respect to future EPA guidelines on carbon emissions,\" he said.</p><p>S&amp;P Global Ratings affirmed its A long-term rating and underlying rating on the IMEA's revenue bonds in October 2023. The outlook is stable.</p><p>\"We do think that Naperville is one of the stronger members of IMEA, so if Naperville were to leave membership, that would likely be a credit negative from our perspective,\" S&amp;P Associate Director Tim Meernik said. \"One of the things that we'll be looking at is, Naperville is responsible for about one third of the IMEA's energy sales, so how does IMEA respond\" with its power supply portfolio?</p><p>\"Basically, it complicates their power supply planning,\" he said. The IMEA would need to rebalance its contracts if one of its largest members leaves.</p><p>\"It's a matter of matching supply and demand,\" said S&amp;P Director Jeff Panger. \"With uncertainty related to Naperville and others\" it limits the choices that the joint action agency has in being able to address their future power supply plans.</p><p>\"This is true for all joint action agencies,\" he added. \"We look to see that the debt maturities are in line with the member contracts. If you don't have people to buy your power, and you have debt coming due, that's a problem for credit. So we want to see that there's a match between power supply and demand.\"</p><p>Panger said the law that governs the emissions of Prairie State will be Illinois' CEJA, until something else is passed. \"We rate to what the law is, not the back-and-forth on this,\" he said of the debate over environmental regulations and Trump's executive orders.</p><p>\"We realize that there's a lot of fluidity right now, and we continue to monitor the changes,\" Meernik added. \"We haven't seen anything definitive to change our view that over the long term, IMEA remains exposed\" to financial and operational challenges from its reliance on coal.</p><p>Saul Ewing's Goodwin said most of the changes at the federal level have been through executive orders, and those are not really fully implemented. The question the energy industry is asking, she said, is what can get financed?</p><p>\"I suppose the right existing and not terribly old coal-fired power plant might be a candidate for interim financing to do some upgrade work and things of that nature,\" she said.</p><p>She noted that nuclear energy is generating a lot of buzz today, but those projects have long timelines. And she predicted that even with the Trump administration's orders, coal usage will decrease by about 5% in 2025, and by another 20% in total between 2025 and 2029.</p><p>\"What kind of energy operations are going to get the confidence and the backing of the major investors? I think most of that is going to go to natural gas,\" Goodwin added.</p><p>IMEA Board of Directors Chairman Cory Sheehy did not respond to requests for comment.</p>", "publisher": "The Bond Buyer", "instances": ["The outlook is stable.

If you don't have people to buy your power, and you have debt coming due, that's a problem for credit. So we want to see that there's a match between power supply and demand.\"</p><p>Panger said the law that governs the emissions of Prairie State will be Illinois' CEJA, until something else is passed. \"We rate to what the law is, not the back-and-forth on this,\" he said of the debate over environmental regulations and Trump's executive orders.</p><p>\"We realize that there's a lot of fluidity right now, and we continue to monitor the changes,\" Meernik added. \"We haven't seen anything definitive to change our view that over the long term, IMEA remains exposed\" to financial and operational challenges from its reliance on coal.</p><p>Saul Ewing's Goodwin said most of the changes at the federal level have been through executive orders, and those are not really fully implemented. The question the energy industry is asking, she said, is what can get financed?</p><p>\"I suppose the right existing and not terribly old coal-fired power plant might be a candidate for interim financing to do some upgrade work and things of that nature,\" she said.</p><p>She noted that nuclear energy is generating a lot of buzz today, but those projects have long timelines.

Instead, the House bill would support industrial agriculture practices that have no proven benefits to the climate, such as increasing price supports for industrial commodity crops.</p><p>While the chairman's proposal does include a few positive provisions--such as support for resolving the land ownership issues that especially impact Black, Indigenous and other farmers of color - these do not offset the bill's many problems. It fails to offer meaningful protection for the workers who keep the country's food and farm system running, or to consider USDA Equity Commission recommendations to address discrimination at the agency and ensure farming is accessible to all.</p><p>In addition, the bill would restrict how Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may be updated, limiting science-based changes to the Thrifty Food Plan and therefore preventing benefits from being adjusted to reflect the cost of a nutritious diet based on the latest scientific or dietary guidelines.</p><p>Representative Thompson's proposal flies in the face of clear public support for programs that make farmers more resilient, protect food and farm workers, and help people of color and young people succeed in agriculture. The chairman recently called for a 'tripartisan' farm bill--highlighting his motivation to cater to corporate agribusiness as the third party--and this proposal reflects that. New UCS research found that agribusinesses, industry groups and others have spent more than half a billion dollars over the last five years lobbying on issues that include the next food and farm bill and donated $3.4 million dollars to the campaign coffers of three key food and farm bill architects, including Thompson.</p><p>Below is a statement by Melissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs in the Food and Environment Program at UCS:</p><p>\"The House food and farm bill would eliminate critical guardrails that ensure Inflation Reduction Act conservation investments make farmers part of the climate solution. Farmers are increasingly impacted by severe droughts, extreme heat and flooding. Any final food and farm bill must include support for programs that help farmers adapt to a changing climate while also reducing agricultural emissions that are driving the climate crisis. Climate-focused conservation funding is essential to help farmers make their farms more resilient and must remain designated for this purpose.</p><p>\"The bill is out of line with what the public wants and our food system needs. People across the country strongly support programs that help farmers protect their farms from extreme weather, like those funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. They also support protecting the workers who keep our country fed and want to ensure that small-scale, diverse and young farmers have equitable access to land, credit, and other vital resources. The House bill fails in these respects.</p><p>\"The food and farm bill provides an opportunity to build a more resilient, sustainable, just and equitable food and farm system, for all of us. As it stands, this bill is unacceptable. We urge the House Agriculture Committee to reject this legislation.

Authored by Natalia Renta with research support from Meron Lemmi, and edited by Patrick Woodall, Lisa Donner, and Alex Martin, the report details how a burgeoning anti-ESG (environmental, social, governance) campaign--backed by fossil fuel and corporate interests--aims to dismantle pensions' ability to safeguard $5.3 trillion in assets for 12 million retirees and 14.9 million workers. It offers states a battle plan to counter these attacks and secure retirement funds vital to local economies.</p><p>The report frames public pensions as economic linchpins, distributing $334 billion annually and supporting 3.7 million jobs, $710 billion in output, and $86 billion in taxes. Yet, it warns of a federal onslaught expected under a new Trump administration and Republican Congress, echoing Project 2025's deregulatory blueprint and prior House bills like H.R. 5339. These moves threaten to reverse Biden-era rules allowing pensions to weigh environmental and social factors, replacing them with restrictive 2020 Trump-era limits. Anti-ESG efforts, already enacted in 17 states via 19 laws, cast doubt on considering climate risks--projected to devalue real estate by $121-$237 billion--or social factors like labor rights, despite evidence linking them to financial stability. The report cites Florida's pecuniary-only law and Montana's ESG ban as examples sowing legal confusion for fiduciaries.</p><p>State action is the antidote, AFREF argues. With pensions governed by state law, legislatures and officials can affirm their right to assess ESG risks, mirroring Biden's 2022 DOL rule, through statutes or attorney general opinions. The report highlights opportunities to reclaim pensions' shareholder voice--silenced by federal and state curbs on proxy voting--urging funds to define voting criteria on climate, equity, and labor issues. It also tackles financial deregulation risks, like weakened SEC climate disclosures, proposing state-mandated reporting akin to California's laws. In private markets, where pensions hold a third of private equity capital, states can demand transparency from advisers, drawing on derailed SEC rules for quarterly fee reports and audits.</p><p>The anti-ESG push also targets asset managers like BlackRock, managing vast pension index funds. The report notes their 22% S&amp;P 500 stake often backs short-term corporate gambles over long-term stability--exacerbated by state divestments like Florida's $2 billion BlackRock pullout. Pensions can counter this by managing funds in-house or reclaiming voting rights, while leveraging client clout to steer managers toward sustainability. States like Illinois and New Mexico exemplify DEI integration, with policies boosting diverse fund managers to enhance returns and equity.</p><p>AFREF's roadmap isn't just defense--it's a call to wield pensions' $5.3 trillion as a force for workers and communities. Facing a federal rollback of safeguards, states must act decisively, codifying ESG and DEI principles to protect retirement security and economic vitality. With $400 billion added to GDP yearly, the stakes are clear: pensions must resist being pawns in a corporate-driven agenda and instead champion a just, sustainable future.</p><p>* * # * *</p><p>Primary source of information: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roadmap-to-Protect-Public-Pensions-1.pdf\">https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Roadmap-to-Protect-Public-Pensions-1.pdf</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Casa</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Millions of workers are subjected to the dangers of extreme heat that increase their risk of heat-related illnesses and fatalities. Due to personal, social, and workplace vulnerabilities, workers are at even greater risk, particularly women, people who are Black or Brown, those who facing low-income challenges, and those employed by small businesses. With no mandated federal heat stress standard, there is no federal mechanism to ensure the adoption of appropriate heat stress prevention strategies and emergency procedures to protect vulnerable workers.</p><p>Now is an opportune time to introduce a federal program to champion climate equity and justice in the workplace by assisting employers' implementation of evidence-based heat stress management strategies and heat illness emergency procedures, particularly targeting underserved working populations who labor in the heat. This program should be supported by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), along with university and nonprofit partners, and funded through a private or public partnership. This effort will act on the principles of employer social responsibility, best practice recognition, increased resource allocation to vulnerable working groups, third-party auditing, and a non-retaliation reporting mechanism. This policy action, across multiple stakeholders, will proactively address the challenges posed by extreme heat and work toward creating safer, more equitable working environments for all.</p><p>Challenge and Opportunity</p><p>The average global surface temperature in 2023 was 2.12F above the 20th century average, resulting in Earth's warmest year on record. Extreme temperatures will continue to rise as the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves increase due to climate change. Climate change is a major public health priority that places workers who perform physical labor in the heat at higher risk, due to frequent prolonged, heavy physical exertion, layers of personal protective clothing, and exposure to environmental heat stress. This combination of factors exacerbates the level of heat stress placed on the body, leading to heat-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. While the Biden Administration has initiated federal action to establish a mandated heat standard, the bureaucratic process is slow, averaging around eight years. Congress is also working on addressing this issue through the consideration of a bill for the adoption of an emergency temporary standard. Although it offers a quicker solution, it has a limited life span of approximately six months. Moreover, in anticipation of mandating a federal heat stress standard, there is limited infrastructure to support the adoption of evidence-based heat stress management strategies to protect workers in high-temperature environments. The current enforcement solution, OSHA's National Emphasis Program on outdoor and indoor heat hazards, has several limitations, include such as a vague definition of noncompliant following heat hazard inspection, and uses assessment tools such as Heat Index, which is not considered \"best practice.\"</p><p>To address these limitations, key stakeholders from academic settings, large research institutes, and nonprofit organizations have developed evidence-based best practices to protect vulnerable workers from extreme heat. Unfortunately, there is no system in place to determine how well companies are prepared for extreme heat. The urgency of adopting evidence-based heat stress management strategies across industries cannot be overstated, as heat-related injuries and fatalities are entirely preventable with the implementation of appropriate prevention strategies and emergency procedures.</p><p>There is a critical opportunity to champion climate equity and justice to safeguard laborers from the dangers of extreme heat. Laborers from vulnerable demographics who engage in physical work in the heat are disproportionately affected and are often not protected under evidence-based heat stress management practices by their employers. Workers with personal (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, disease status) and social (e.g., employment type, income status) vulnerabilities are exploited by working in hot environments with limited heat stress prevention strategies available to them. This form of labor exploitation during periods of high heat exposure leaves millions of U.S. workers more vulnerable to preventable heat-related injuries and fatalities.</p><p>Small businesses and other companies with limited resources are also less equipped to protect their workforce or have the means to ensure their employees are working in safe environments in the heat. To fortify workplace resilience against extreme heat and climate change, it is imperative to equitably distribute resources for enforcing evidence-based heat policies in workplaces. Organizations with employees exposed to high temperatures must be held accountable for the effective implementation of these policies. Additionally, vulnerable workers frequently refrain from reporting unsafe conditions due to the fear of employer retaliation. Advocacy efforts become even more challenging as language barriers, food insecurity, and poverty exacerbate already dire working conditions.</p><p>The present moment presents an opportune time to introduce a program supported by occupational health and safety federal agencies. As evidence-based best practices have been developed to protect workers from extreme heat, there is no system in place to protect vulnerable working populations, allocate resources, and keep companies accountable by assessing their current heat stress management practices. OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are key stakeholder organizations to initiate a federal response to address the lack of adoption of heat stress management policies. However, these entities often prioritize multiple projects simultaneously, are understaffed, and benefit from partnerships with universities and nonprofits. Therefore, a cooperative approach with governing like OSHA and universities/nonprofit organizations is the appropriate strategy to create a program that promotes the enforcement of evidence-based heat protection strategies (i.e., education, hydration, heat acclimatization, environmental monitoring, physiological monitoring) at the organizational level. This approach also provides under-resourced businesses with access to basic heat protection equipment and establishes a mechanism for employees to report unsafe working conditions without fear of retaliation. This program draws inspiration from the success of the Fair Food Program, a Corporate Social Responsibility model that promotes accountability among growers, buyers, and retailers.</p><p>This comprehensive program will support all organizations that employ workers who perform physical work in the heat, such as construction, utilities, agriculture, oil, and gas. This program will facilitate employer accountability, social responsibility, increased resource allocation, third-party auditing, and a non-retaliation reporting system.</p><p>Plan of Action</p><p>The development and implementation of this federal program, the Occupational Heat Resiliency Program (OHRP), will require a public-private partnership between OSHA, universities, and nonprofit partners. This partnership model draws inspiration from the successful collaborative partnerships between OSHA and other partners to protect the workforce against other occupational hazards. The OHRP will promote the adoption of evidence-based heat stress management practices by targeting employers with workplaces that experience high heat exposure and/or have a large population of laborers working in the heat who are classified as vulnerable workers. The establishment of OHRP will require funding through cooperative agreements, such as the OSHA Strategic Partnership Program (OSPP). To achieve the program's objectives, both OSHA and its partners will commit their knowledge and resources to support the program.</p><p>The program will rely on the following principles to achieve this objective:</p><p>Employer accountability and best practice recognition:</p><p>Employers engaging with the proposed federal program will formalize their commitment to safeguarding workers from extreme heat through evidence-based practices derived from original research from research institutes and academic organizations. These original research sources have informed governing body recommendations from institutes such as NIOSH.</p><p>These commitments can be publicized, creating transparency and ensuring that products are manufactured by adequately protected workers.</p><p>The program aims to promote the adoption of evidence-based heat practices that enhance safety, health, and productivity for the U.S. workforce.</p><p>Recognition of best practices will facilitate widespread adoption, empowering employers, safety professionals, and workers to implement strategies and emergency procedures that effectively mitigate the risk of heat-related illnesses and injuries.</p><p>Climate equity through increased resource allocation:</p><p>Recognizing the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable populations, the program will allocate resources to workplaces with high percentages (&gt;50%) of at-risk workers. This includes small businesses and workplaces with a high percentage of women, people of Color, and low-income workers. Workplace needs will be performed through existing efforts related to other occupational hazards or community projects and by targeting industries associated with increased employment of vulnerable workers.</p><p>Support may include assistance in creating heat stress management educational materials and emergency action plans/procedures, implementing written heat stress management plans, and providing essential resources such as hydration, shade, and cooling products.</p><p>Safer work environments through third-party auditing and a non-retaliation reporting system:</p><p>Third-party audits, led by university or non-profit partners, will determine feasible evidence-based practices and resource allocations.</p><p>Audits will employ a tier system (I, II, II) to show the level of protection that the workplace has implemented based on the presented recommendations. To ensure compliance, a non-retaliation reporting system will allow workers to report incidences where their work environment was unsafe due to extreme heat.</p><p>A non-retaliation reporting system will be implemented to empower workers to report unsafe conditions due to extreme heat, ensuring employer compliance and accountability. This information within the report will not be shared with employers directly, but rather through the third-party auditing entity.</p><p>The program will be led by teams composed of OSHA representatives and university/nonprofit partners that will meet virtually regularly to ensure the goals of each principle are being met and to address any partnership issues that may arise.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The escalating challenges to the U.S. workforce posed by extreme heat demand proactive measures, necessitating collaboration among key government entities like OSHA alongside universities and nonprofit organizations. Currently, there is a glaring absence of mechanisms to safeguard workers who engage in physical work in the heat, particularly those from vulnerable demographics.</p><p>To tackle this issue head-on, the establishment of OHRP funded through a private or public partnership is imperative. This initiative would champion climate equity in the workplace by expediting the adoption of evidence-based heat stress management strategies and emergency procedures. The program's framework includes commitments from employers, recognition of best practices, increased resource allocation to vulnerable working groups, third-party auditing, and a non-retaliation mechanism. OHRP will have an immediate impact at both the federal and state level.

The two documents, called notices of funding opportunity, were taken down Thursday as the administration moves to end government climate programs and diversity efforts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency published them shortly before President Donald Trump took office to explain its goals and priorities for two of the nation's main disaster grant programs. The Biden administration and Congress had vastly increased funding in recent years for both programs, which pay for mitigation projects to harden infrastructure or structures against future disasters. </p><p>President Joe Biden heralded the increased funding as part of his effort to address climate change. One of the removed documents, which was obtained by POLITICO's E&amp;E News, warned about \"the growing hazards associated with climate change\" and urged \"mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation.\" The notice also prioritized using federal funding to promote \"the goal of equity\" by helping environmental justice communities - areas with vulnerable populations and high exposure to climate impacts. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said removing funding notices while state and local governments were developing applications \"is another irresponsible action of this administration.\" By publishing the notices on Jan. 6, FEMA enabled state and local governments to begin applying for the grants before the April 18 deadline. \"I am concerned that the administration will continue its unlawful actions on grants and is planning to hold $1.35 billion in mitigation grants political hostage,\" Thompson said in a statement to E&amp;E News. FEMA did not respond to requests for comment. One former senior FEMA official said it appears that the Trump administration intends to fund both programs because they are still listed on the federal grants website but without the funding notices. The notices also were pulled from FEMA's website. \"They're scratching some language having to do with climate, equity and innovation,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution. FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program was to provide $750 million in grants this year for a range of projects such as elevating flood-prone homes and building wind shelters. FEMA's Flood Mitigation Assistance program was to provide $600 million in grants this year for local flood protection. \"My hope is that it's just streamlining the language to eliminate the language that this administration doesn't like. Hopefully it'll lead to enough flexibility where states that want to help their most high-risk communities can do that,\" the former FEMA official said. The two programs have given states roughly $8 billion since 2016, an E&amp;E News analysis shows. Created through legislation Trump signed in 2018, the BRIC program under the Biden administration emphasized addressing climate change and helping environmental justice communities. The documents were removed on the same day that FEMA's acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton, posted a video on X announcing a full review of all FEMA grants and funding to nongovernmental organizations. \"Our goal is to prioritize survivors and communities impacted by the hardest hit disasters. We are doing this because we want to be responsible with our dollars and deliver them to those in need,\" Hamilton said in the 38-second video. Four FEMA officials including its chief financial officer were fired last week for processing a previously approved $59 million payment to reimburse New York City for sheltering undocumented migrants. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, reclaimed $80 million that FEMA gave the city under a special program Congress funded in 2023 and 2024.</p>", "publisher": "ClimateWire", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 109, "title": "ICYMI: ADMINISTRATOR LEE ZELDIN ANNOUNCES EPA FOUND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PARKED AT AN OUTSIDE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION BY BIDEN ADMINISTRATION", "published": "2025-02-15", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following information was released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency found $20 billion dollars parked at a financial institution by the Biden-Harris Administration to fund partisan pet projects.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Administrator Zeldin called for termination of the financial agent agreement, and for the immediate return of the entire fund balance to the United States Treasury to ensure EPA oversight.

By the way, Free Beacon just came out with a story about an hour ago where $2 billion went to Stacey Abrams' group, even though that group only received $100 in 2023. Yeah, in 2024 they got $2 billion,\u201d Zeldin said when asked what was the most egregious thing he found in the EPA that the Biden administration left behind.</p><p>Zeldin said this was done as a rushed effort by the Biden administration to disburse massive sums in the days leading up to the presidential transition.</p><p>\u201cThese eight entities are all pastor entities to sub-grantees. Many of those sub-grantees are also pastor entities. And the way this whole thing was designed, both the financial agent agreement between Treasury and the bank, the account control agreement with EPA, the bank, and the primary recipients, these were all built to tie EPA's hands behind their back and to ensure less accountability and less oversight,\u201d Zeldin added. \u201cIt was a race against time prior to Inauguration Day to get out $20 billion that the Biden EPA said, as they were caught on camera, throwing gold bars off the Titanic.\u201d</p><p>Zeldin's criticisms didn't stop at fiscal mismanagement. He said that there was a shift in the EPA's mission under his leadership, contrasting it with what he perceives as the previous administration's focus on channeling billions toward-ideologically driven groups under the guise of environmental justice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/12/radical-left-wing-activist-org-sunsetting-grant-program-biden-epa-wanted-to-fund-to-tune-of-50-million/\">(RELATED: Radical Left-Wing Activist Org Sunsetting Grant Program Biden EPA Wanted To Fund To Tune Of $50 Million)</url></emphasis></p><p>\u201cDuring the last four years, you saw this push towards spending tens of billions of dollars to left-wing ideological groups. That's in the name of environmental justice. Well, if you want to help a community that's been left behind, if you're going to spend a dollar, spend it on remediating that environmental issue in the first place rather than giving it to some left-wing activist group,\u201d Zeldin said.</p><p>\u201cI canceled a $50 million grant to the Climate Justice Alliance. They say climate justice is through a free Palestine. As far as the Trump EPA, we are prioritizing first and foremost this core mission of making sure that we have clean air, land, and water.\u201d</p><p>Last week, Zeldin <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/13/trump-epa-moves-to-claw-back-bidens-20-billion-green-slush-fund/\">announced</url> his team's efforts to regain control of funds from Biden's EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program that provided financial support to green organizations investing in technology projects, with several recipients <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/04/biden-epa-billions-grants-green-groups-democrat-ties/\">tied</url> to the Democratic Party.

Instead, the House bill would support industrial agriculture practices that have no proven benefits to the climate, such as increasing price supports for industrial commodity crops.</p><p>While the chairman's proposal does include a few positive provisionssuch as support for resolving the land ownership issues that especially impact Black, Indigenous and other farmers of color these do not offset the bill's many problems. It fails to offer meaningful protection for the workers who keep the country's food and farm system running, or to consider USDA Equity Commission recommendations to address discrimination at the agency and ensure farming is accessible to all.</p><p>In addition, the bill would restrict how Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may be updated, limiting science-based changes to the Thrifty Food Plan and therefore preventing benefits from being adjusted to reflect the cost of a nutritious diet based on the latest scientific or dietary guidelines.</p><p>Representative Thompson's proposal flies in the face of clear public support for programs that make farmers more resilient, protect food and farm workers, and help people of color and young people succeed in agriculture. The chairman recently called for a 'tripartisan' farm billhighlighting his motivation to cater to corporate agribusiness as the third partyand this proposal reflects that. New UCS research found that agribusinesses, industry groups and others have spent more than half a billion dollars over the last five years lobbying on issues that include the next food and farm bill and donated $3.4 million dollars to the campaign coffers of three key food and farm bill architects, including Thompson.</p><p>Below is a statement by Melissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs in the Food and Environment Program at UCS:</p><p>\"The House food and farm bill would eliminate critical guardrails that ensure Inflation Reduction Act conservation investments make farmers part of the climate solution. Farmers are increasingly impacted by severe droughts, extreme heat and flooding. Any final food and farm bill must include support for programs that help farmers adapt to a changing climate while also reducing agricultural emissions that are driving the climate crisis. Climate-focused conservation funding is essential to help farmers make their farms more resilient and must remain designated for this purpose.</p><p>\"The bill is out of line with what the public wants and our food system needs. People across the country strongly support programs that help farmers protect their farms from extreme weather, like those funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. They also support protecting the workers who keep our country fed and want to ensure that small-scale, diverse and young farmers have equitable access to land, credit, and other vital resources. The House bill fails in these respects.</p><p>\"The food and farm bill provides an opportunity to build a more resilient, sustainable, just and equitable food and farm system, for all of us. As it stands, this bill is unacceptable. We urge the House Agriculture Committee to reject this legislation. Congress can and must do better.\"</p>", "publisher": "States News Service", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 40, "title": "ICYMI: Administrator Zeldin: \"The Golden Age of American Success is Upon Us\"", "published": "2025-03-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Environmental Protection Agency issued the following news release on March 5, 2025:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ICYMI: Administrator Zeldin: \"The Golden Age of American Success is Upon Us\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - This week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin shared the great strides the EPA has taken to safeguard clean air, land, and water while Powering the Great American Comeback in his first month on the job. The Administrator has wasted no time identifying and eliminating waste and abuse from the agency, taking steps to unleash American energy, overseeing a record-breaking cleanup effort following the California wildfires, ending the Biden-era EV mandate, lowering consumer prices on appliances by rolling back Biden-era regulations and more. He also highlighted President Trump's leadership and vision for a stronger, more prosperous union in the President's Joint Address to Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read what Administrator Zeldin had to say in his exclusive op-ed for the National Review:</p><p>\"The golden age of American success is upon us. In just one month, the Trump administration has achieved more than most presidents accomplish in four years. It's about promises made, promises kept.</p><p>\"I was sworn in as the 17th administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency just one month ago, and we have already taken great strides to power the great American comeback. We are working tirelessly to ensure clean air, land, and water for every American, while simultaneously driving economic growth by unleashing energy dominance, pursuing permitting reform, making the United States the AI capital of the world, and bringing back American auto jobs.</p><p>\"Under President Trump's leadership, the EPA will strive to accomplish all this while fulfilling our commitment to the rule of law, advancing cooperative federalism, and being good stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.</p><p>\"In my first days, I crisscrossed the country while overseeing an unprecedented emergency response, slashed wasteful spending, and championed American energy independence -- all while restoring accountability within the agency.</p><p>\"Working with DOGE, we cancelled $171 million in wasteful DEI and environmental-justice grants and contracts, and another $1 million in media subscriptions; $50 million of this now-cancelled funding went to the Climate Justice Alliance, which believes that 'climate justice travels through a Free Palestine.' The days of shoveling millions of dollars to far-left radical organizations in the name of climate equity are over.</p><p>\"Further, my team uncovered extensive troubling developments with $20 billion in \"gold bars\" that the Biden EPA 'tossed off the Titanic.' These taxpayer funds were parked at an outside financial institution to rush out the door and circumvent proper oversight; $20 billion was given to just eight pass-through nongovernmental entities in an effort riddled with self-dealing, conflicts of interest, and an extreme lack of qualifications. The Department of Justice has been working hard to assist us so that we can remain accountable to American taxpayers.</p><p>\"In just a few short weeks, we have taken significant measures to spearhead America's return to energy dominance. We approved West Virginia's application for primacy over Class VI wells, giving the state primary authority to protect groundwater and bolstering energy dominance. I was honored to join President Trump's National Energy Dominance Council, and have taken action to lower appliance costs for everyday Americans by overhauling the Biden-era WaterSense program. I will work alongside my cross-agency counterparts to slash energy costs for families struggling to heat their homes, fill their gas tanks, and afford groceries, while reducing American dependence on foreign adversaries.</p><p>\"We also ended Covid-era remote work and proudly renamed our Gulf of America division.</p><p>\"I have also taken action regarding California's outsized heavy hand on national vehicle regulations, transmitting the Biden administration's California waiver rules to Congress -- a step that the Biden administration deliberately avoided. This had prevented members of Congress from deciding on the Biden administration's allowing California to create a separate, stricter regime of regulations that provided a different model for states to follow. Congress can now decide the fate of these waivers through the Congressional Review Act. This move protects consumer choice and vehicle affordability.</p><p>\"At President Trump's direction, the EPA executed the largest wildfire hazardous waste cleanup in agency history and finished in just 28 days -- beating the 30-day timeline set for us.</p><p>\"I am committed to understanding firsthand the environmental challenges that communities face rather than managing from behind a desk in Washington. I was honored to join Vice President JD Vance in East Palestine, Ohio, on the two-year anniversary of the tragic train derailment. I also traveled to survey wildfire damage in Los Angeles and met with affected residents. I checked in on hurricane recovery efforts in Western North Carolina and toured improved water infrastructure in Flint, Michigan.</p><p>\"In just 30 days, we have revived both the EPA's environmental mission and its commitment to American prosperity. By prioritizing results over ideology, fiscal responsibility over wasteful spending, and cooperation over confrontation, we are demonstrating that environmental protection and economic growth are complementary.</p><p>\"President Trump will deliver his joint address to Congress today. In it, he will outline his inspiring path forward for our nation. It's about promises made, promises kept as we enter the golden age of American success to achieve a stronger, more prosperous union. This is just the beginning. I look forward to four more years of winning as the EPA does its part to power the Great American Comeback.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/icymi-administrator-zeldin-golden-age-american-success-upon-us\">https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/icymi-administrator-zeldin-golden-age-american-success-upon-us</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9095059 MSTRUCK</p>", "publisher": "Targeted News Service", "instances": ["In my first days, I crisscrossed the country while overseeing an unprecedented emergency response, slashed wasteful spending, and championed American energy independence -- all while restoring accountability within the agency.

Partnering with cash-strapped state agencies, the EPA bought kits that could measure lead levels in children with just a finger prick, gave out gift cards to incentivize testing, and offered testing opportunities in offices where families picked up benefits and received breastfeeding support.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The program invested $150,000 in lead-testing kits for Harrison County, where Clarksburg is located, which raised testing rates in children from about 8% to 41%, says Camilla McMillen-Haught, director of Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) Nutrition in six West Virginia counties, including Harrison. Children with high levels of lead were then targeted for health interventions like dietary changes that would reduce their risk of long-term problems.</p><p>The future of the program is now uncertain because of the Trump Administration's focus on rooting out efforts to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental-justice initiatives. A proposed expansion of the lead-testing program to states like Ohio is also threatened.</p><p>An EPA staffer connected to the initiative was put on administrative leave in early February as part of the Trump Administration's purge of federal-government workers. An additional 167 members of the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights were put on administrative leave, according to the agency, many after receiving emails that said they were identified as spending more than half their time on environmental-justice initiatives.</p><p>These moves were part of President Trump's Executive Order, titled \"Ending Radical and Waste Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\" which he issued on his first day in office to target DEI and environmental-justice programs. (A Maryland judge on Feb. 21 largely blocked the Administration from carrying out much of the DEI Executive Order, though staff members and recipients of grants have not yet seen changes since then.) The Administration's goal, it said, was to slash spending and end initiatives that single out minorities for help.</p><p>In the directive, Trump criticized his predecessor's own Executive Order seeking to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities as \"illegal and immoral discrimination.\" New EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a video posted on X Feb. 12 that \"the days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.\" He added, on Feb. 22, \"UPDATE: I just cancelled another 21 wasteful DEI and Environmental Justice grants, with the help of our amazing @DOGE team, racking up $67m more in savings!\"</p><p>But many of the environmental-justice programs targeted by the new Administration's staff cuts and funding freezes do not benefit minorities or left-leaning environmental groups, according to Adam Ortiz, who until January served as the EPA's Regional Administrator for Region 3, which includes Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Often they help poor, white communities in conservative areas--places that overwhelmingly voted for Trump.</p><p>Clarksburg, a beneficiary of the West Virginia lead-testing program, is a former manufacturing hub that is 90% white and has a poverty rate of 23.2%, about double the national average. Harrison County, where it is located, voted for Trump by a margin of 40 percentage points in 2024.</p><p>\"These are communities that had the most hope in this Administration and are now feeling the most suffering,\" says Jacob Israel Hannah, the CEO of Coalfield Development Corporaton, a nonprofit that does workforce development in 21 counties in West Virginia. Coalfield had won nearly $700 million in federal funding for projects across the region. But nearly all that money was frozen by federal spending pauses targeting DEI, environmental justice, and clean-energy initiatives.</p><p>When asked about the idea that ending DEI and environmental-justice activities hurts communities that supported Trump, an EPA spokesperson said in a statement to TIME that it is \"working diligently\" to implement President Trump's Executive Orders. It placed the 168 Office of Environmental Justice employees on administrative leave after EPA career staffers determined that their functions \"did not relate to the agency's statutory duties,\" the statement said. The agency is \"in the process of evaluating new structure and organization to ensure we are meeting our mission of protecting human health and the environment for all Americans,\" according to the statement.</p><p>Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, wrote in an email to TIME that \"protecting the civil rights and expanding opportunities for all Americans is a key priority of the Trump Administration, which is why he took decisive actions to terminate unlawful DEI preferences.\"</p><p>One of the grants Coalfield Development Corporation won--worth around $130 million--would have created 1,000 new jobs by training unemployed coal workers to become solar installers and then to install 250 megawatts of solar on closed coal mines, says Hannah. But now, he says, when Coalfield staffers log into funding portals for the Department of Energy, the EPA, and the Department of Labor, they receive a message that their grants are \"under review\" and that they are not able to access the money they were promised. The grant applications included the term environmental justice because they would have helped underserved communities access jobs and clean power, Hannah says. If the grant goes away, \"you will see the loss of what would have been over 1,000 new jobs in Appalachia,\" Hannah says.</p><p>While some of the beneficiaries of environmental-justice projects have been low-income communities of color in cities, others are struggling white communities in Appalachia. The Biden Administration mandated that 40% of many of its climate and clean energy funds flow to \"disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.\"</p><p>\"The important thing to understand about all the grants at the EPA is that they prioritized reaching the communities most overburdened by pollution,\" says Zealan Hoover, who was until recently the Director of Implementation at the EPA, overseeing $100 billion in funding. \"In every state, there was a wide range of communities receiving funding.\" That includes rural communities in the Southeast and Gulf Coast, and places across the country that have disproportionately high energy costs, Hoover says.</p><p>Some of the programs whose funding was paused or whose federal staff were placed on administrative leave provided access to clean drinking water and functioning wastewater treatment plants, says Ortiz, the former EPA regional administrator. One project, spearheaded by a staffer now on administrative leave, sought to relocate a wastewater-treatment plant in Richwood, W.Va., that has been basically inoperable since a 2016 flood, he says.</p><p>\"Our environmental-justice work was really focused on places that historically didn't have the ability to match funds or pay loans back,\" Ortiz says. \"For the first time since the 1930s and 1940s, these communities were receiving serious investments to rebuild critical infrastructure.\"</p><p>In Pennington Gap, Va., which is located in a county where 86% of voters supported Trump in 2024, the future of a grant to demolish an asbestos-filled grocery store, issued through the EPA's Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program, is now in question.

The fight to squash the spending could expose the Trump administration to billions of dollars in damages if a court later finds its actions to be unlawful, an EPA lawyer warned as part of a series of Sunday night emails last month . In the same email chain, government lawyers acknowledged that they did not know whether criminal and civil investigations launched by the Trump administration would uncover evidence of the waste, fraud or conflicts of interest that Zeldin has publicly alleged . Their \"short-term objective\" was to block the money while those probes play out, a senior Justice Department attorney wrote in one email. The government's approach \"is believed to have significant legal vulnerabilities,\" veteran EPA attorney Jim Payne wrote to 14 career staff and political appointees at the environmental agency, the Treasury Department and the Justice Department late on the night of March 9. The emails, never before made public, offer a rare glimpse at the administration's internal qualms as EPA, DOJ and Treasury wage one of the most aggressive battles in President Donald Trump's campaign . The fight over the $20 billion stands out for one reason: The administration is seeking to pull back money that is already out the door - cash that President Joe Biden's agencies had awarded, and placed in accounts for the recipients at Citibank, before Trump took office. </p><p>EPA lawyers have asserted in court that they can terminate the grants without needing to offer any specific evidence of wrongdoing by the eight nonprofits. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule as soon as this week on whether the Trump administration can continue freezing the money, which had been meant to pay for solar power, energy efficiency upgrades and other clean-energy projects in lower-income communities. Washington-based U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has chastised EPA's handling of the case, saying the agency \"never proffered ... adequate evidence\" to support its claims of wrongdoing. Even before then, the career EPA lawyer's email warning about \"significant\" risk already offered agency leaders a red flag about their strategy, according to one legal expert who reviewed the emails for POLITICO. \"To me, this is a signal that they think this is probably a loser,\" said Gary Jonesi, who retired in January after a 39-year career in enforcement at EPA under administrations of both parties. An EPA attorney would not use that adjective \"very lightly,\" said Avi Garbow, who served as the agency's general counsel in the Obama administration. \"It is not unusual at all that for policy directives ... there is some assessment by the Office of General Counsel that it presents some legal vulnerability,\" he said. \"It is less normal, I think, to phrase it as having 'significant' legal vulnerabilities.\" Other legal experts who reviewed the emails for POLITICO called it striking that they show the administration trying to block the money before finding certain evidence of wrongdoing to back it up. In one of the March 9 emails, Matthew Galeotti, a career official who at the time was serving in the office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, shared DOJ's analysis of the situation after interagency discussions throughout the day. \"The short-term objective is to prevent disbursement of the grant funds, so that ongoing criminal and civil investigations into the program can proceed without risk that the funds will permanently disappear,\" Galeotti wrote, outlining DOJ's position. That's an unusual approach, veteran EPA official Stan Meiburg told POLITICO. \"What I take from [DOJ's] line is, they're still trying to find ways to claw back the money, and they want to give themselves as much time as possible to do fishing expeditions to find any evidence in criminal or civil investigations that might give them a plausible reason for arguing that there was fraud going on, and therefore they should do this,\" said Meiburg, who retired after 37 years at EPA only to return a few months later as acting deputy EPA administrator in the Obama administration. \"And right now they haven't got one.\" In a statement Wednesday, EPA reiterated several allegations it has made publicly about the grants in recent months, including \"serious potential conflicts of interest,\" concerns about the ability of the grant recipients to handle the funds, statements by internal watchdogs of concern about oversight of the spending, and changes made by the Biden administration to the grant agreements that Zeldin says limited EPA's oversight, a claim with which the grant recipients disagree. \"It's telling that you cling to the narrative of 'no evidence' even as EPA has directly outlined evidence regarding serious concerns about self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified grantees, and reduced agency oversight tied to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,\" the agency said. \"These aren't vague suspicions - they're the foundation for ongoing DOJ and FBI and IG investigations, and the reason the fatally designed program was terminated.\" EPA added that the emails obtained by POLITICO show government attorneys seeking to stop the grant recipients from \"increasing their efforts to access and offload these tax dollars to third parties\" after the Trump administration increased its scrutiny of the program. Such withdrawals \"would be certain to cause irreparable harm to the U.S. taxpayer amounting into the billions of dollars,\" the agency added. Payne, who is serving as EPA's acting general counsel, also issued a statement characterizing the email exchange as a typical discussion. \"On their face, the alleged emails you reference appear to involve privileged discussions and ordinary deliberations among government attorneys,\" Payne said. \"Such an exchange of views is an important part of the government's work, and an unauthorized disclosure would be highly inappropriate and have potential legal consequences.\" The Justice Department declined to comment for this story, while the White House referred questions to EPA and DOJ. The FBI referred questions to DOJ. EPA's inspector general declined to comment on the existence or status of any ongoing investigations. 'Investigations may fill that out' The emails circulated weeks after Zeldin launched his first public attacks on the $20 billion grant program Feb. 12, contending that the Biden-era EPA had \"parked\" the money at Citibank as part of a \"scheme\" to evade federal oversight. \"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\" Zeldin said, vowing to bring the money back under direct EPA control. EPA and Treasury soon pressed Citibank to freeze the grant money, while DOJ and the FBI pushed forward with a criminal probe that not enough evidence existed to justify opening a criminal investigation or freezing the Citibank accounts. Under the terms of the grants, EPA can terminate the awards under three circumstances: if a recipient isn't spending the money how it's supposed to; if it misleads EPA about its eligibility to receive the grant; or if EPA has \"credible evidence\" of criminal activity. One of the grant recipients, Climate United Fund, sued EPA over the freeze on March 8, and other spurned groups were drafting their own lawsuits. By the evening of March 9, DOJ's Galeotti warned that the clock was ticking: At midnight, less than four hours later, Citibank would have \"no basis\" to continue blocking the accounts under the Trump administration's previous requests. DOJ's recommendation was that both Treasury and EPA should each write to Citibank that evening to direct that the accounts remain frozen - a step that DOJ's analysis acknowledged could lead to more litigation. \"At some point, we will need to raise defenses, but the criminal and civil investigations may fill that out over the intervening period,\" Galeotti wrote. Participants in the email exchange included a mixture of career employees and political employees, with other staffers copied as recipients. One person who chimed in was Emil Bove, a former Trump defense attorney who is now the principal associate deputy attorney general, and who had pressed for a criminal investigation of the climate grants. Copied on the emails was Blanche, another Trump defense attorney who had been sworn in as deputy attorney general just days before. The emails show that the officials were concerned with stopping the climate grants, not with stopping any specific, evidence-based incidents of waste, fraud or abuse, government watchdog group executive Jillian Blanchard argued after reviewing the messages for POLITICO. \"It just seems to me that this is end-justifies-the-means logic, that there's no evidence that's being cited,\" said Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, a group that has criticized the grant terminations. \"It's just, 'how do we protect ourselves in this moment, while we terminate grants without evidence?'\" Once the Trump administration officials decided on a specific course of action to order Citibank to keep the funds frozen, Payne - who has worked at EPA since 2016 and before that worked in environmental enforcement at DOJ - raised some concerns. He warned that the grant recipients could file for monetary damages in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, a tribunal that has exclusive jurisdiction over monetary claims against the federal government. Payne asked DOJ to assess whether the government could prevail in that legal fight, \"to help ensure EPA senior leadership is well informed since there are potential multi-billion dollar damage claims.\" Yaakov Roth, the acting assistant attorney general for civil matters, replied that DOJ couldn't make that assessment until it knew the outcome of the investigations. \"It depends on what the investigations uncover in terms of criminal conduct or other improprieties. It also depends on whether EPA ultimately terminates the grants,\" he wrote to Payne. \"All of that will bear on our defenses and rights.\" If the courts found that EPA's withholding of the funds was unlawful, the agency could be on the hook for that money, \"and perhaps interest or related relief,\" Roth added. In an interview, Blanchard said it was \"wild\" to see the Trump administration acknowledge - and apparently dismiss - the risk of being liable for damages when Zeldin routinely says he terminated the grants to protect taxpayer money. \"It isn't about the money,\" said Blanchard. \"They're doing it, I believe, to be able to say they stopped this program, they stopped what the Biden administration wanted to do. That's the main goal, to be able to say they stopped this.\" Garbow, the former EPA general counsel, said he would have been wary of such extreme risk. \"I cannot envision a scenario, had I been the general counsel, where my office had determined there were significant, multibillion-dollar damage claims, and I had not received substantial reassurance from the Justice Department about the merits of our potential defenses - that certainly, in my experience, would have warranted a conversation directly with the administrator to ensure that he or she was comfortable proceeding this way,\" Garbow said. It is unclear to what extent Zeldin was consulted on the matter on the evening the emails were sent. Just 44 minutes passed between Payne sharing the draft order to freeze the funds and Zeldin's chief of staff, Eric Amidon, sending it to Citibank. Waiting on the courts EPA's strategy to kill the climate grants has already fallen flat before one judge. Last week, Chutkan - a Barack Obama nominee who previously drew Trump's wrath while overseeing his now-dismissed election conspiracy criminal case - found that EPA's March 11 termination violated the law, the Constitution and the agency's own procedures. EPA's primary defense is that the grant terminations are effectively a breach of contract, which under the law would have to be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, not in Chutkan's courtroom. It would likely take a year or more for the climate groups to push their case in that venue, and in the meantime they would go without any of that funding, said Blanchard. The recipients have already warned that without access to the money, some will soon face layoffs and others could shut down. Chutkan rejected EPA's interpretation of the law , writing that this is no simple contract dispute and \"the government is not just another contracting party.\" And on the merits, the Justice Department has conceded that the government did not cut off the grants because of any of the recipients' actions. \"EPA did not terminate for Plaintiffs' noncompliance,\" the agency wrote in a brief in late March . Chutkan's order to reopen the taps has been temporarily stayed while EPA appeals to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least $625 million in requests from the recipients is already pending, mostly earmarked to pay for clean energy projects, housing and community lending. Even if EPA prevails in moving the dispute to the Court of Federal Claims, it could still find itself potentially liable for paying the $20 billion, Payne wrote in one email on March 9. In the email, the EPA attorney shared a draft copy of a directive that Amidon would send directing Citibank to maintain the funding freeze. But that approach, Payne reiterated, \"is believed to have significant legal vulnerabilities including for potential future substantial monetary damage claims before the Court of Federal Claims.\" Adding the word \"significant\" is a subtle but clear message to other lawyers, Jonesi - the former EPA enforcement official - told POLITICO after reading the emails. \"When you've got Trump's criminal defense lawyers, now senior people at the Justice Department, on this email chain, you choose your words carefully, and you don't want to lose credibility by overstating the case,\" he said. Jonesi is now the executive director of CREEDemocracy, a group he founded this year to promote clean energy development and scrutinize Trump's policies. At 12:28 a.m. on Monday, March 10, Amidon sent the order to Citibank to continue freezing the funds, according to documents shared in court. He made only minor tweaks to Payne's draft language. Bove, the principal associate deputy attorney general, expressed happiness with the outcome. \"Grateful to all involved for the coordination on this,\" he wrote at 1:41 a.m. \"Thanks very much.\" The agency had contemplated going further by terminating the grants, not just freezing them, but that step \"is not being effectuated at this time,\" Roth wrote the night of March 9. Amidon's order to Citibank said the agency was waiting to alter the program until it received responses to oversight questions it had sent to the recipients, which were due March 28. Instead, EPA told Climate United and the other recipients on March 11 that Zeldin has terminated their grants. The email exchange does not reveal any reasons for the abrupt change of strategy. Myron Ebell, a longtime critic of climate spending and regulation who led Trump's 2017 EPA transition team, said he supports the administration being \"ambitious\" in canceling funding such as the $20 billion Biden program, and said he doesn't fear a court overturning the grant terminations. \"Then we'll be where we are now. I don't see that that's a loss,\" he said. \"We'll go back to the status quo, and if the administration wants to end these various green grant programs, they will have to go to Congress and say 'Well, we tried to do it.'\"</p>", "publisher": "ClimateWire", "instances": ["'Investigations may fill that out' The emails circulated weeks after Zeldin launched his first public attacks on the $20 billion grant program Feb. 12, contending that the Biden-era EPA had \"parked\" the money at Citibank as part of a \"scheme\" to evade federal oversight.

In the weeks and months that followed, the allegation was not confirmed. It seemed the story was at a dead end.</p><p>Evidence Emerges of a Wild Spending Spree</p><p>That changed on February 12, 2024. The new EPA administrator, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-zeldin-epa-climate-change-9f0def092a907deb5209c2b9ac14a81d\">Lee Zeldin</url>, confirmed in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/MxkzQn8S5p0\">video announcement</url> that the EPA rushed large amounts of cash out the door in the Biden-Harris administration's waning days.</p><p>Here's a transcript of the portion of the video directly addressing the allegation:</p><p>One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse.</p><p>An extremely disturbing video circulated two months ago featuring a Biden EPA political appointee talking about how they were \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d, rushing to get billions of your tax out the door before Inauguration Day. The \u201cgold bars\u201d were tax dollars and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden Administration knew they were wasting it.</p><p>Following this revelation, during my meetings with members of Congress, I made a very important commitment to them and to the American people, which I reiterated at my confirmation hearing that if confirmed, I would immediately get a full accounting.</p><p>Fortunately, my awesome team at EPA has found the gold bars. Shockingly, roughly 20 billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA.</p><p>This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight.</p><p>Even further, this pot of $20 billion was awarded to just eight entities that were then responsible for doling out your money to NGOs and others at their discretion with far less transparency. Just under $7 billion was sent to one entity called the Climate United Fund.</p><p>I'm sure you and I now have some of the same questions.</p><p>- How do these organizations decide how to allocate funding?<br/>- How much money have they given out so far and to whom?<br/>- Are there any former Biden EPA staff offers who are now working at these entities?</p><p>Let me make one thing abundantly clear. At this point there is zero reason to suspect any wrongdoing by the bank.</p><p>Here's my position as EPA administrator. The financial agent agreement with the bank needs to be instantly terminated and the bank must immediately return all of the gold bars that the Biden Administration tossed off the Titanic.</p><p>EPA needs to reassume responsibility for all of these funds. We will review every penny that has gone out the door. I will be referring this matter to the Inspector General's office and will work with the Justice Department as well.</p><p>The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.</p><p>The American public deserves a more transparent and accountable government than what transpired these past four years. We take our obligations under the law as seriously as it gets.</p><p>I've directed my team to find your gold bars and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.</p><p>To get so much money out the door so quickly, Biden-Harris EPA officials circumvented safeguards intended to prevent government officials from wasting taxpayer money. They were indeed\u201cthrowing gold bars\u201d off their \u201csinking Titanic.\u201d Their actions to short-cut these spending controls gave them away.</p><p>Potential Criminal Dimensions</p><p>In addition to circumventing the EPA's accounting controls, the officials and bureaucrats may alsohave tripped over other laws restricting government employees from exploiting their positions for personal gain.</p><p>For example, if any officials improperly moved taxpayer funds to groups where they later got jobs after leaving public service, that feather-nesting could represent a kind of embezzlement or racketeering. The Justice Department <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2025/02/14/epa-banking-on-a-fight-over-gold-bars-00204384\">will very likely investigate that potential</url>.</p><p>I suppose the most amazing part about the story is the original claim made by the Biden-Harris special adviser to the EPA. Their brazenness following their election loss suggests they didn't think they would ever face any consequences for their actions. It's a remarkable dimension in the annals of bureaucrats behaving badly.</p><p> - This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.independent.org/2025/02/20/bureaucrats-tossing-gold-bars-off-the-titanic/\">published at The Beacon</url><br/></p>", "publisher": "Eurasia Review", "instances": ["We will review every penny that has gone out the door.

In mid-July, after receiving more than 800 public comments on the draft plan, the Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to pass a strong 10-year Climate Equity Plan that centers dignified, good-paying jobs, green workforce development in communities of color, support for universal weatherization and electrification upgrades, infrastructure improvements, future solution planning, and the staffing needed to oversee, direct, implement, and conduct community engagement for these programs.", "\"We look forward as a coalition to reviewing the budget details, and to continue to partner on ramping up the funding necessary to implement the new Climate Equity Plan. In the meantime, we celebrate the fact that the Mayor and City Council heard the community and announced a budget to support this historic step forward for climate and equity. Residents from all thirteen wards in the city, supported by the coalition, have been gathering since 2021 to strategize around raising the funds necessary to not only build out climate solutions but ensure that the benefits of the clean energy transition are available to every Minneapolis resident -- no exceptions. Dubbed the People's Climate &amp; Equity campaign, coalition members and residents have come together to work with city council members and the mayor on a climate plan grounded in an equitable transition to a clean energy economy."]}, {"relevance_score": 27, "title": "FOOD AND FARM BILL PROPOSALS MUST PRIORITIZE CLIMATE, EQUITY FOR FARMERS AND WORKERS", "published": "2024-05-01", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following information was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS):</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Statement by Melissa Kaplan, Union of Concerned Scientists</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, U.S. Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and House Committee on Agriculture Chairman Glenn \"GT\" Thompson (R-Pa.) released competing proposals for the 2024 food and farm bill. This legislation shapes the U.S. food system and covers everything from nutrition to conservation and crop insurance. The last food and farm bill expired in September 2023, and Congress passed a one-year extension shortly after to keep agricultural programs running until a new bill is signed into law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Rural Prosperity and Food Security Act, proposed but not yet introduced in full by Stabenow, critically protects climate-friendly guardrails around billions of dollars in investments from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that are intended to support farmers in being part of the climate solution. Thompson's proposal suggests removing those guardrails to allow funding to be used for practices with no demonstrated climate benefits.</p><p>A truly sustainable agricultural system must include sustainable working conditions. A review of Stabenow's proposal indicates that her bill would improve coordination across the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for food and farmworkers by reauthorizing and expanding the Farmworker Coordinator position and providing workers with support to withstand disruptions to the food and farm economy, whether from extreme weather or global pandemics.</p><p>The proposal also includes provisions to create a more just and equitable food and farm system by increasing support for farmers who have been historically underserved or excluded from USDA support and services namely Black farmers and ranchers, Indigenous producers and other farmers of color and ensuring that all farmers, no matter their background, can compete and succeed. Thompson's House proposal does not appear to contain any provisions to address the needs of workers or historically underserved farmers.</p><p>Finally, the Senate proposal would protect modernization of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to ensure that food assistance reflects the true cost of a nutritious diet based on the latest scientific and dietary guidelines.</p><p>Below is a statement by Melissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs in the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists:</p><p>\"Farmers are increasingly impacted by extreme weather driven by climate change, and any final food and farm bill must help farmers become more resilient to climate impacts like increasingly severe droughts, extreme heat and flooding while also reducing agricultural emissions that are contributing to the climate crisis. Protecting and preserving Inflation Reduction Act conservation funding for climate-smart farming practices is critical and should not be up for discussion or negotiation. This isn't a fringe issue polls show that the public strongly supports programs that help farmers protect their farms from extreme weather, like those funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>\"The public also supports protecting the workers who keep our country fed and helping people of color and young people succeed in agriculture. Senator Stabenow's proposal takes important steps to rectify a history of exclusion and discrimination by addressing the unique barriers faced by historically underserved farmers and ranchers and finally recognizing food and farmworkers as a critical part of our agriculture and food system. Workers have been clear that they deserve a voice in the food and farm bill and in USDA policies that affect their workplaces and their lives.</p><p>\"A new food and farm bill provides an opportunity to create a food system that is more resilient in the face of extreme weather and climate change, is more sustainable for future generations, is more just and equitable for farmers and workers, and keeps people from going hungry. The Rural Prosperity and Food Security Act appears to demonstrate a serious understanding and reckoning with the challenges facing our food and farm system, and the changes necessary to build a more sustainable, resilient and equitable food system that works for everyone. This proposal should be the starting point for all future conversations about the food and farm bill.\"</p>", "publisher": "States News Service", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 46, "title": "Climate grant recipient to start spending $2B as Trump's EPA tries to claw it back", "published": "2025-02-25", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Zack Colman A coalition of nonprofits under fire from President Donald Trump's appointees says it will begin doling out money from a $2 billion climate grant it received during the Biden era - despite the Environmental Protection Agency's attempts to claw back the funds. \"When the EPA made a grant to us and grants to other awardees, there's an official contract that the government enters into,\" said Tim Mayopoulos, the CEO of Power Forward Communities, in an interview with POLITICO. \"The agreement has not been terminated, and we have an obligation to fulfill it.\" He said his group, an umbrella for five nonprofits that include United Way and Habitat for Humanity, will deploy its initial $539 million disbursement from the grant over the coming weeks and months to help communities across the country build energy-efficient housing. Asked for comment on the status of the fund, EPA referred POLITICO to a videotaped statement Feb. </p><p>12 in which Administrator Lee Zeldin demanded that a total of $20 billion in Biden-era green grants be returned - vowing, \"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.\" Power Forward, one of eight recipients across two grant programs totaling $20 billion, has found itself swept up in the growing political storm surrounding Zeldin's attempts to revoke the awards - part of the Trump administration's wider effort to expand its constitutional powers by throttling already-enacted spending it disagrees with. Congress approved the $20 billion as part of a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund created by former President Joe Biden's 2022 climate law, and Biden's EPA contractually obligated the money before last October, as the statute required. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund also includes another $7 billion for solar grants. The Trump administration's efforts to revoke the climate cash have kicked off a spiraling mess that shows no signs of ending. A senior federal prosecutor resigned last week after saying Justice Department officials had pressured her to launch a criminal investigation into the green grant program despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Zeldin has taken the unorthodox step of trying to get Citibank, where Biden's administration had deposited $20 billion of the funds, to send it back. Zeldin has condemned the grants as an example of \"waste and abuse,\" though without specifying what aspects of the spending he considers wasteful or abusive. \"I'm a little perplexed that this is at all controversial,\" Mayopoulos - a former CEO of Fannie Mae - told POLITICO. \"We are in violent agreement with the president that the cost of housing and the cost of energy is too high for many Americans, and we are looking to address that issue.\" Zeldin has also attempted to lay the dispute at the feet of former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams - even referring to Mayopoulos' group as \"Stacey Abram's Power Forward Communities\" in an EPA press release last week \" of Biden. But Mayopoulos said Abrams, a former paid adviser to one of Power Forward's member groups, is no longer involved with his organization. \"Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant. It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant,\" Mayopoulos said in the interview. \"Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she's one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.\" That coalition member, Rewiring America, confirmed to POLITICO that Abrams' contract with the group expired at the end of 2024. Abrams never received any payments from or held a position with Power Forward Communities, nor did she get any money from the EPA grant, Abrams spokesperson Joshua Karp said. In her advisory role with Rewiring America, Abrams did work to identify potential partners for the coalition now working on the grant, Karp said. Abrams alluded to that role in a post on X in October 2023 , writing: \"Thrilled to be part of @rewiringamerica and the Power Forward Communities coalition. This is how we expand access to clean energy - by prioritizing housing, equity and resilience.\" In his attacks on the grant, Zeldin has repeatedly pointed to an undercover video recording that Power Forward and seven other recipients would get the money for projects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mayopoulos said the money that Power Forward is spending would support energy efficiency upgrades, build homes and boost lending capital for rural, affordable and multifamily housing. Zeldin has expressed doubts about Power Forward's selection to oversee the $2 billion grant, noting that the organization had formed only in 2023 and had revenues of just $100, according to federal tax filings. The EPA chief told Fox News on Sunday that the Justice Department \"has been asking a lot of questions of us\" and that Citibank is cooperating with the department. Though he has not cited any evidence of illegal behavior, he said that \"the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal.\" Citibank declined to comment. Mayopoulos said those accusations misrepresent his organization, which intends to improve or build 11,000 multifamily and 61,000 single-family homes, spur 64,000 jobs and curb energy bills $1.26 billion over the seven-year grant period. The coalition's member groups have long histories of rolling out major spending projects, Mayopoulos added. Together they have combined for $100 billion in projects across 1.4 million affordable homes, Power Forward Communities said. \"Power Forward Communities was created to serve as the coalition entity for these five respected nonprofits,\" Mayopoulos said. \"They clearly have the experience and capabilities and proven track record over two-and-a-half centuries of collective work to do this and to fulfill this grant.\" Besides United Way and Habitat for Humanity, Power Forward's members include the affordable housing group Enterprise Community Partners. The other partners are the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which specializes in financing projects in areas that struggle to attract private-sector investment, and Rewiring America, which aims to electrify homes and curb fossil fuel use. Program supporters have worried the Trump administration's threats to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could create a chilling effect on spending the money . But Mayopoulos said he is \"confident\" that Citibank will honor the agreements it has with the Treasury Department and the EPA, calling it a \"large and highly respected financial institution.\" Mayopoulos argued that the money will help achieve Trump's goals of reducing energy costs. The awards that Power Forward announced Monday include $115 million for rural Americans - who largely backed Trump - in states such as West Virginia and Alabama, with much of that used to finance new multifamily housing. Two other awards would boost multifamily lending by $424 million across 20 states, including Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Texas and Florida.</p>", "publisher": "ClimateWire", "instances": ["He said his group, an umbrella for five nonprofits that include United Way and Habitat for Humanity, will deploy its initial $539 million disbursement from the grant over the coming weeks and months to help communities across the country build energy-efficient housing.

AHSAN IQBAL TRIUMPHS AT OXFORD UNION DEBATE, SECURING 180 VOTES AGAINST 145 IN A HISTORIC WIN FOR THE GLOBAL SOUTH OXFORD, UK: JANUARY 31, 2025", "published": "2025-01-31", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following information was released by the Government of Pakistan:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a historic debate at the prestigious Oxford Union, Pakistan's Federal Minister for Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives, Prof. Ahsan Iqbal, emerged as a leading voice for the Global South, challenging the structural inequities embedded within liberal democracy. Invited by the President of the Oxford Union, Israr Kakar, Minister Iqbal passionately articulated how liberal democracy has failed the developing world, exposing the double standards and systemic oppression that continue to hinder economic justice, political sovereignty, and climate equity for nations of the Global South. At the heart of Minister Iqbal's argument was the assertion that liberal democracy, though championed as the ultimate model of governance, has in reality deepened inequality, fostered political instability, and reinforced economic subjugation rather than delivering on its promises of justice, prosperity, and equality. </p><p>He challenged the hypocrisy of Western democracies that preach democratic values while enabling authoritarian regimes, political suppression, and economic exploitation in the developing world. Minister Iqbal underscored the plight of occupied Kashmir and Palestine, calling for the world to recognize their inalienable right to freedom and self-determination. He criticized how liberal democracy is selectively applied, where human rights violations and war crimes in Palestine, Kashmir, and Gaza are met with silence from the very nations that claim to be champions of democracy and human rights. He questioned how powerful nations defend their allies' oppression while condemning resistance from the oppresseda contradiction that exposes the inherent bias within the system. He further argued that post-World War II global institutions were never designed to empower the Global South but rather to control it through economic dependency and geopolitical manipulation. Citing the collapse of the USSR as an event that was wrongly celebrated as a victory for liberal democracy, he pointed out that three decades later, the Global South remains entrapped in poverty, political suppression, and economic servitudea direct result of rigged financial structures, trade barriers, and debt traps imposed by the Global North. Citing Jason Heichel's book The Divide, Minister Iqbal revealed a stark reality: for every $1 in aid received by the Global South, it loses $14 through exploitative financial mechanisms such as debt repayment and profit repatriation. He called out the injustice of intellectual property laws, which enabled the West to monopolize COVID-19 vaccines, leading to 1.3 million preventable deaths in the Global South, as critical medical patents were blocked in the name of corporate profits. Highlighting the climate injustice perpetuated by liberal democracies, Minister Iqbal reminded the audience that while the Global North contributes over 80% of historical carbon emissions, it is the Global South that pays the highest price. He pointed to Pakistan's 2022 climate catastrophe, where devastating floods caused $30 billion in damages, yet the so-called champions of democracy offered loans instead of grants, effectively forcing Pakistan to finance its own destruction. He expressed dismay at the harsh reality where the promises of sustainable development have led to floods, droughts, and broken commitments, leaving developing nations to struggle while powerful states continue their exploitation unchecked. Minister Iqbal's compelling arguments resonated deeply within the intellectually rigorous environment of Oxford Union, where global leaders, scholars, and students have long engaged in some of the world's most significant debates. Despite the historically challenging nature of Oxford's debating forums, where even seasoned political figures struggle to gain consensus, Prof. Ahsan Iqbal convincingly dismantled the illusions of liberal democracy and won the debate on intellectual merit and evidence-based argumentation. The debate concluded with Prof. Iqbal's stance gaining 180 votes in favor, while the opposition secured 145 votes, marking a remarkable victory for Pakistan and the Global South on an international platform. Prof. Ahsan Iqbal's success at Oxford Union has reinforced his global reputation as a champion of underdeveloped nations, advocating for an equitable world order where the sovereignty, dignity, and development of the Global South are prioritized. His impassioned call for reform, justice, and self-reliance has resonated beyond this debate, sparking conversations in policy circles, universities, and international forums about the urgent need to redesign global governance structures for a more just, inclusive, and balanced world. As a statesman who has consistently defended democracy, justice, and equality for Pakistan and the Global South, Minister Ahsan Iqbal has once again proved that his voice is one of the few that can challenge global injustices at the highest intellectual and diplomatic levels. His triumph at Oxford Union is not just a win in a debateit is a victory for the Global South and all those striving for a fairer world. *****</p><p>PREVIOUS NEXT</p><p>ABOUT US</p><p>Press Information Department is the principal department of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, headed by Principal Information officer (PIO).

Speaking at a panel titled \"The New Economic Revolution: An African Perspective\" on February 11, 2025, he cited striking data that turns conventional wisdom on its head.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We actually asked Moody's Analytics to look at the risk profile of Africa, of investments and infrastructure over the last 14 years. Guess what they found? The rate of loss in Africa is 1.7%. That in Latin America was about 13%. The one in Eastern Europe was more about 10%.\"</p><p>These statistics paint a picture starkly different from the risk premiums typically demanded for African investments. The continent's actual performance suggests it might be one of the world's safest investment destinations--a reality masked by persistent negative stereotypes.</p><p>Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation and chairman of multiple African businesses, spoke from direct experience: \"There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa.\" Elumelu, whose portfolio spans power, oil and gas, financial services, and healthcare across four continents, including investments in the Gulf states.</p><p>He emphasized that success lies in seeing opportunity where others see risk.</p><p>\"There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa,\" said Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.</p><p>\"You may decide to see risks or challenges, or you may see opportunities,\" Elumelu explained. \"But ability to identify opportunities and structure your approach in a way that addresses and mitigates those risks confers extra competitive advantage on you and your business.\"</p><p>To bridge this perception gap, the African Development Bank Group announced plans to establish a new Africa Investment Guarantee Agency. The institution will offer comprehensive coverage against climate, equity, political, and currency risks--addressing key concerns that have historically deterred international investors.</p><p>The timing could not be more critical. Africa stands at the nexus of several global transitions: demographic, energy, and agricultural. With 75% of its population under 35 years old, including 600 million people between ages 15 and 35, the continent is positioned to become the world's workforce. Its vast mineral resources--including critical materials for electric vehicles and renewable energy--make it indispensable to the global energy transition.</p><p>\"Whether it is lithium-ion batteries, whether it is electric vehicles, whether it's platinum, whether it's copper, whether it's graphite, whether it's any of this lithium-ion, all is in Africa,\" Adesina noted. \"So what Africa actually does with its resources will shape the future of the world.\"</p><p>The narrative of a \"resource curse\" that has long haunted Africa's development story also came under scrutiny at the summit. Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh rejected this framing entirely, introducing instead the concept of \"conscientious concessions\".</p><p>These, he explained, are deals that benefit investors, governments, and local communities alike.</p><p>\"It's so easy to speak about concessions from any one of these countries or from private sector that is 100 years, lots of waivers, employees coming from abroad, everything gets shipped out. That's not consensual. You're talking about bad deals, by the way, which turned things into a curse, and I think that's what people talk about,\" Sengeh explained. He pointed to recent developments in Sierra Leone's rutile mining sector, where domestic ownership is changing the dynamics of resource management.</p><p>The narrative of a \"resource curse\" that has long haunted Africa's development is wrong, said Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh.</p><p>\"If we think about not just pennies, but the people and the planet, then the deals and the agreements we sign, with our conscience, will work for the people, will bring economic value for everyone, for the investor, for the government, and the people who are there,\" Sengeh added.</p><p>The African Development Bank Group is actively working to facilitate such balanced agreements. \"We have the African Legal Support Facility at the African Development Bank to help Sierra Leone and DRC, several other countries, to be able to structure deals that are in their own interest,\" Adesina explained.</p><p>The Africa Investment Forum Market Days held in Morocco in December 2024 demonstrated strong investor appetite when barriers are removed, securing $29.4 billion in investment interest within just 72 hours! This contributed to over $225 billion in investment interests mobilized since the Africa Investment Forum's inception in 2018. This success is part of a broader push to industrialize the continent and move beyond raw commodity exports.</p><p>\"The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,\" Adesina emphasized. \"But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.\"</p><p>Major initiatives are already underway to build this infrastructure. The African Development Bank Group is investing $3 billion in special agro-industrial processing zones, while \"Mission 300,\" a partnership with the World Bank, aims to provide electricity access to 300 million Africans. These projects represent significant opportunities for private investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution.</p><p>\"The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,\" said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President and Chair of the Boards, African Development Bank Group. \"But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.\"</p><p>The African Continental Free Trade Area, with its $3.4 trillion market potential and population of nearly 1.5 billion people, adds another layer of opportunity. \"Africa is not going to beg its way into development,\" Adesina insisted. \"Africa is going to trade and invest its way into development.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, African leaders are clear about who will drive this transformation. As Sierra Leone's Chief Minister Sengeh put it: \"Who's going to dominate in Africa? Africans are going to dominate in Africa.\" He called for \"progressive, social, democratic radicalism\" to ensure development benefits all Africans.</p><p>For global investors, the message from Dubai was clear: the risk is not in investing in Africa, but in missing out on its opportunities.

Democrats play hardball</emphasis></p><p>Senate Democrats are digging in for a fight on a House-passed stopgap funding measure that is needed by Friday night to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p>After a closed-door caucus lunch, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., announced that Democrats would fight for a one-month continuing resolution that would allow time for Congress to finish full-year appropriations bills.</p><p>The House GOP's continuing resolution (HR 1968), which passed on a mostly party-line vote Tuesday, would extend current funding through the end of this fiscal year, which is Sept. 30. Schumer suggested his caucus won't provide the votes to get to the needed 60 to allow the measure to come to a final vote, raising the odds of a shutdown when current stopgap funding (PL 118-158) runs out Friday at midnight.</p><p>\"Our caucus is unified on a clean, April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"We should vote on that.\"</p><p>That demand erects a roadblock to swift Senate passage of the House bill. But it doesn't necessarily mean the House bill is dead.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., took the initial step needed to get onto the stopgap measure Wednesday night, filing cloture on the motion to proceed to the House-passed bill. But how quickly the bill gets to the president's desk -- if at all -- was in Democrats' hands. </p><p>Democrats have been torn over whether to vote for a House bill they dislike or trigger the shutdown, which some dislike even more. If Senate GOP leaders grant Democrats a vote on a one-month CR, which likely would fall short, some Democrats may then be willing to join Republicans in advancing the House bill. Thune said he was open to that idea, though Democrats hadn't approached him yet with an offer. Your Budget Tracker has the full story here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2. Greater defense boost eyed</emphasis></p><p>As the Pentagon faces down the possibility of its first-ever yearlong stopgap funding bill, Senate GOP defense hawks are pushing to further boost military spending through a different avenue: the forthcoming reconciliation plan. </p><p>Rather than sticking to the $150 billion figure for defense spending offered in the Senate's budget resolution (S Con Res 7), lawmakers on Wednesday began publicly advocating for an extra $25 billion increase for the department through the legislation. </p><p>Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said in a brief interview Wednesday that he now wants to see \"at least $175 billion\" for the Defense Department included in the legislation. \"I could justify every penny of it,\" he added. </p><p>The comments came a day after the House narrowly passed a stopgap spending measure for the remainder of the fiscal year (HR 1968) and promptly adjourned ahead of a Friday night funding deadline. National security-minded lawmakers have chafed against the continuing resolution, which represents an effective cut to fiscal 2025 Defense funding after inflation, despite the inclusion of money transfer authorities, the ability to begin new programs and other flexibilities that are typically excluded from short-term spending plans. </p><p>The reconciliation package, as well as future fiscal 2026 defense funding legislation, is seen as a way to make up for that military spending reduction. John M. Donnelly has more details here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Related:</emphasis> Pentagon leaders plan to roll out their recommended cuts to military spending alongside their budget request for fiscal 2026, the Defense Department indicated in a newly released letter to Congress. The letter, addressed to House Armed Services Chair Mike D. Rogers, R-Ala., and dated March 5, states that Congress will be informed of the results of the so-called budget relook -- which called for an internal realignment of 8 percent of the Defense Department's budget -- as the president's spending request is made public in the coming weeks.

DOGE data access probe blocked</emphasis></p><p>House Ways and Means Republicans effectively blocked further consideration of a pair of resolutions that would require the Trump administration to share information about the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency's access to Treasury Department and Social Security Administration data.</p><p>In a rowdy committee markup Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans traded barbs about DOGE's mission and access to sensitive information at both agencies.</p><p>Democrats introduced the pair of resolutions of inquiry, which are privileged under House rules and must be considered in committee. The party-line votes to report the two resolutions of inquiry unfavorably to the House effectively block Democrats from forcing a floor vote on the measures in the future. </p><p>\"What we have seen over the last seven weeks is unacceptable,\" said Ways and Means ranking Democrat Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts. \"Unaccountable and unelected people with no experience in the systems of our government have been rifling through the people's data,\" </p><p>Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., countered that Democrats oppose cutting \"government fat.\" DOGE's access to Treasury and SSA data is above board, Smith added, citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's authorization. Caitlin Reilly has the story.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">4. EPA grants terminated</emphasis></p><p>In a late-night decision Tuesday, EPA Adminstrator Lee Zeldin terminated $20 billion in climate-change grants issued by the previous administration through the Democrats' 2022 climate reconciliation law (PL 117-169).</p><p>The grants were issued through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is intended to help finance projects across the country that would reduce emissions.</p><p>\"I have taken action to terminate these grants riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending,\" Zeldin said in a statement. \"EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars dedicated to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of 'climate equity.'\" He said the contracts were terminated due to \"incidents of misconduct, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud.\"</p><p>Zeldin has said he's referred the matter to the EPA's inspector general and that there is a parallel investigation at the Justice Department. The funds, which were placed in a Citibank account by the Biden administration, were frozen in February.</p><p>One of the recipients, Climate United, sued the EPA on March 8 over this move, arguing the agency had not adequately demonstrated that there was waste or fraud that warranted terminating the contract. A hearing on that case is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. David Jordan has more on the grants here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">5. Plan to dump federal office buildings contested</emphasis></p><p>A Trump administration plan to sell off \"non-core\" federal buildings could save hundreds of millions in annual operating costs, according to a General Services Administration estimate. But it could also displace dozens of congressional offices around the country, cost taxpayers additional money and disrupt constituent services, say critics on Capitol Hill.</p><p>As many as 43 Senate state offices and 14 House district offices are housed in buildings deemed \"non-core\" in a list that GSA published online last week and then deleted, per a count by Democratic lawmakers. And more could be at risk as part of a push to terminate federal leases to cut spending, led by billionaire Elon Musk and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>\"Picking major pieces of real estate to sell without any deeper analysis of market conditions, other office space and the long-term development plans in the region is just plain dumb,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \"That's what makes this feel like it's a whole lot more about politics than it is about government efficiency.\"</p><p>Warren has an office in the John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Boston, which appeared on the list of more than 440 properties posted last Tuesday. A day later, that original list had disappeared, though an updated roster of disposable federal buildings is \"coming soon,\" according to GSA's website. </p><p>Many federal buildings have become \"functionally obsolete and unsuitable for use,\" according to the GSA, which touted $430 million in potential yearly savings via divestiture. A spokesperson said GSA had \"received an overwhelming amount of interest\" in the effort since last week. Justin Papp has more details.</p><h>BUDGET BRIEFS</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Frozen transportation funds probed:</emphasis> Senate and House Transportation-HUD Appropriations ranking members Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. and James E. Clyburn, D-S.C., sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy asking him to explain recent funding, policy and staffing changes at the department. Gillibrand and Clyburn wrote that $60 billion in competitive grants that were awarded but not obligated have been frozen and that hundreds of probationary Transportation Department employees have been fired. -- <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aidan Quigley</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Senate GOP tax writers head to White House:</emphasis> Senate Finance Republicans head to the White House Thursday as the GOP tries to sort out its plans for a budget reconciliation bill they need to bypass a filibuster and enact much of Trump's agenda. Senate Republicans have said the $4.5 trillion cap the House budget resolution (H Con Res 14) would place on the cost of the tax portion of the bill falls short of the space they need to make the 2017 tax cuts (PL 115-97) permanent, an aim they share with the White House. House Republicans have warned major changes to their resolution would imperil the measure when it returns to their chamber.  --<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Caitlin Reilly</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Senate GOP tax cut wish list:</emphasis> Ahead of the White House meeting, Senate Finance Chairman Michael D. Crapo, R-Idaho, ticked off a list of possible tax items that could push the price tag well north of $5 trillion, significantly more than the House budget allows for. He said at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce tax summit Wednesday that senators had submitted more than 200 requests to him beyond the typical suite of 2017 tax cut extensions, relief from the state and local tax deduction cap and Trump's proposals to exempt tips and overtime pay from the income tax. Ideas range from expanded low-income housing credits to a larger estate tax exemption, Crapo said. \"The list goes on and on,\" he said, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bishop nomination advanced:</emphasis> The Senate Budget Committee approved the nomination of former Rep. Dan Bishop as deputy director of the White House budget office Wednesday, setting it up for a confirmation vote on the Senate floor.

The vote follows action by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which approved's Bishop nomination last month, as Paul M. Krawzak reports here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Medicare, Medicaid payment models scrapped:</emphasis> The Trump administration announced Wednesday it will end several payment models that were intended to save money in Medicare and Medicaid.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that after a review of ongoing models, some will conclude early on Dec. 31 while others will end as scheduled. Participants -- typically health care providers -- will have through the end of the year to transition to other models \"to minimize disruption to their operations,\" CMS said in a statement.

Trucks would rumble by, carting away contaminated soil as part of a shipyard cleanup effort that has spanned\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov/public/profile_report?global_id=38440004\">39 years</url>. Harrison says the trucks were often uncovered, and she recalls seeing dirt blow over the street in clouds that looked like smoke.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You'd think it was a fire from blocks away,\" said Harrison, 58.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That dust - which she couldn't avoid inhaling -\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Toxic-soil-went-from-SF-s-Hunters-Point-to-12854269.php\">might</url>\u00a0have been contaminated with more than\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.contams&amp;id=0902722\">a hundred</url>\u00a0pollutants, some radioactive. Four generations of Harrisons, including Arieann's grandchildren, have lived in the neighborhood as the cleanup drags on. Marie Harrison, a prominent local environmental justice advocate and Arieann's mother, died of a chronic lung disease that her doctors suspected was precipitated by toxins. Arieann's father, who died in 2014, had cancer and her sister has cancer. Multiple tests of Arieann's blood and urine have detected radioactive compounds including plutonium and toxins like lead and arsenic, which also have been found at the shipyard. Arieann continues her mother's work advocating for a complete shipyard cleanup through the Marie Harrison Community Foundation.\u00a0</p><p>The shipyard, a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfpublicpress.org/exposed/\">notoriously toxic site</url>, is just one of thousands of contaminated parcels around the Bay Area undergoing remediation. These cleanups take longer in marginalized communities, according to a new San Francisco Public Press analysis of more than 20,000 sites of varying size across the nine-county Bay Area. In areas that scored high on a national index of socioeconomic vulnerability, the median cleanup took more than 450 days longer than in the least vulnerable areas. Many factors, including the type of toxin, the nature of the site and the complexity of the cleanup, could affect how long a remediation takes and explain some of the differences. But in a subset of more than 12,000 cleanups of comparable complexity, the disparities were even more pronounced.</p><p>Scientists and community organizers accuse regulators of prioritizing cleanups in wealthier, whiter areas. Regulators acknowledge that work can lag in marginalized communities but say they are hamstrung by insufficient money and staffing. For people living near toxic sites, slow or stalled cleanups mean longer exposure to harmful substances,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4038095/\">increasing the risk of sickness</url>.\u00a0</p><p>While the locations and history of toxic cleanups are well-documented, no public catalog of cleanup durations existed. To create one, the Public Press mapped three agencies' databases of thousands of cleanups and calculated their durations using start and end dates. As a measure of marginalization, the analysis used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index, which combines demographic data with poverty rates, access to transportation and other socioeconomic factors to score census tracts.\u00a0</p><p>Community advocates and researchers have long believed that regulators prioritize cleanups in areas where residents have the means to prompt action and protest delays.\u00a0</p><p>\"Cleanup standards for communities of color and low-income communities continue to lag behind those of other communities,\" said Bradley Angel, executive director of the watchdog group Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice. \"It's not that cleanups don't exist in other communities, but the problem is magnified here.\"\u00a0</p><p>Lindsey Dillon, an associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies the impact of toxic sites on surrounding communities, said the Public Press' findings are consistent with academic literature on environmental justice.</p><p>\"Marginalized groups get fewer resources,\" Dillon said.</p><p>Racial disparities are stark, the data shows. The median cleanup in areas with a very high proportion of residents who are Black, Indigenous or other people of color took nearly a year longer than the median cleanup in mostly white areas. In the subset of similar sites, the difference was more than two and a half years or 47%.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're seeing the results of racism,\" said Shirletha Holmes-Boxx, a Greenaction community organizer and policy advocate.\u00a0</p><p>When a cleanup drags on, the exposure period for nearby residents can too, which experts say increases the risk of getting sick.\u00a0</p><p>Dr. Ahimsa Porter Sumchai, who runs the Hunters Point Community Biomonitoring Program, has tested the blood and urine of people living near the shipyard, including Arieann Harrison, for contaminants. Harrison's doctors say the toxins found in her body have contributed to a host of symptoms, ranging from dizziness and nausea to a mysterious metallic taste in her mouth.\u00a0</p><p>In a different family Sumchai tested, every member had the same contaminants in their blood and urine. The older the family members were, the higher their pollutant concentrations.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's no question that the duration of exposure matters,\" Sumchai said.\u00a0</p><p>In an emailed statement, Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson Joshua Alexander attributed the cleanup's long duration to its complexity and acknowledged that\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfpublicpress.org/exposed-part-6-shuttered-radiation-lab-poses-ongoing-health-risks-for-growing-neighborhood/\">past fraud</url>\u00a0by the cleanup contractor Tetra Tech EC extended the timeline. He said the cleanup is moving as fast as it can, responsibly.</p><p>\"We work with the Navy to prioritize according to the worst risks first,\" Alexander said.\u00a0</p><p>Most contaminated sites are not nearly as toxic as the shipyard. But even relatively minor sites can generate low levels of chronic exposure, said Ian Wren, lead scientist at the watchdog organization San Francisco Baykeeper. Petroleum from leaking underground storage tanks at former gas stations, for instance, can cause short-term effects like nausea and dizziness. In the long term, they can cause liver and kidney damage, and increase cancer risk,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality\">according to the EPA</url>.</p><p>\"It's that chronic exposure that poses the greatest risk to communities,\" Wren said.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Residents in socially vulnerable communities are often already managing health conditions that can be exacerbated by toxic exposure, said Dillon, the UC Santa Cruz professor.\u00a0</p><p>\"All of those socioeconomic factors and health conditions make people even more vulnerable to the health risks of contamination,\" Dillon said. \"Socially vulnerable neighborhoods should be at the top of the list in terms of cleanup priority.\"\u00a0</p><p>Several regulators acknowledged that work has been slower in marginalized communities, though officials gave differing characterizations of the disparities. Cheryl Prowell has worked more than 17 years at regulatory agencies overseeing cleanups in California. Prowell is assistant deputy director of site mitigation and restoration at the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and formerly a supervising engineer at the State Water Resources Control Board, two of the agencies responsible for the cleanup sites the Public Press analyzed. She has seen slower action on cleanups in marginalized communities.\u00a0</p><p>\"I could see the difference. Understanding why that was true, I don't know, but both agencies are working to try to change that,\" Prowell said.\u00a0</p><p>Though she saw the inequity, Prowell said, officials had not been applying an environmental justice lens to the data until now.</p><p>\"I hope you will start to see these numbers change. There is so much to do,\" she said.</p><p>Working-class communities can face hurdles to protesting slow cleanups, said Julio Garcia, executive director of the South San Francisco environmental justice organization Rise South City. People in these communities working one or more jobs often don't have the luxury or ability to take unpaid time off to attend public meetings where they might exert pressure on regulators. It also takes time to learn about the risks of pollution and toxic exposure, Garcia said.</p><p>Socially vulnerable neighborhoods also tend to be on or near current and former industrial sites. Many are close to the former military installations that pepper Bay Area coastlines. These areas bear the brunt of the region's worst pollution, which may take more time to remediate.</p><p>\"As a rule, the most polluting activity is put where people least can resist it,\" said\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfpublicpress.org/bay-area-group-new-tool-reveals-worst-toxic-sites-refocusing-environmental-activism/\">Cade Cannedy</url>, program director at Climate Resilient Communities in East Palo Alto. \"The most polluted sites will be in communities of color. Smaller sites will also take longer to clean up in those communities, often because they have less power to resist it.\"</p><p>Conversely, more powerful communities can usher cleanups along, said Wren, the Baykeeper scientist.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Affluent communities can exert pressure on regulators to act, Wren said, adding that officials have told him resource-strapped agencies will not manage a site proactively unless a community forces them to do so.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's really a case of, the squeaky wheel gets the cleanup,\" he said.</p><p>Cleanups also happen faster when property owners can pay - and that's often the case for sites of planned redevelopment, said Prowell, of the Department of Toxic Substances Control. Developers have the money for cleanups and can pressure regulators to speed up the process, she said.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"The consultants and attorneys that work on the redevelopment projects are very persistent, so there is that element of 'squeaking' on redevelopment projects,\" she said, responding to Wren's \"squeaky wheel\" analogy.</p><p>Others contend that money doesn't buy influence in the cleanup process, at least not from the government side.</p><p>\"That's not my reality,\" said Marikka Hughes, branch chief at the Department of Toxic Substances Control, adding that the agency works to complete cleanups fairly.\u00a0</p><p>But cleanups that don't have sufficient funding or persistent attorneys can fall through the cracks. The process regularly stretches on for decades; dozens in the Bay Area have dragged on for more than half a century. More than a thousand have lasted longer than three decades.\u00a0</p><p>\"The idea that communities are waiting that long is heartbreaking,\" said Phoenix Armenta,\u00a0manager for climate equity and community engagement for the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission.</p><p>The correlation between social vulnerability and cleanup duration is not perfect. Census tracts with a \"moderate\" social vulnerability index had some of the longest cleanups, in some cases longer than sites in \"high\" social vulnerability areas. However, some of those \"moderate\" tracts are in communities like Bayview-Hunters Point, South San Francisco, East Oakland and East Palo Alto, widely considered marginalized relative to their immediate surroundings.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfpublicpress.org/brightline-defense-takes-on-san-franciscos-air-pollution-and-environmental-justice-concerns-qa-with-executive-director-eddie-ahn/\">Eddie Ahn</url>, the executive director of Brightline Defense, an environmental justice advocacy organization, has assessed the accuracy of a state screening tool similar to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index called CalEnviroScreen. Ahn noted that tools calibrated to a statewide or national scale often don't take into account the high cost of living in the Bay Area. That can lead to an underestimation of economic pain in the region. Moreover, neighborhoods like San Francisco's Mission District comprise luxury homes side by side with affordable housing, a complicated profile that is difficult to represent in an aggregate score like those produced by the CDC's index.\u00a0</p><p>That issue likely led a census tract in Hunters Point next to the shipyard to score \"moderate\" in social vulnerability. The tract contains new luxury homes whose residents are wealthier than those in the surrounding working-class neighborhood. That inflates the tract's median household income to $142,321, which is comparable to citywide levels, according to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US06075980600-census-tract-9806-san-francisco-ca/\">U.S. Census data</url>. The pocket of well-off residents misleads screening tools, resulting in a vulnerability score for the tract that is out of sync with the rest of the community, said Dillon, the UC Santa Cruz professor, who has assessed several such tools.</p><p>Since the overall dataset includes a range of cleanup types, including exceptionally complex and hazardous sites, the Public Press also analyzed a subset of sites with similar characteristics. That analysis showed even more pronounced disparities.\u00a0</p><p>Old underground storage tanks are scattered across communities of all levels of vulnerability. Often relics of old gas stations, they frequently leak gasoline into the surrounding soil and groundwater. As cleanups go, they are relatively simple, and the cleanup protocol is consistent across sites.\u00a0</p><p>The median duration of leaking underground storage tank cleanups in high vulnerability areas was more than two years longer than comparable cleanups in the lowest vulnerability areas. The median cleanup took even longer in moderate social vulnerability areas, where scores may be affected by pockets of gentrification.</p><p>\"It's another example of our communities being left behind, forgotten about and disenfranchised,\" said Adele Watts, the interim Northern California co-director for the environmental justice advocacy group Communities for a Better Environment.</p><p>The state Water Resources Control Board, which oversees the cleanups of underground storage tanks, is aware that cleanups take longer in more vulnerable communities. Annalisa Kihara, the agency's assistant deputy director in the Division of Water Quality, said the agency is revising its process to prioritize communities that are most burdened with pollution, and that it has an initiative for expediting stalled cases.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're holding a mirror up to ourselves,\" Kihara said.\u00a0</p><p>Underground storage tank cleanups in marginalized neighborhoods may take longer because those neighborhoods are more burdened with various kinds of pollution, and there's a greater likelihood that contamination from a given underground storage tank is interacting with other toxic substances.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're often finding a soup of contaminants,\" Kihara said.\u00a0</p><p>If multiple parties are responsible for the pollution, that will slow the cleanup too, she said.\u00a0</p><p>Regulators at the Department of Toxic Substances Control said they aspire to prioritize projects based on risk to human health and whether the site is going to have housing, but that insufficient funding can limit their ability to do so.\u00a0</p><p>Site remediation in California operates under a \"polluter pays\" model, where the property owner is responsible for covering costs for testing and treatment as well as agency staff time. When the property owner doesn't have sufficient money, regulators dip into limited - and\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://bes.dtsc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/01/01162024-Item-6-Complete-DTSC-Budget-Update-January-2024-ADA.pdf\">dwindling</url>\u00a0- pools of funding. But there isn't enough of it, said the department's Hughes. Other officials agreed more funding is needed to advance cleanups.</p><p>The agency representatives described underground storage tanks as a success story.

This legislation shapes the U.S. food system and covers everything from nutrition to conservation and crop insurance. The last food and farm bill expired in September 2023, and Congress passed a one-year extension shortly after to keep agricultural programs running until a new bill is signed into law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Rural Prosperity and Food Security Act, proposed but not yet introduced in full by Stabenow, critically protects climate-friendly guardrails around billions of dollars in investments from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that are intended to support farmers in being part of the climate solution. Thompson's proposal suggests removing those guardrails to allow funding to be used for practices with no demonstrated climate benefits.</p><p>A truly sustainable agricultural system must include sustainable working conditions. A review of Stabenow's proposal indicates that her bill would improve coordination across the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for food and farmworkers by reauthorizing and expanding the Farmworker Coordinator position and providing workers with support to withstand disruptions to the food and farm economy, whether from extreme weather or global pandemics.</p><p>The proposal also includes provisions to create a more just and equitable food and farm system by increasing support for farmers who have been historically underserved or excluded from USDA support and services - namely Black farmers and ranchers, Indigenous producers and other farmers of color - and ensuring that all farmers, no matter their background, can compete and succeed. Thompson's House proposal does not appear to contain any provisions to address the needs of workers or historically underserved farmers.</p><p>Finally, the Senate proposal would protect modernization of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to ensure that food assistance reflects the true cost of a nutritious diet based on the latest scientific and dietary guidelines.</p><p>Below is a statement by Melissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs in the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists:</p><p>\"Farmers are increasingly impacted by extreme weather driven by climate change, and any final food and farm bill must help farmers become more resilient to climate impacts like increasingly severe droughts, extreme heat and flooding while also reducing agricultural emissions that are contributing to the climate crisis. Protecting and preserving Inflation Reduction Act conservation funding for climate-smart farming practices is critical and should not be up for discussion or negotiation. This isn't a fringe issue - polls show that the public strongly supports programs that help farmers protect their farms from extreme weather, like those funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>\"The public also supports protecting the workers who keep our country fed and helping people of color and young people succeed in agriculture. Senator Stabenow's proposal takes important steps to rectify a history of exclusion and discrimination by addressing the unique barriers faced by historically underserved farmers and ranchers and finally recognizing food and farmworkers as a critical part of our agriculture and food system.

Gov. Moore Announces Launch of Major New Grant Program to Expand Statewide Use of Electric School Buses", "published": "2024-12-12", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gov. Wes Moore, D-Maryland, issued the following news release on Dec. 11, 2024:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Wes Moore today announced the launch of the Maryland Energy Administration's new program to expand the number of electric school buses in use across the state. As a key pillar of the governor's $90 million climate pledge, the program will help cut emissions that drive climate change and improve the health of Maryland's schoolkids.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Many communities are already seeing the consequences of climate change in their own backyards. Now, we need to ensure more Marylanders can see themselves in the progress of climate action,\" said Gov. Moore. \"Electrifying our school bus fleet isn't just the responsible choice for our environment -- it's also the smart thing for our state's economic competitiveness and our children's health.\"</p><p>The Maryland Energy Administration will offer up to $17 million through the Fiscal Year 2025 Maryland Electric School Bus Grant Program for electric school buses, charging infrastructure and associated costs. Eligible applicants can receive up to 85% of the incremental cost of purchasing qualified electric school buses. The program provides up to $1.5 million per grantee, with an increased cap of $2 million for income-qualified applicants or large school districts.</p><p>Priority will be given to projects benefiting Title I Schools and underserved communities.</p><p>Funding is distributed as cost reimbursement, with partial awards available to maximize program impact. Local school districts are eligible to submit applications to purchase school buses. Applications must be submitted by the district to support their fleet or fund efforts by their private vendors or contractors.</p><p>Any publicly funded school bus procured by an eligible entity for the routine transportation of students for school or school-related programming or activities is also eligible for consideration. Vehicles must be purchased new--retrofits or repowered vehicles are not eligible. A vehicle that has been funded in whole or in part by another Maryland state agency grant may also not be funded through this program.</p><p>\"The Maryland Electric School Bus Grant Program represents a convergence of the state's climate, equity and economic goals. The program enables Maryland communities to overcome the initial costs associated with the shift to cleaner vehicles so that they can receive the long-term savings that come with reduced fuel and maintenance costs,\" said Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul G. Pinsky. \"Because of this program, our kids will breathe cleaner air and our return on the investment of public funds will expand. That's a clear win-win for Maryland.\"</p><p>The window for applications for the Fiscal Year 2025 Maryland Electric School Bus Grant Program will close on February 14, 2025 at 3 p.m. EST.

Trump's Environmental Protection Agency in mid-February placed an extraordinary freeze on one of the largest climate programs in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. A federal court is now weighing whether that action defied EPA's contractual obligations, several laws and the grantees' Constitutional rights to due process of law, with the next hearing in the case set for Wednesday.</p><p>The fight in Washington threatens to slow Bridge of Grace's plans to expand its work buying and rehabilitating dilapidated houses in Fort Wayne. The group aims to reduce blight, provide much-needed housing for low-income families and cut energy consumption and costs with efficiency and appliance upgrades. And yet, de Leon remains optimistic that some good can still come of this.</p><p>\"I put everything in God's hands,\" he said. \"If it doesn't happen, you know, something else, bigger and better, will come out.\"</p><p>But the wait for a program like this one already had been long.</p><p>Climate activists had advocated for nearly two decades for a \"green bank\" that would use federal money to spur private investment in the clean energy transition. Low-interest loans could spur homes and businesses to adopt renewable energy and efficiency upgrades, especially in disadvantaged areas. This idea became law in 2022, but it has now run into the buzzsaw of Trump administration budget cuts and attempts to do away with Biden-era climate programs, sending shockwaves across the country to local governments, lenders, developers, small businesses and others that were counting on having access to these loans.</p><p>Participants saw in the program an opportunity for the government to boost local economies while improving the environment and saving money. The Trump administration characterized it as a giveaway-potentially, a criminal one-that was part of a harmful green agenda. Trump's team also is using the fight over the climate fund to assert an expansive view of executive power-arguing that any federal contracts can be brushed aside based on a change in policy priorities by a new administration.\u00a0</p><p>\"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left, activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\" said Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA under Trump.</p><p>An EPA spokesperson declined to comment, saying the matter is in litigation and the agency has laid out its case in court filings.</p><p>The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was unlike any other of the thousands of environmental grants that the Biden administration awarded under the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. It was not meant to be a government handout, but rather seed money to get private lenders to finance the clean energy transition at the ground level.</p><p>Climate policy thinkers began talking about the concept nearly 20 years ago. Government couldn't fund a clean energy transition all on its own, they reasoned. Instead, government could assume some of the risk and provide guidance that would spur private lenders to begin making the kind of loans they weren't making-for energy-efficiency and renewable energy projects for homes and small businesses, especially in low-income communities that needed the most help.</p><p>\"It was designed to address sort of market failures in certain areas, especially low-income neighborhoods where generating a transition to clean energy and energy efficiency can both reduce bills and address the climate crisis by reducing emissions,\" said U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in a recent interview. He introduced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1698?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22climate+bank%22%7D&amp;s=5&amp;r=1\">one of the first green bank proposals</url> in Congress in 2009, when he was still a member of the House.</p><p>It was one of the only ideas to garner bipartisan support in a committee vote that year as Congress debated President Barack Obama's ill-fated climate legislation, co-sponsored by current Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), then a representative. The big bill, which would have capped U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and employed a market-based trading system to drive investment, died in the Senate.</p><p>In 2011, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) picked up the <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/11052011/bingaman-murkowski-senate-clean-energy-ceda/\">green bank</url> idea, working on a bill with former Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), then chair of the Senate Energy Committee, who saw it as one of the only climate solutions that could get GOP support. Said Murkowski, \"It's a smarter, more efficient way for the federal government to promote clean energy technologies.\"</p><p>As it turned out, Congress would not take up climate legislation again for more than a decade. But in the meantime, the green bank idea took off in states and around the world. Connecticut's state legislature paved the way for the nation's first green bank by bipartisan vote in 2011, and since then <url normalizedValue=\"https://coalitionforgreencapital.com/american-green-bank-consortium/\">20 more public and quasi-public</url> green banks have been established from Hawaii to Rhode Island, including in red states like Texas, Missouri and South Carolina.\u00a0</p><p>Green banks have been established in the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and other countries. The Natural Resources Defense Council calculates that such banks have funded <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrdc.org/greenbanknetwork\">$143 billion</url> in clean energy projects that have cut climate-damaging emissions equivalent to taking 25 million gasoline cars off the road.</p><p>A key feature of green banks is their multiplier effect. Public money is meant to act as a backstop that gives private lenders, mostly credit unions and small community banks, the confidence to lend larger sums to get climate-friendly projects done. Such lenders are accustomed to financing home mortgages and auto loans, not clean energy.</p><p>\"Financing in clean energy, energy efficiency, solar and so forth is a very specialized market,\" said Bert Hunter, executive vice president and chief investment officer of the Connecticut Green Bank, who sees its job as providing \"a pathway for local lenders to get acquainted with this market.\"</p><p>Since its inception 13 years ago, private lenders have put $7 into clean energy projects for every $1 loaned by the Connecticut Green Bank-for a total of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ctgreenbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/FY12-FY24-Connecticut-Green-Bank-Impact-Report-8-30-2024.pdf\">$2.9 billion</url>. The money has financed energy upgrades for more than 63,000 Connecticut families and 8,000 businesses. Delinquency rates have been low or on par with national averages for mortgage and auto loans, even though 32 percent of the lending has been in low-income and disadvantaged communities, which have fewer resources.\u00a0</p><p>Van Hollen says the combined economic and environmental benefits, plus reduced reliance on foreign oil, make green banks a \"win-win-win\" public policy. \"This is a case where it needed some government incentive to make these necessary changes and to move in the direction of more clean energy, more energy efficiency,\" he said. When the opportunity finally came in 2022 to advance climate legislation in Congress, Van Hollen and Markey worked with the Biden administration to make sure that the Inflation Reduction Act included a provision for a green bank, now called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.</p><p>Because the IRA was a budget reconciliation bill-a special type of legislation that requires only a simple majority for Senate passage-it had to be designed as a grant program. But the $27 billion wouldn't be spent and gone as with the other grants. The recipients would work in partnership with private lenders to generate loans to be paid back with interest, with the proceeds reinvested in more clean energy projects over time.</p><p>Supporters of the fund point to evidence that it was working, even in its earliest stages. One of the main recipients, the Coalition for Green Capital, had already closed six clean energy projects totaling $33.7 million by the end of 2024, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874838-33-28\">court testimony</url>. Those deals attracted $192 million in private investment; every $1 of federal money was mobilizing $6 of private capital. The coalition told the court it received many more proposals and was considering funding 24 that would have deployed a combined $16 in private financing for every $1 of financing by the federal government.\u00a0</p><p>But this work, an estimated $85 billion in clean energy projects, is now on hold, blocked by the Trump administration's attempt to radically reconfigure the congressionally approved fund.</p><p>The Trump administration has sought to slash government spending across the board, but its attack on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund has been on a different level.</p><p>Trump and his team didn't just seek to claw back $20 billion of the awarded money; they launched a criminal investigation into the program. They notified grantees that their contracts were terminated \"based on substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency's priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.\"\u00a0</p><p>Zeldin targeted three-quarters of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including the entirety of two programs, the National Clean Investment Fund, designed to help finance low- and zero-emissions energy projects, more than half of them in low-income and disadvantaged communities, and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, which works with community-based lenders to finance such projects for individuals and small businesses, all of them in disadvantaged areas.\u00a0</p><p>\"I will not rest until these hard-earned taxpayer dollars are returned to the U.S. Treasury,\" Zeldin said in a press statement.</p><p>In EPA's <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874697-49\">latest court briefs</url>, however, the agency spends less time on allegations of wrongdoing, although it does say the criminal investigation is ongoing. The agency spends more time on its authority under law, claiming that it has the right to break contracts if its priorities change.\u00a0</p><p>The Trump administration argues that grant recipients may be able to pursue a claim in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (where the only relief would be monetary), but it can not be forced \"to proceed with billions of dollars in grants that it has decided no longer advance the interests of the United States.\"</p><p>The shift in the arguments comes after the grantees challenged many of the Trump EPA's arguments:</p><p>U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan concluded that so far the Trump administration has \"proffered no evidence to support their basis for the sudden terminations\" of the contracts. On March 18, she blocked the EPA from taking back the money, but did not free it up for the grantees. It is now sitting in the accounts at Citibank while the litigation proceeds.</p><p>This program represents the first time EPA, which had never before administered such a large grant initiative, has used an outside financial agent like Citibank. But such agreements have been used often by the federal government to handle large transactions, including to transmit assistance to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0</p><p>The arrangement \"increased transactional visibility\" for EPA and was designed specifically to give the agency a security interest in the money-a legal right to the funds if the grant recipient had not performed its contractual duties, an official of the Coalition for Green Capital <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874897-33-27\">told the court</url>. Such an arrangement was not possible through the government's in-house government grant distribution system.</p><p>Indeed, one portion of the fund-the $7 billion Solar for All program-is not being held up but is being administered to 60 grantees nationwide through the government's grant distribution system. The Trump administration froze this money for a time, but released it amid continuing court battles over its latitude to block congressionally approved grant programs.</p><p>In Van Hollen's view, the use of Citibank as an outside financial agent got under the skin of Trump administration officials in their effort to assert control at all levels of government.</p><p>\"I believe they're frustrated because the Biden administration was able to place these funds beyond their clawback reach,\" Van Hollen said. \"So they're just manufacturing claims, and that manufacturing of claims is itself a fraud. It's a fraud on the public.\"</p><p>The Trump administration's attacks on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program are an extension of a fight that right-wing foes have been waging against the program since its inception. When winners of the fund's grants were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-billion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and\">first announced</url> on April 4, 2024, by Vice President Kamala Harris in a visit to North Carolina, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, whose YouTube channel has more than 7 million subscribers, posted a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7XIjWVQibw\">segment</url> mocking Harris' speaking mannerisms and ridiculing the planned central role of community banks (\"so wildly profitable compared to the big banks,\" he said, sardonically).</p><p>The day before the November election, House Republicans posted a report decrying the Biden-Harris administration's environmental justice grants as a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/e-and-c-republican-staff-report-details-cronyism-within-biden-harris-epa-s-multibillion-dollar-environmental-justice-grant-programs-1\">green group giveaway</url>.\" They singled out Power Forward Communities, a new coalition that had been awarded $2 billion from the federal fund for financing home energy efficiency upgrades at scale. The report said the administration \"financially rewarded another organization espousing its same policy views.\"</p><p>On Dec. 3, the right-wing group Project Veritas, which specializes in hidden camera recordings to attack political opponents, posted a video of a young EPA staffer, Brent Efron, apparently captured in a social setting, describing colorfully how the Biden administration was getting grant money out the door before Trump's inauguration. \"It truly feels like we're on the Titanic ... throwing gold bars off the edge,\" he said in the video.</p><p>But Efron's lawyer, Mark Zaid, has said his client was not referring to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Efron only joined the EPA last July, according to his LinkedIn profile, and was still in graduate school when the grant awards were announced last April.</p><p>Nevertheless, Zeldin has adopted \"gold bars\" as his mantra in a drive to seize the money. He cited the Project Veritas video on Feb. 12 when he first announced he was referring the matter to U.S. Department of Justice investigators. His office again cited the video in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-03/epaigrequest030225.pdf\">a March 2 letter</url> to the EPA's Office of Inspector General, the first detailed public accounting of the Trump administration's case against the program.</p><p>It has been a stunning reversal of fortune and elevation in status for Project Veritas, which over the years has gotten a portion of its <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874829-fossil-fuel-industry-and-allies-funding-of-project-veritas#document/p1/a2630004\">funding from fossil fuel industry allies</url>. Project Veritas had been under criminal investigation for paying $40,000 to two Florida residents who had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/09/aimee-harris-biden-daughter-diary-00151311\">pleaded guilty</url> to stealing the diary of Biden's daughter in an effort to embarrass him.</p><p>Within two weeks of Trump's inauguration, though, the Justice Department announced it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/justice-dept-project-veritas-ashley-biden.html\">not bring charges</url> against Project Veritas. And the next week, Zeldin cited the group's covert recording as the basis for the Trump administration's own criminal investigation.</p><p>That probe got off to a rocky start. Denise Cheung, the head of the criminal division in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., a 24-year veteran of the department, handed in her resignation after she was ordered to freeze the Citibank accounts and issue subpoenas.\u00a0</p><p>According to her resignation letter, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/18/read-resignation-letter-denise-cheung/\">made public</url> by The Washington Post, she told Trump administration officials she had no legal authority to order such a freeze and her team concluded the evidence, including the Project Veritas video, did not meet the threshold for opening a grand jury investigation.</p><p>The case was then taken up personally by the Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, a longtime conservative activist who called the federal program \"insanity\" and \"total graft\" in <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1849039688251691015\">a post on X</url> in October.</p><p>But a U.S. magistrate judge in D.C. rejected Martin's application for a seizure warrant, and the Justice Department transferred the probe to Florida. \"This chain of events provides abundant reason to believe that the Trump administration is purposefully misusing the tools of law enforcement, and pursuing false allegations of criminal conduct,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-11-Letter-to-DOJ-and-FBI-re-Greenhouse-Gas-Reduction-Fund.pdf\">wrote</url> Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) in one of several queries Democratic senators have<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-democratic?ID=51219611-4681-4DE8-AFAC-C5C6CEBADA22\"> sent</url> to administration officials.</p><p>A hearing in the lawsuit brought by grantees was originally scheduled for March 11, but the Trump administration asked for a 24-hour delay, which it used to send termination notices to all the grant recipients. The following day, it asked the court to dismiss the case because, among other things, the grants had been terminated and the case was moot.\u00a0</p><p>But the judge did not buy it, saying EPA's unilateral cancellation of the grants meant the grantees were even more within their rights to sue. Even if EPA has valid concerns, Chutkan said it had failed to follow the procedures required by law, including providing recipients with an opportunity to object and challenge a termination.</p><p>But the Trump EPA, in briefs filed last week in anticipation of Wednesday's hearing, made clear its view that the grant recipients have no legal rights to the money. \"Nothing in the Constitution or any statute compels EPA to make these grants to these Plaintiffs,\" the administration's brief said. \"At most, those authorities direct EPA to re-obligate the funds for specified purposes, which EPA has stated it will do.\"</p><p>Lawyers for grant recipient Climate United said the Trump administration's latest filings display \"a remarkable view of Executive power.\" EPA, they said, is arguing that it has \"an unfettered and unreviewable right to cancel grants and claw back funds that were already distributed to recipients,\" not because of any failure or wrongdoing, but due to a change in policy.\u00a0</p><p>Among the people frustrated by the funding cutoff is David Shadburne, CEO of MidWest America Federal Credit Union in Fort Wayne. The credit union, founded in 1936 and with 15 branches in northeast Indiana, had qualified for an $11 million grant under the federal fund. The institution had been working with local charities, contractors and others to publicize the loans and prepare to make the most of this opportunity. One of those charities was Bridge of Grace Compassionate Ministries.</p><p>\"There's a lot of misinformation about how money is just kind of falling from heaven, and there's no rules, controls, constraints, and it's going to organizations that may not even know what they're doing,\" Shadburne said. \"We're not some fly-by-night organization.\"</p><p>MidWest America had gone through an extensive review process with Inclusiv, a New York-based charitable lender founded in 1974 that was set to get $1.87 billion to work with local credit unions to provide loans under the federal program.\u00a0</p><p>Shadburne noted that participants such as his credit union needed to put up double the amount of federal money they were to receive, so in his case this means the $11 million from the government is being blended with $22 million from his credit union to start a revolving loan fund.</p><p>He participated in months of virtual training through the University of New Hampshire and must provide detailed reports on how the money is spent.</p><p>\"This was not done willy-nilly,\" he said.</p><p>The availability of federal money allows the credit union to charge a lower-than-market interest rate for loans under the program. For example, a local resident or business could get a loan to improve insulation and replace windows on a property at an interest rate of about 7 percent as opposed to a typical rate that would be more than 10 percent.</p><p>The borrower saves up to thousands of dollars in interest, and the credit union can give loans to people with lower incomes and lower credit scores than would ordinarily qualify.</p><p>\"In the long term, we believe it's also going to be an economic driver,\" Shadburne said. \"People are going to have to go and buy energy efficient appliances. They're going to buy new windows, doors, insulation. They're going to buy the heat pumps and other things.\"</p><p>And that will be a boost for manufacturers, retailers, contractors, and will save on energy costs for consumers, he said.</p><p>As people pay their loans back, the federal portion goes back into the loan fund to be used again to help others, which is the essence of a revolving loan.</p><p>Some of this kind of work was being done already in Fort Wayne, but the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was going to allow it to be conducted on a larger scale that would serve many more people and businesses.</p><p>How does Shadburne feel to see these efforts stymied under misleading pretenses?</p><p>\"It's infuriating,\" he said.</p><p>Across the country, charitable organizations and businesses are now in the awkward position of having little or no money to run programs that they had been publicizing.</p><p>\"It's extremely frustrating,\" said Andreas Karelas, executive director of RE-volv in San Francisco, a nonprofit that helps churches, charities, tribal governments and others develop solar power.</p><p>\"The risk is that you're going to scare off potential collaborators that are going to say, 'Wait a minute. Are we ever going to get this?'\" he said. \"You're going to be damaging the reputation of groups like RE-volv and others that are in the space that are unable to deliver on their promises because of this type of malarkey that EPA is causing.\"</p><p>His nonprofit has been in discussions with local groups in 25 states that were taking steps to launch projects using the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Those groups are now waiting for resolution.</p><p>Grantees have told the judge that they have not been able to make payroll or pay contractors. The Coalition for Green Capital said some participants in its loan program have delayed deploying any of the funds because of uncertainty; one Midwestern financial institution told the group its board had voted not to accept money from the coalition after hearing Zeldin's remarks on the program.</p><p>The Coalition for Green Capital \"will never know how many opportunities it lost as a result of potential partners' concerns that ... funding will be delayed for months or years of litigation,\" said the group's CEO, Richard Kauffman, in <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874838-33-28\">a court filing.</url></p><p>In Minnesota, John Vaughn is helping several local and tribal governments as they try to get loans through the federal fund. He is managing director of community development and finance for Fresh Energy, a clean energy advocacy organization based in St. Paul.</p><p>\"There's a lot of people pulling their hair out,\" he said.</p><p>While this is a partisan issue in Washington, with a Republican president seeking to undo a program signed into law by a Democratic president, Vaughn sees no partisanship in the way local leaders discuss the opportunities they could have with the federal money.</p><p>Washington \"almost seems like it's a different world that's disconnected from what I personally experience working in communities,\" he said.</p><p>There are similar sentiments in Appalachia, according to Dana Kuhnline, senior program director for ReImagine Appalachia, a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit that helps local governments and labor organizations with climate-friendly development.</p><p>\"It's really heartbreaking,\" she said of the effects of the funding delays. \"Communities were ready to hit the ground at a sprint.\"</p><p>Efficiency Maine, a nonprofit that makes loans to help people switch to cleaner and cheaper heating systems, has said it will run out of money in one of its loan programs within 12 months unless the federal government releases its funding.</p><p>Homeowners in Maine are more dependent on oil heating than residents in any other state, saddling them with high fuel and maintenance costs as well as pollution. Efficiency Maine had planned to finance 1,243 home conversions from oil to electric heat pumps per year with the federal funds. Such a switch could save the average Maine household $704 per year in heating costs, a 23 percent reduction, while its carbon pollution would fall 67 percent.\u00a0</p><p>This loss of funding will \"disproportionately impact creditworthy small businesses and low- and moderate-income households who face steeper barriers to financing such projects than other customer classes,\" said Michael Stoddard, executive director at Efficiency Maine, in an email.</p><p>The people who agreed to speak about their experiences are the exception.

Harris campaigns on permitting reform.", "published": "2024-09-30", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Adam Aton Vice President Kamala Harris is embracing a surprising election strategy: elevating the technocratic subject of permitting reform into a pillar of her presidential campaign. The Harris campaign last Thursday released an economic policy blueprint that calls for a double-barreled approach to hastening the renewable energy transition: more federal subsidies, combined with easier permitting rules. That follows a major speech Harris gave Wednesday spotlighting the role federal permitting plays in areas such as housing supply and manufacturing investment. It's there she promised to \"cut red tape and get things moving faster.\" </p><p>\"The simple truth is, in America, it takes too long and it costs too much to build,\" Harris said at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh. \"Whether it's a new housing development, a new factory, or a new bridge, projects take too long to go from concept to reality. It happens in blue states, it happens in red states, and it's a national problem.\" The vice president said she would work with business executives and community leaders to shorten the permitting process. That marks another turn toward the center for Harris. She already has disavowed her 2019 call for a fracking ban and in general has distanced herself from the other climate policies of her previous presidential campaign, such as banning offshore drilling and single-use plastics. Permitting reform has historically alarmed environmentalists, including environmental justice advocates who see the permitting process - and the litigation it can spawn - as one of their best defenses against heaping more burdens onto communities that already experience high cumulative impacts of pollution and climate change. Harris' turn on the issue illustrates how much the political and economic landscape has changed since her last campaign, when the then-senator from California instead sought to add new layers to federal permitting. In 2020, after circulating draft text for about a year, Harris and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York sponsored the \"Climate Equity Act .\" Aimed at elevating frontline communities in the permitting process, the bill would have required federal regulations and investments to undergo additional climate and environmental justice analyses, including expanded opportunities for public comment and judicial review. Harris cast the \"Climate Equity Act\" as a step toward bringing \"a Green New Deal closer to reality.\" \"It is not enough to simply cut emissions and end our reliance on fossil fuels,\" Harris said at the time . \"We must ensure that communities already contending with unsafe drinking water, toxic air, and lack of economic opportunity are not left behind.\" On Wednesday, Harris instead framed federal permitting as holding back the U.S. economy. \"China is not moving slowly. They're not. And we can't afford to, either,\" the vice president said. \"The Empire State Building, you know how long it took to build that? One year. The Pentagon, you know how long that took? 16 months.\" \"No one can tell me we can't build quickly in our country. I've got empirical evidence,\" she said. The Harris campaign did not respond to questions about whether the vice president still supports the \"Climate Equity Act,\" which did not advance and has not been reintroduced during the last two Congresses. Her new policy blueprint, though, notes that the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act included a funding boost to speed up the permitting process. It also says Harris \"helped finalize\" a rule aimed at streamlining federal permits , and that she \"pushed to increase the number of projects that qualify for the simplest form of environmental review so that agencies can expedite projects that will lower costs without harming the environment.\" Harris' turnabout on permitting echoes some other greens who are softening their positions now that the Inflation Reduction Act has spurred a rush of clean energy investment. With federal tax credits flowing to solar and wind projects, the permitting process has emerged as a bottleneck to the energy transition. Lena Moffitt, executive director of the climate policy and advocacy group Evergreen Action, hailed Harris' economic plan as a boon for clean energy deployment, especially in the manufacturing sector. \"Her commonsense efforts to cut red tape across multiple sectors are vital to accelerating the expansion of clean, affordable energy and lower household energy costs while creating millions of good-paying union jobs,\" Moffitt said in a statement. Permitting reform remains fraught for climate hawks. Two recent efforts to relax permitting rules - a bipartisan Senate bill spearheaded in part by West Virginia independent Sen. Joe Manchin, and a recently passed bill to exempt some semiconductor plants from environmental reviews - have split Democrats as well as their allies. But when it comes to Harris' permitting reforms, even the most progressive groups have given her cover. One reason is her plan doesn't spell out exactly what permitting changes she would seek. The other is that they think those fights can wait until after the election. \"It's really hard to figure out exactly how to dramatically expand renewable energy,\" said Saul Levin, campaigns and political director for the Green New Deal Network. But, he added, there's no comparison between Harris' proposals and those of former President Donald Trump. \"Are we going to allow Project 2025 to move forward, leading to the deaths and suffering of millions of people?\" he asked, referring to the conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration. \"Our plan is to win, and then have a really robust discussion and push her as much as possible.\" That view was echoed by the Sunrise Movement, which praised Harris' economic proposals as a \"big step towards lowering prices, expanding green energy production, and creating green, union jobs. \"It importantly recognizes that good climate policy must be woven into every policy, from housing to education to energy,\" said Stevie O'Hanlon, the group's communications director. \"Let's be clear: This plan isn't as bold as science demands,\" O'Hanlon said. \"We have just six years to act to ensure a livable planet for our generation. We need more. On Nov. 6, we'll be there demanding that. But, in the meantime, we will focus on defeating Donald Trump.\"</p>", "publisher": "ClimateWire", "instances": ["Harris' turn on the issue illustrates how much the political and economic landscape has changed since her last campaign, when the then-senator from California instead sought to add new layers to federal permitting.
