This plan is not about innovation for the public good. It's about deepening the grip of Big Tech and Big Oil on our economy, environment, and democracy. A People's AI Action plan, one that delivers on public well-being, shared prosperity, a sustainable future, and security for all is what's in order.</p><p>The Administration's plan \"to win the AI race\" eliminates the few existing protections and guardrails that exist to regulate AI.

It is privatization of the public future. The unrestrained and unaccountable development of AI, integrated into every aspect of society will drain and pollute our water, air, and land, and structure the economy at the expense of already struggling families and underpaid workers. Massive data centers needed to power AI, which operate with little transparency, place enormous strain on already-fragile infrastructure -- reviving the coal industry and expanding natural gas, draining public water in drought-stricken regions, destabilizing power grids, and driving up utility costs and housing prices for working people. The plan also opens up the development of public lands for data centers and new fossil fuel projects, when we need to end dependency on fossil fuels.</p><p>Among other harmful provisions, the plan:</p><p>* Further reduces the power of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and reduces permitting requirements to fast-track data centers despite their dangers and harms to communities</p><p>* Opens federal lands to data center and fossil fuel projects and paves the way for nuclear energy</p><p>* Promotes military and surveillance use of AI</p><p>\"Training an AI model can emit almost 5 times the lifetime emissions of the average American car.

These rulings mark a turning point in international law, recognizing states' legal obligations to prevent climate harm and protect the rights of present and future generations.</p><p>The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in an advisory opinion released on 3 July at the request of Chile and Colombia, laid out states' legal obligations to confront the climate crisis through a human rights lens. The opinion emphasizes the vastly unequal impacts of climate breakdown and affirms the rights of frontline communities to redress and reparation.</p><p>Just weeks later, on the 23rd of July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) echoed this urgency, declaring climate change an \"an existential threat\" and confirming that greenhouse gas emissions are unequivocally caused by human activity. The ICJ's opinion, prompted by a request from a group of youth campaigners in the Pacific Islands, reinforces that states have binding legal duties to protect the climate for not only present but also future generations.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because until now, international legal standards on climate change and human rights have been evolving across different forums, with varying interpretations of what States are required to do. These advisory opinions bring much-needed clarity and coherence. They are authoritative interpretations from the world's highest courts: opinions that carry significant legal weight.</p><p>Importantly, both advisory opinions also clarified that states must regulate private actors whose conduct contributes to climate harm, and that the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is a human right. As the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) noted, this ruling \"ends fossil fuel impunity\" and lays the groundwork for holding major polluters accountable.</p><p>Taken together, these opinions strengthen what CESR and our partners continue to champion: human rights must be at the heart of climate action.

In moments of alignment, their fields reinforce each other, giving new vitality and perspective.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet not all orbits are stable and the gravitational field of AI is growing at an accelerated pace. The ultimate danger we face is the potential for AI to swallow everything around it, much like a black hole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AI has the potential to illuminate patterns in climate data, sharpen models and increase our chances to forecast an uncertain future. Yet there is a justified concern over the carbon footprint of big AI model training, the secrecy surrounding it, and the risk of exclusionparticularly with communities already on the fringes of both climate and tech discourse. The risk is that AI becomes the superstar rather than co-star, disrupting the equilibrium of the whole system. The question, therefore, is not whether or not these two spheres can coexist, but whether or not they can do so in mutually reinforcing terms.</p><p>In this time of rapid information consumption, one of the greatest challenges may simply be to open the door to conversation. In other words, not to idealize or dismiss AI, but to collaborate on conventions, best practices and boundaries that will govern its development within the climate realm in general and climate justice more specifically. Indifference can relegate the silent stakeholder to the sidelines, and the climate community could miss an opportunity to be fully engaged in what could possibly be one of the most transformative developments of our era.</p><p>Understanding where climate justice and AI meet should not be a pure academic exercise either. It should require dialogue that flows between technical, ethical, community, policy, political, environmental and social spaces. The effort should be rooted in the needs of the day-to-day lives of people most vulnerable to both climate hazards and technological exclusion.</p><p>In an initial effort to try to understand the relationships and tensions between AI and climate justice, we can use a popular strategist's toolkit: the SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis. By examining AI and climate justice in the context of this analysis, we can start exploring what this relationship might look like.</p><p>AI's ability to quickly process massive, unrelated datasets, from weather patterns to social media sentiment, is transforming climate work across different fields. Emergency responders can use AI to optimize response times following hurricanes or wildfires. In Southeast Asia and East Africa, AI-powered early warning systems are already saving lives. Satellite imagery that once took weeks to process can now be assessed in hours. As a consequence, deforestation in the Amazon, coastal erosion in Bangladesh and methane flares in Texas are all being tracked with unprecedented precision.</p><p>The benefits of AI, however, are not evenly distributed and are counterbalanced by evident weaknesses. One of the many problems is data imbalance, as some of the communities most vulnerable to climate changesuch as Indigenous and rural farming communitiesare not properly represented in the data that AI uses. These omissions can lead to considerable bias: for example, a flood simulation program that is ignorant of the topography of slums could underestimate the potential hazards involved; likewise, a wildfire model that lacks understanding of traditional land management may overlook essential firebreaks.</p><p>It is also costly to train large AI models, requiring computer power, electricity, broadband connectivity and skills. These conditions are unaffordable for most nations in the Global South, as well as for local communities in the Global North. AI is, in this case, a luxury.</p><p>Additionally, AI's unexplainabilityor its \"black box\" statusraises issues of accountability. If AI is used to decide where adaptation finance should be invested, or whose communities should be evacuated, stakeholders need to be able to question those decisions. But if the models can't explain how and why they're reaching certain conclusions, how can they be trusted, or challenged?</p><p>And then there's the environmental cost. In an ironic twist, training AI models takes vast amounts of energyenergy that is often generated by fossil fuels. Research shows that building one advanced language model can create as much carbon as five cars emit during their lifetimes. If AI is to be part of the climate solution, it first needs to fix its own contribution to the problem.</p><p>Yet there are also numerous opportunities to use AI for climate justice, which might help mitigate some of these weaknesses.</p><p>One of the most promising opportunities is community-driven AI. Local communities worldwide are taking the lead in developing their own toolsadapting AI to Indigenous knowledge, cultural values and local priorities. For example, in Pacific Island states, community-driven drone programs closely track erosion and provide guidance for adaptation. In Canada, First Nations data sovereignty initiatives are ensuring environmental models serve their communities, not surveil them.</p><p>Another opportunity is policy integration. AI can inform the entire spectrum of policy from zoning laws to carbon taxes, if it is embedded in transparent and responsible processes. Some cities are already using AI to plan cooling systems in heat-prone neighborhoods, targeting investments where they are likely most effective. Others include emissions forecasts in building codes or subsidies to farmers.</p><p>Additionally, researchers and activists from various countries are getting together to co-create tools and datasets to combat digital colonialism by facilitating a bidirectional knowledge exchange. Predictive applications can anticipate disease outbreaks following floods, track hotspots of food insecurity and even project climate-induced migration flows. If paired with social services and policy responses, such indicators could shift climate action from the reactive to the preventive.</p><p>Increased investment in justice-led innovation marks another turning point. Venture and philanthropic firms are backing projects that put equity to the forefrom refugee camp sensors powered by the sun to climate finance algorithms that factor in social vulnerability. With the right guardrails in place, these investments could catalyze a new wave of inclusive technology.</p><p>But we cannot forget the many risks.</p><p>Digital colonialism is pervasive. Too often, AI tools created in the Global North are dispatched in bulk to the Global South with little regard for local context. This action subverts native expertise and imposes untested standards. The model in which data flows north, choices are made remotely, and communities have very little to say is clearly flawed and needs to be replaced with a co-produced and co-created one.</p><p>Surveillance and displacement issues are cause for great concern. Technologies such as drone surveillance and geospatial tracking can be used against the very individuals they are supposed to safeguardenabling evictions, policing traditional land use and criminalizing dissent. In addition, accountability diminishes when monitoring overreaches, and mechanisms for guaranteeing fairness in algorithmic decision-making are absent. This can lead to the risk of techno-solutionism (simplifying complicated societal problems into algorithms and apps), implicitly sidestepping the necessity for human action, framing climate change as purely a data issue and removing all other dimensions.</p><p>No algorithm, no matter how sophisticated, can substitute human action and interaction. Simply digitizing knowledge for extraction without prioritizing values does not lead to real progress. In this regard, the next decade will be crucial. With climate hazards intensifying and AI systems becoming more powerful, the echo of our choices will shape the future more and more.</p><p>We can choose how AI and climate justice interact. To make that choice wisely, we must listen not only to the facts; we also need to realize that climate change is more than a data problemit is a humanitarian and social crisis. To leverage AI technology properly, we need to regulate activities we know are harmful to society and to the most vulnerable, and we need to start co-creating new tools that include the voices of those who are too commonly marginalized.

Poor health outcomes on the continent are often, and rightly so, linked to other issues like funding, infrastructure, and policy issues. However, climate change is becoming an undeniable threat to our fundamental right to health as Africans. The climate crisis imposes additional health burdens on the world's most vulnerable populations, such as people in low-income communities, women, and children. To protect people's rights to health, governments and other stakeholders must work to mainstream climate justice and centre human rights and equity in health policy-making. Additionally, governments must prioritise justice in climate mitigation and adaptation strategies at all levels and strengthen climate financing for public health uses.\u00a0<br/>Climate change events adversely affect not just mortality and morbidity rates across the continent but also our health systems and infrastructure. Increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, air pollution, water scarcity, and reduced food production are all climate-related hazards that impact health outcomes and overwhelm already fragile healthcare systems on the continent.\u00a0<br/>A World Health Organization assessment concluded that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year, with between US$ 2-4 billion worth of direct damage costs to health by 2030. Climate change represents a significant public health burden to Africans, even though the continent contributes the least to global greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>Hence, it has become imperative to focus on climate justice as a critical factor in improving public health in Africa.\u00a0<br/>Climate justice is based on the idea that those who have historically contributed the most to climate change should bear the most responsibility for mitigating its impact. And this must be at the heart of Africa's public health reforms.\u00a0<br/>The concept of climate justice has been codified into the legal regime on the environment. Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration introduces the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.\u00a0<br/>This principle acknowledges that every country has a common responsibility to protect the environment. However, countries contributing more to climate change have a greater responsibility to reduce their carbon emissions. These countries must also acknowledge the special needs and interests of developing economies negatively impacted by climate change and make financial contributions towards climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.\u00a0<br/>At the core of climate justice is climate finance. Developed nations pledged in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion annually by 2020. This benchmark was achieved in 2022. However, a good percentage of this funding is non-concessional loans rather than grants. Without the necessary funds, countries most impacted by the climate crisis cannot rebuild and improve their climate resiliency.\u00a0<br/>It is also important to advocate not just for the availability of funds but also for climate finance to be tied to realising public health objectives in Africa. This can take the form of promoting and investing in sustainable practices within the health system such as adopting energy-efficient infrastructure and renewable energy sources and introducing waste reduction protocols within the system that do not compromise quality of care for patients.\u00a0<br/>Also, attaching health welfare initiatives and conditional cash transfers to climate objectives can help promote climate justice at all levels of care particularly at the primary healthcare level. For example, patients can be encouraged to recycle plastic waste in exchange for malaria medications or free consultations at health facilities in their communities.\u00a0<br/>Africa's peculiar vulnerability to climate change is tied to underlying socio-economic inequalities. Poverty, political instability, and weak infrastructure make it harder for communities in Africa to recover from climate shocks. Add that to the lasting impact of global inequalities and the continued mindless extraction of natural resources on the continent to fulfill capitalist wants, and it is clear why African communities face greater risks with fewer resources to adapt.<br/>According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 17 out of the 20 countries most threatened by climate change are in Africa. \u00a0Climate justice lies in recognising these inequalities and adopting equitable strategies to reduce their impact. To improve public health, climate adaptation and mitigation strategies must be integrated into health policies. Climate mitigation efforts that impact community resources like land and people's livelihoods must be implemented with the input of the community, bearing in mind how losses of livelihood and other social injustices can negatively impact health. \u00a0<br/>Health outcomes in Africa remain one of the worst globally, and climate change continues to worsen the situation. Integrating climate solutions into public health reforms will help improve public health and protect everyone's right to health and a safe environment.\u00a0<br/>T\u00e8m\u00edt??p??

Climate change events adversely affect not just mortality and morbidity rates across the continent but also our health systems and infrastructure.", "A World Health Organization assessment concluded that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year, with between US$ 2-4 billion worth of direct damage costs to health by 2030. Climate change represents a significant public health burden to Africans, even though the continent contributes the least to global greenhouse gas emissions. Climate justice is based on the idea that those who have historically contributed the most to climate change should bear the most responsibility for mitigating its impact. And this must be at the heart of Africa's public health reforms.", "Climate change represents a significant public health burden to Africans, even though the continent contributes the least to global greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, it has become imperative to focus on climate justice as a critical factor in improving public health in Africa. And this must be at the heart of Africa's public health reforms. The concept of climate justice has been codified into the legal regime on the environment.", "Climate justice is based on the idea that those who have historically contributed the most to climate change should bear the most responsibility for mitigating its impact. And this must be at the heart of Africa's public health reforms. Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration introduces the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This principle acknowledges that every country has a common responsibility to protect the environment.", "However, countries contributing more to climate change have a greater responsibility to reduce their carbon emissions. These countries must also acknowledge the special needs and interests of developing economies negatively impacted by climate change and make financial contributions towards climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. Developed nations pledged in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion annually by 2020. This benchmark was achieved in 2022.", "It is also important to advocate not just for the availability of funds but also for climate finance to be tied to realising public health objectives in Africa. This can take the form of promoting and investing in sustainable practices within the health system such as adopting energy-efficient infrastructure and renewable energy sources and introducing waste reduction protocols within the system that do not compromise quality of care for patients. For example, patients can be encouraged to recycle plastic waste in exchange for malaria medications or free consultations at health facilities in their communities. Africa's peculiar vulnerability to climate change is tied to underlying socio-economic inequalities.", "Add that to the lasting impact of global inequalities and the continued mindless extraction of natural resources on the continent to fulfill capitalist wants, and it is clear why African communities face greater risks with fewer resources to adapt. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 17 out of the 20 countries most threatened by climate change are in Africa. To improve public health, climate adaptation and mitigation strategies must be integrated into health policies. Climate mitigation efforts that impact community resources like land and people's livelihoods must be implemented with the input of the community, bearing in mind how losses of livelihood and other social injustices can negatively impact health."]}, {"relevance_score": 17, "title": "Media Advisory -- The Road to Belem: Climate Justice Not Delay", "published": "2025-06-23", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">[Category: Energy]-- 350.org, an organization that works to end the age of fossil fuels and build a community-led renewable energy, posted the following news release:</p><p>* * *</p><p>Media Advisory -- The Road to Belem: Climate Justice Not Delay</p><p>*</p><p>23 JUNE 2025</p><p>Media Advisory</p><p># Press conference: The Road to Belem: Climate Justice Not Delay</p><p>When: 23rd June, 3:30pm Bonn time</p><p>Where: Bonn Climate Talks, Nairobi Room 4, Main Building, Entrance Level</p><p>This press conference brings together powerful voices from across the climate justice movement to hold the COP Presidency accountable to the promises of ambition, equity, and implementation in the COP30 agenda.</p><p>We are here today, at the Bonn climate talks, to respond to the COP Presidency's plenary address and demand a clear pathway to a renewable energy future driven by people power, not fossil fuel interests.

The consequences will ripple into every zip code, threatening public health and safety nationwide.</p><p>The bills also include dangerous language that could legislate discrimination. \"Slashing funds that support climate and clean energy projects for Indigenous Peoples, Black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islander, and poor white communities serves absolutely no one and will only make us sicker. At the same time, the bills prohibit funds for diversity, equity and inclusion while essentially giving a green light to discriminate against LGBTQI+ people in the name of religious freedom. This is a violation of human rights and a show of lack of decency and must be opposed in the strongest of terms,\" said KD Chavez, CJA executive director.</p><p>If these provisions are included in the final FY26 appropriations package, community health and wealth will be sacrificed for polluters' profits. Chronic illness rates are likely to rise, especially for those living in close proximity to industry, airports, shipping ports, and vehicle distribution centers and routes. Weakening agencies like the EPA and dismantling foundational environmental protections will only saddle families with higher medical costs.</p><p>The proposed sweeping rollbacks of the EPA and vital environmental and public health protections violate our rights. Gutting programs that ensure communities have access to clean air, water, and land breaches the EPA's mission and the obligation of the agency and administration to safeguard our health and environment.</p><p>As if it weren't enough, the rollbacks remove accountability for polluters at the expense of our rights, health, Indigenous sovereignty, and future. This is another token prize to shield polluters from accountability and fill billionaires' pockets at the expense of our home, Mother Earth, and human dignity.</p><p>Additionally, by opening up the public lands-including sacred sites and protected areas stewarded by Indigenous communities- to fossil fuel companies for expanded mining, drilling and extraction, lawmakers are not only accelerating the climate crisis, but also violating Tribal sovereignty and desecrating lands that hold deep cultural and spiritual significance. These actions raise utility costs for hard-working families while enriching polluters. Instead of providing giveaways to the fossil fuel industry, Congress should be safeguarding public health, respecting Indigenous rights, and investing in safe, reliable, community-led renewable energy solutions.</p><p>These anti-people, anti-environment riders have no place in any final appropriations bill and must be rejected.

In moments of alignment, their fields reinforce each other, giving new vitality and perspective.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet not all orbits are stable and the gravitational field of AI is growing at an accelerated pace. The ultimate danger we face is the potential for AI to swallow everything around it, much like a black hole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AI has the potential to illuminate patterns in climate data, sharpen models and increase our chances to forecast an uncertain future. Yet there is a justified concern over the carbon footprint of big AI model training, the secrecy surrounding it, and the risk of exclusion--particularly with communities already on the fringes of both climate and tech discourse. The risk is that AI becomes the superstar rather than co-star, disrupting the equilibrium of the whole system. The question, therefore, is not whether or not these two spheres can coexist, but whether or not they can do so in mutually reinforcing terms.</p><p>In this time of rapid information consumption, one of the greatest challenges may simply be to open the door to conversation. In other words, not to idealize or dismiss AI, but to collaborate on conventions, best practices and boundaries that will govern its development within the climate realm in general and climate justice more specifically. Indifference can relegate the silent stakeholder to the sidelines, and the climate community could miss an opportunity to be fully engaged in what could possibly be one of the most transformative developments of our era.</p><p>Understanding where climate justice and AI meet should not be a pure academic exercise either. It should require dialogue that flows between technical, ethical, community, policy, political, environmental and social spaces. The effort should be rooted in the needs of the day-to-day lives of people most vulnerable to both climate hazards and technological exclusion.</p><p>In an initial effort to try to understand the relationships and tensions between AI and climate justice, we can use a popular strategist's toolkit: the SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis. By examining AI and climate justice in the context of this analysis, we can start exploring what this relationship might look like.</p><p>AI's ability to quickly process massive, unrelated datasets, from weather patterns to social media sentiment, is transforming climate work across different fields. Emergency responders can use AI to optimize response times following hurricanes or wildfires. In Southeast Asia and East Africa, AI-powered early warning systems are already saving lives. Satellite imagery that once took weeks to process can now be assessed in hours. As a consequence, deforestation in the Amazon, coastal erosion in Bangladesh and methane flares in Texas are all being tracked with unprecedented precision.</p><p>The benefits of AI, however, are not evenly distributed and are counterbalanced by evident weaknesses. One of the many problems is data imbalance, as some of the communities most vulnerable to climate change--such as Indigenous and rural farming communities--are not properly represented in the data that AI uses. These omissions can lead to considerable bias: for example, a flood simulation program that is ignorant of the topography of slums could underestimate the potential hazards involved; likewise, a wildfire model that lacks understanding of traditional land management may overlook essential firebreaks.</p><p>It is also costly to train large AI models, requiring computer power, electricity, broadband connectivity and skills. These conditions are unaffordable for most nations in the Global South, as well as for local communities in the Global North. AI is, in this case, a luxury.</p><p>Additionally, AI's unexplainability--or its \"black box\" status--raises issues of accountability. If AI is used to decide where adaptation finance should be invested, or whose communities should be evacuated, stakeholders need to be able to question those decisions. But if the models can't explain how and why they're reaching certain conclusions, how can they be trusted, or challenged?</p><p>And then there's the environmental cost. In an ironic twist, training AI models takes vast amounts of energy--energy that is often generated by fossil fuels. Research shows that building one advanced language model can create as much carbon as five cars emit during their lifetimes. If AI is to be part of the climate solution, it first needs to fix its own contribution to the problem.</p><p>Yet there are also numerous opportunities to use AI for climate justice, which might help mitigate some of these weaknesses.</p><p>One of the most promising opportunities is community-driven AI. Local communities worldwide are taking the lead in developing their own tools--adapting AI to Indigenous knowledge, cultural values and local priorities. For example, in Pacific Island states, community-driven drone programs closely track erosion and provide guidance for adaptation. In Canada, First Nations data sovereignty initiatives are ensuring environmental models serve their communities, not surveil them.</p><p>Another opportunity is policy integration. AI can inform the entire spectrum of policy from zoning laws to carbon taxes, if it is embedded in transparent and responsible processes. Some cities are already using AI to plan cooling systems in heat-prone neighborhoods, targeting investments where they are likely most effective. Others include emissions forecasts in building codes or subsidies to farmers.</p><p>Additionally, researchers and activists from various countries are getting together to co-create tools and datasets to combat digital colonialism by facilitating a bidirectional knowledge exchange. Predictive applications can anticipate disease outbreaks following floods, track hotspots of food insecurity and even project climate-induced migration flows. If paired with social services and policy responses, such indicators could shift climate action from the reactive to the preventive.</p><p>Increased investment in justice-led innovation marks another turning point. Venture and philanthropic firms are backing projects that put equity to the fore--from refugee camp sensors powered by the sun to climate finance algorithms that factor in social vulnerability. With the right guardrails in place, these investments could catalyze a new wave of inclusive technology.</p><p>But we cannot forget the many risks.</p><p>Digital colonialism is pervasive. Too often, AI tools created in the Global North are dispatched in bulk to the Global South with little regard for local context. This action subverts native expertise and imposes untested standards. The model in which data flows north, choices are made remotely, and communities have very little to say is clearly flawed and needs to be replaced with a co-produced and co-created one.</p><p>Surveillance and displacement issues are cause for great concern. Technologies such as drone surveillance and geospatial tracking can be used against the very individuals they are supposed to safeguard--enabling evictions, policing traditional land use and criminalizing dissent. In addition, accountability diminishes when monitoring overreaches, and mechanisms for guaranteeing fairness in algorithmic decision-making are absent. This can lead to the risk of techno-solutionism (simplifying complicated societal problems into algorithms and apps), implicitly sidestepping the necessity for human action, framing climate change as purely a data issue and removing all other dimensions.</p><p>No algorithm, no matter how sophisticated, can substitute human action and interaction. Simply digitizing knowledge for extraction without prioritizing values does not lead to real progress. In this regard, the next decade will be crucial. With climate hazards intensifying and AI systems becoming more powerful, the echo of our choices will shape the future more and more.</p><p>We can choose how AI and climate justice interact. To make that choice wisely, we must listen not only to the facts; we also need to realize that climate change is more than a data problem--it is a humanitarian and social crisis. To leverage AI technology properly, we need to regulate activities we know are harmful to society and to the most vulnerable, and we need to start co-creating new tools that include the voices of those who are too commonly marginalized. Artificial intelligence helps us expand our rational intelligence beyond limits that we would have never imagined even a few years ago.

The abrupt cancellation of these funds has caused widespread disruption to ongoing projects and left many organizations struggling to move forward without the promised financial support. The Environmental Protection Network, for example, lost nearly $2 million in grant funding that supported staffing and resources for its pro bono technical assistance work. This funding allowed the Environmental Protection Network to connect approximately 2,000 communities with EPA alumni volunteers, providing free expert guidance and support to these communities to access cleaner air and water while strengthening their resilience to climate change.</p><p>\"The Environmental Protection Network stands with our partners, colleagues and communities across the country who have been harmed by the unlawful termination of these critical grants,\" said Michelle Roos, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Network. \"These projects were funded to address long-standing environmental and health inequities in vulnerable communities. The administration's actions put the health and well-being of communities in jeopardy, and we fully support the fight to restore these grants and continue this important work.\"</p><p>Roos also submitted a declaration to the court in support of the lawsuit in which she highlighted that EPA's actions left hundreds of grantees struggling to understand why their funding was abruptly frozen or terminated.

Featuring several panels from NYC-EJA faculty, its fellowship members, representatives from partner organizations, plus interactive presentations from many members and community partners, the event served to raise awareness about the climate crisis, what The Hub and its partners have done to improve its impact on people's daily lives, especially in marginalized and low-income communities, and what can be done to ensure a more just future. Climate justice itself is an often overlooked aspect of the effects of climate change, and these issues, unlike disasters, can be felt every day. While strides have been made to address these issues, the people and their communities continue to fight for change, and for previous changes to remain. As NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said, \"The gains we fought for, and won, are being erased,\" so fighting, particularly by the people that live in these communities, is more important than ever.</p><p>A huge part of the Climate Justice Hub's mission is to change the way these communities are supported. \"It was started to offer a kind of corrective to the ways that universities and colleges typically interact with community organizations,\" Kobie Coleman, professor at Brooklyn College and the classes and curriculum lead of The Hub, told The Meridian. \"There have been partnerships between schools and the communities served before, but those partnerships often went one way.\"</p><p>By providing the tools for change directly to communities, people are empowered from within rather than relying on outside forces. This is especially true for matters of climate justice, where a lack of grassroots resources has often exacerbated these issues in a city already teeming with them.

This is particularly critical as a May 2025 WHYY report noted Philadelphia received failing grades for air quality from the American Lung Association, with particle pollution and ozone levels posing significant health risks, especially in neighborhoods along highways. The WHYY report also highlighted that people of color are more than twice as likely to live in places with failing pollution measures.</p><p>* Developing Community-Specific High Heat Index Solutions: Implementing both immediate and long-term strategies to combat extreme heat in vulnerable neighborhoods. Philadelphia's urban heat island effect, as detailed by WHYY in July 2023 (and corroborated by ongoing studies), can make some built environments up to 12 degrees Fahrenheit hotter, with areas like North and South Philadelphia often bearing the brunt. The PCJC urges solutions that resonate with community needs, connecting heat exposure to both acute and chronic health conditions.</p><p>* Focusing Climate Solutions on Equity and Justice: Prioritizing investments and interventions in communities historically divested from and most vulnerable to climate change, thereby reversing traditional approaches that often perpetuate disparities.</p><p>* Addressing Deteriorating Infrastructure: Recognizing and tackling the environmental and health impacts of aging infrastructure, such as lead in water pipelines, which disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities often co-located with former industrial sites.</p><p>The PCJC's work, supported by the Waverley Street Foundation, underscores the importance of participatory methods and power-sharing in community-university partnerships. The collective now plans to translate these community-forged recommendations into actionable policy, funding initiatives, and public awareness campaigns aimed at local and state policymakers. The Grid Magazine reported in April 2025 on the PCJC's efforts, highlighting the extensive community outreach undertaken to inform these recommendations, which tackle issues from illegal dumping to environmental inequity.

I see your invitation as a tribute to UN staff working around the world for human rights and for justice. And I see it as a reflection of our shared, fundamental conviction in the equal dignity and worth of every person -- a founding principle of both our organizations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One morning in the early '60s, a British lawyer opened his newspaper on his way to work. It reported that the dictatorship then ruling my country -- Portugal -- had imprisoned two students. Their crime: raising a toast to freedom. The barrister -- Peter Benenson -- was so outraged by their plight that he launched a global movement. And Amnesty International was founded.</p><p>And ever since, you have been at the forefront of the global struggle for human rights -- fearless, principled and relentless: Campaigning to free prisoners of conscience around the world. Contributing to the establishment of a number of international institutions and the conclusion of a number of treaties -- including the Convention Against Torture. Defending the full spectrum of human rights -- civil, political, social, economic and cultural. Winning landmark victories for justice -- and earning the Nobel Peace Prize along the way.</p><p>The work of Amnesty International reflects truths I lived under dictatorship: that morality demands the courage to stand against oppression; that solidarity and justice are both personal and global; and that the fight for freedom on one continent can reverberate across the globe. I saw this first-hand -- when liberation struggles in Africa helped end Portugal's authoritarian rule.</p><p>Today, all these truths are more important than ever. Because powerful forces are ranged against human rights -- and against the international system built to protect and uphold them. We see attacks on the International Criminal Court. Attacks on the international human rights system and its representatives. And flagrant violations of international law: from the horrors in Sudan and beyond to Russia's invasion in Ukraine where we need a just and lasting peace based on the UN Charter, international law and UN resolutions. And, of course, the relentless Israeli onslaught on Gaza.</p><p>I commend Amnesty International for your strong voices. From the beginning, I have repeatedly condemned the horrific 7 October terror attacks by Hamas. But nothing can justify the explosion of death and destruction since. The scale and scope is beyond anything we have seen in recent times.</p><p>I cannot explain the level of indifference and inaction we see by too many in the international community. The lack of compassion. The lack of truth. The lack of humanity. Our own heroic staff continue to serve in unimaginable conditions. Many are so numb and depleted that they say they feel neither dead nor alive. Children speaking of wanting to go to heaven, because at least, they say, there is food there.</p><p>We hold video calls with our own humanitarians who are starving before our eyes. This is not just a humanitarian crisis. It is a moral crisis that challenges the global conscience. We will continue to speak out at every opportunity. But words don't feed hungry children.</p><p>The United Nations stands ready to make the most of a possible ceasefire to dramatically scale up humanitarian operations across the Gaza Strip, as we successfully did during the previous pause in fighting. Our plans are ready, and they are finalized. We know what works -- and we know what does not.</p><p>Since 27 May, the United Nations has recorded over 1,000 Palestinians killed trying to access food. Let me repeat: 1,000 people -- killed not in combat, but in desperation -- while the entire population starves.</p><p>We need action. An immediate and permanent ceasefire. The immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access. At the same time, we need urgent, concrete and irreversible steps towards a two-State solution.</p><p>We are in a global battle for human dignity. For human rights. For justice. For the multilateral system itself. Amnesty International is indispensable in that fight.</p><p>So, my central message to you today is this: the world needs you more than ever. We need your courage, your creativity, and your clarity. We need your movements -- rooted in communities and rising from the ground up -- making it clear that leaders cannot turn a blind eye to their obligations.</p><p>And, yes, we need what you've called \"troublemaking\". The kind that challenges complacency and inaction. That exposes injustice. That drives lasting change. Because as I scan the global landscape, I see too many leaders who view human rights as the problem.</p><p>But we know human rights are the solution. They are the foundation of peace. They are the engine of progress. And they are the path out of conflict and chaos to security and hope. You know better than anyone: this work is never easy. And the struggle is always hardest when it matters most -- when the urgency is greatest and the stakes are highest.</p><p>But I want to assure you: you are not alone. Human rights are -- and will remain -- a central pillar of the United Nations. Despite financial challenges, we are determined to reinforce human rights for the twenty-first century. The UN80 initiative, grounded in the UN Charter and international law, is aimed at strengthening our core work across peace, human rights and development. And our Call to Action for Human Rights is mobilizing every part of the UN system.</p><p>In the face of crisis, we must stand together -- and act together. Let me turn to your focus for this year's Global Assembly: confronting the rise of authoritarian practices -- and advancing climate justice.</p><p>First -- authoritarianism. Around the world, we are witnessing a surge in repressive tactics aiming at corroding respect for human rights. And these are contaminating some democracies. This is not a series of isolated events. It is a global contagion. Political opposition crushed. Accountability dismantled. Equality and non-discrimination trampled. The rule of law cast aside.</p><p>On the other hand, civil society -- the lifeblood of any free nation -- is suffocated. We see activists and journalists silenced -- even murdered. Minorities scapegoated. Women and girls stripped of their most basic rights -- most brutally in Afghanistan. And all of this is amplified by digital technology.</p><p>We must right these wrongs. Many countries we must recognize stand firm with human rights. And we must push all countries to defend them -- consistently, and universally, even -- or especially -- when inconvenient. We must urge them to protect and strengthen the international human rights system. We must demand accountability for human rights violations -- without fear or favour. And insist that countries honour commitments in the Pact of the Future -- to protect civic space and uphold human rights and gender equality.</p><p>We must also demand action to confront the flood of lies and hate polluting our digital spaces. Social media manipulation has become a powerful weapon in the authoritarian playbook. Many algorithms are boosting the worst of humanity -- rewarding falsehoods, fuelling racism and misogyny and deepening division.</p><p>Last year, countries took steps to tackle these issues. They adopted in the UN General Assembly the Global Digital Compact -- committing to apply human rights to cyberspace -- and to protect information integrity. Now we must hold them to it.</p><p>And we must go further -- to rebuild trust in the international system by grounding it in justice, inclusion and results. That means reforming the United Nations Security Council. It is a scandal that Africa still has no permanent seat at the table. It means delivering on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.</p><p>And it means transforming the international financial system -- with debt relief, a surge in development finance, and a stronger voice and greater participation for developing countries in international financial institutions. I applaud your work on such issues, including through the 2048 Commission -- helping to shape a fairer, more inclusive global order.</p><p>The second focus of this Global Assembly is one of the defining struggles of our time: securing climate justice. The climate crisis is not just an environmental emergency. It is a human rights catastrophe. We must confront and correct the deep injustices it has laid bare: The poor, the vulnerable and the marginalized -- suffering most from a crisis they did nothing to create.</p><p>Environmental defenders -- arrested, threatened, and even killed for protecting communities and ecosystems. Land and livelihoods -- plundered in the race for minerals critical to clean energy. And climate finance -- still wholly inadequate as fossil fuels are propped up by subsidies as others pay the price. All while their political enablers stall and sabotage action.</p><p>But we have seen what people power can achieve: from Amnesty's role in promoting international recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment to legal victories that have led courts to clarify States' obligations on climate.</p><p>Just two days ago, the International Court of Justice issued a historic advisory opinion. It made clear that States are obliged to protect the global climate system, that climate change is a human rights issue. And that the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius must guide climate policies, in accordance with the Paris Agreement. We have young Pacific Islanders to thank for this landmark victory.</p><p>And all of us must build on these hard-won gains -- by insisting on legal accountability and demanding climate justice. That means the biggest economies and emitters leading an urgent global reduction in emissions, and a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>New national climate action plans -- or NDCs - must align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. They must respect human rights. And they must be shaped in partnership with those most affected -- especially marginalized groups.</p><p>We also need action on critical minerals -- to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and front-line communities. We cannot accept a clean energy future built on dirty practices with enormous violations of human rights and many times of human rights of children. Our United Nations Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals has laid out a path -- placing human rights at the core of the critical mineral value chains. We are working with partners to deliver.</p><p>And we need finance -- real finance -- for developing countries to cut emissions, adapt to climate shocks, and recover from loss and damage. We must push governments to provide funds they have pledged. And explore new sources of finance -- including putting an effective price on carbon and establishing solidarity levies on polluting sectors and industries.</p><p>As a young man living under dictatorship in Portugal I learned -- as Amnesty's founders knew -- that standing up for freedom is standing on the right side of history.</p><p>And today, I am more certain than ever: When you stand for human rights, you stand with what is right. That is your history. When Amnesty was founded in the '60s the fight for a fairer world was raging: for civil rights; for women's rights; for liberation from colonial rule.</p><p>These causes once seemed a distant dream. So did Portuguese democracy. I can assure you that your courage continues to change lives. Your persistence is shifting the course of history. Let's keep going. Let's keep fighting. Let's meet this moment with the urgency it demands. And let's never, ever give up.</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention and your patience.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://press.un.org/en/2025/sgsm22740.doc.htm\">https://press.un.org/en/2025/sgsm22740.doc.htm</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9345725 MSTRUCK</p>", "publisher": "Targeted News Service", "instances": ["I see your invitation as a tribute to UN staff working around the world for human rights and for justice.

The decision sets transnational standards that could shape legal jurisprudence in courts across the world. </p><p>Responding to the Advisory Opinion, Ana Piquer, Regional Director for the Americas at Amnesty International, stated: </p><p>'Each day of inaction means more suffering for the people and communities who have contributed the least to the climate crisis. Today, therefore, marks a moment of hope for millions of people in the Americas whose human rights are being devastated by this crisis. States now have clear guidance and can no longer claim ignorance of their human rights obligations. The roadmap is set - now is the time for immediate, concrete, and positive action to urgently tackle the climate crisis.' </p><p>The Court emphasized that the climate crisis does not affect all people equally. In the Americas and globally, Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendant communities, rural and fishing populations, women, children, older persons, and socioeconomically marginalized groups face disproportionate impacts. The Court ruled on the specific duties of states to prevent harm and ensure protection for these groups, affirming that climate action is a human rights obligation - not a political choice. </p><p>In this context, Mandi Mudarikwa, Head of Strategic Litigation at Amnesty International, emphasized: 'Today, the Inter-American Court affirmed and clarified the obligations of states to respect, ensure, prevent, and cooperate in order to realize human rights in the context of the climate crisis. Crucially, the Court recognized the autonomous right to a healthy climate for both individuals and communities, linked to the right to a healthy environment. The Court also underscored the obligation of states to protect cross-border climate-displaced persons, including through the issuance of humanitarian visas and protection from deportation.' </p><p>This Advisory Opinion is a significant contribution to the ongoing development and clarification of states' human rights obligations in the face of climate change. Amnesty International looks forward with great interest to future decisions resulting from advisory opinions to be issued by the International Court of Justice later this year, as well as from other regional courts, domestic courts, and quasi-judicial bodies. </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>The request for this advisory opinion was submitted by the governments of Chile and Colombia in January 2023, seeking clarification on states' obligations in the face of the climate emergency under international human rights law. Public hearings were held in Barbados (April 2024) and Brazil (May 2024), with unprecedented civil society participation. Amnesty International submitted a legal brief to the Court as amicus curiae, providing legal analysis on human rights and climate change. </p><p>This is the second authoritative advisory opinion on climate change. One year ago, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) issued a landmark advisory opinion on states' obligations to mitigate climate change, particularly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). </p>", "publisher": "ASEAN Tribune", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 10, "title": "ECOACTION 2025: FAITH, ART, AND THE FIGHT FOR CLIMATE JUSTICE", "published": "2025-04-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following information was released by Fordham University:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:00:00 -0600</p><p>Our planet finds itself in a moment requiring action.

With the passage of the Community Benefit Fund (Senate Bill 48) and the Innovation in State Government Fund (Senate Bill 83), the state is proving that smart, community-driven climate action isn't just possible - it's already happening.</p><p>These wins are the result of years of hard work by advocates, lawmakers and New Mexicans from across the state who believe in a future where clean energy, good jobs and resilient communities go hand in hand. The Community Benefit Fund is a groundbreaking initiative that puts real money into local projects that create jobs, expand clean energy and equip communities to build resilience in the face of climate challenges and adapt to climate changes. Whether it's building energy-efficient homes, strengthening disaster response centers or bringing reliable solar and wind power to rural areas, this fund will make a tangible difference in people's lives.</p><p>The Innovation in Government Act will help state agencies tackle climate change head-on by giving them the tools and resources they need to plan for the future. Having strong policies is one thing - but making sure agencies have the funding and capacity to enforce them is just as important. Together, these two bills move New Mexico closer to a future where climate action is proactive rather than reactive.</p><p>As exciting as these wins are, New Mexicans know the fight isn't over. The next big challenge is getting enforceable, comprehensive climate pollution reduction targets ready to pass next session - and that work is underway. Recent polling shows that 77% of New Mexicans support the government taking action to reduce carbon and methane pollution that contribute to climate change. The need for action is increasingly urgent as the second Trump administration continues to prioritize corporate profits over the health and well-being of us all.</p><p>The Clear Horizons Act is the next major step. This bill establishes statewide limits on greenhouse gas emissions, holding polluters accountable and pushing New Mexico toward a carbon-free future.</p><p>While the Clear Horizons Act didn't make it through the Legislature this time, momentum is growing. Alongside the Clear Horizons Coalition, we will roll up our sleeves over the next year to make sure comprehensive climate pollution reduction targets cross the finish line next session.</p><p>Over the coming months, we'll bring together businesses, labor groups, tribal and Navajo leaders, and local communities to make the case that clean energy means good jobs, long-term savings and a safer future. We're committed to working together to refine the Clear Horizons Act to make sure it's ambitious, effective, achievable and focused on large source emitters - not everyday New Mexicans who rely on propane, wood burning stoves or make their living by ranching.</p><p>New Mexico has already shown what's possible with bold climate action - from the Energy Transition Act to the Community Benefit Fund.

Without this money, polluting industries couldn't continue on with business as usual.</p><p>Communities are demanding change from these financial giants. Chief among them is Vanguard, the world's No. 1 fossil fuel investor.</p><p>That's why AFSC has joined other organizations in the Vanguard S.O.S. campaign. We're asking people worldwide to boycott Vanguard until it stops funding fossil fuel projects and starts taking climate justice into account in its investment decisions.</p><p>Here are five ways you can help:</p><p>1. Sign the Never Vanguard Pledge.</p><p>Anyone can sign the Never Vanguard Pledge, whether you're a customer or not. By signing the pledge, you are taking a clear stance against doing business with Vanguard until it takes serious steps towards cleaning up its act.</p><p>The Vanguard S.O.S. campaign has already moved at least $55 million worth of investments away from Vanguard so far. With your help, we can grow that number.</p><p>Additionally, if you are a Vanguard customer who has decided to join the movement by withdrawing your funds, you can use this pledge response to indicate how much you've moved.</p><p>2. If you invest with Vanguard, learn how to move your money.</p><p>For those interested in withdrawing their investments from Vanguard, there are resources for you to learn more. Earth Quaker Action Team (EQAT), an environmental activist group and partner to AFSC in the Vanguard S.O.S. campaign, hosts \"Moving Money Out of Vanguard\" workshops to help you navigate through the process. To find EQAT's next webinar, check out their events page.</p><p>3. If you have a workplace retirement plan with Vanguard, talk with your co-workers and employer about moving it to another firm.</p><p>Your workplace may use Vanguard for retirement plans. Talk with co-workers about the opportunity to make a difference by demanding that Vanguard clean up its act. Consider asking your employer about switching to a different firm for your retirement plans, especially if you have significant support from your co-workers.</p><p>This article has useful tips for these conversations: do your homework, talk to colleagues face-to-face, tell stories about why this issue matters to you, appeal to shared values, and stay polite and positive!</p><p>4. Tell Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji to meet with the Vanguard S.O.S. campaign.</p><p>Despite the millions of dollars that the campaign has already moved out of Vanguard so far, Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji still won't meet with climate justice activists.

On top of that, newly marked-up appropriations bills pave the way for a level of harm we haven't seen in generations; a recipe for disaster is being legislated.</p><p>If enacted, these bills would mean devastation for millions of people. Communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis, and those already grappling with extreme weather, will see health, economic, and environmental conditions deteriorate further.</p><p>Rolling back critical protections, including vehicle and methane emissions regulations, sewage sludge risk assessments, regulations that address air pollution emissions from power plants and the crude oil and gas sectors, hazardous waste regulations, and vehicle emissions fuel standards, among many others, is ill-intentioned. The consequences will ripple into every zip code, threatening public health and safety nationwide.</p><p>The bills also include dangerous language that could legislate discrimination. \"Slashing funds that support climate and clean energy projects for Indigenous Peoples, Black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islander, and poor white communities serves absolutely no one and will only make us sicker. At the same time, the bills prohibit funds for diversity, equity and inclusion while essentially giving a green light to discriminate against LGBTQI+ people in the name of religious freedom. This is a violation of human rights and a show of lack of decency and must be opposed in the strongest of terms,\" said KD Chavez, CJA executive director.</p><p>If these provisions are included in the final FY26 appropriations package, community health and wealth will be sacrificed for polluters' profits. Chronic illness rates are likely to rise, especially for those living in close proximity to industry, airports, shipping ports, and vehicle distribution centers and routes. Weakening agencies like the EPA and dismantling foundational environmental protections will only saddle families with higher medical costs.</p><p>The proposed sweeping rollbacks of the EPA and vital environmental and public health protections violate our rights. Gutting programs that ensure communities have access to clean air, water, and land breaches the EPA's mission and the obligation of the agency and administration to safeguard our health and environment.</p><p>As if it weren't enough, the rollbacks remove accountability for polluters at the expense of our rights, health, Indigenous sovereignty, and future. This is another token prize to shield polluters from accountability and fill billionaires' pockets at the expense of our home, Mother Earth, and human dignity.</p><p>Additionally, by opening up the public lands-including sacred sites and protected areas stewarded by Indigenous communities- to fossil fuel companies for expanded mining, drilling and extraction, lawmakers are not only accelerating the climate crisis, but also violating Tribal sovereignty and desecrating lands that hold deep cultural and spiritual significance. These actions raise utility costs for hard-working families while enriching polluters. Instead of providing giveaways to the fossil fuel industry, Congress should be safeguarding public health, respecting Indigenous rights, and investing in safe, reliable, community-led renewable energy solutions.</p><p>These anti-people, anti-environment riders have no place in any final appropriations bill and must be rejected. The protection of our communities, our planet, and the sovereign rights of Indian Country are long overdue.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatejusticealliance.org/house-fy26-approps\">https://climatejusticealliance.org/house-fy26-approps</url>/</p><p>[Category: Environment]</p><p>Contact: Contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kayla@unbendablemedia.com\">kayla@unbendablemedia.com</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T83-SS-FR-9336815 T83-SS-FR</p>", "publisher": "Targeted News Service", "instances": ["On top of that, newly marked-up appropriations bills pave the way for a level of harm we haven't seen in generations; a recipe for disaster is being legislated.

In moments of alignment, their fields reinforce each other, giving new vitality and perspective.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet not all orbits are stable and the gravitational field of AI is growing at an accelerated pace. The ultimate danger we face is the potential for AI to swallow everything around it, much like a black hole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AI has the potential to illuminate patterns in climate data, sharpen models and increase our chances to forecast an uncertain future. Yet there is a justified concern over the carbon footprint of big AI model training, the secrecy surrounding it, and the risk of exclusion--particularly with communities already on the fringes of both climate and tech discourse. The risk is that AI becomes the superstar rather than co-star, disrupting the equilibrium of the whole system. The question, therefore, is not whether or not these two spheres can coexist, but whether or not they can do so in mutually reinforcing terms.</p><p>In this time of rapid information consumption, one of the greatest challenges may simply be to open the door to conversation. In other words, not to idealize or dismiss AI, but to collaborate on conventions, best practices and boundaries that will govern its development within the climate realm in general and climate justice more specifically. Indifference can relegate the silent stakeholder to the sidelines, and the climate community could miss an opportunity to be fully engaged in what could possibly be one of the most transformative developments of our era.</p><p>Understanding where climate justice and AI meet should not be a pure academic exercise either. It should require dialogue that flows between technical, ethical, community, policy, political, environmental and social spaces. The effort should be rooted in the needs of the day-to-day lives of people most vulnerable to both climate hazards and technological exclusion.</p><p>In an initial effort to try to understand the relationships and tensions between AI and climate justice, we can use a popular strategist's toolkit: the SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis. By examining AI and climate justice in the context of this analysis, we can start exploring what this relationship might look like.</p><p>AI's ability to quickly process massive, unrelated datasets, from weather patterns to social media sentiment, is transforming climate work across different fields. Emergency responders can use AI to optimize response times following hurricanes or wildfires. In Southeast Asia and East Africa, AI-powered early warning systems are already saving lives. Satellite imagery that once took weeks to process can now be assessed in hours. As a consequence, deforestation in the Amazon, coastal erosion in Bangladesh and methane flares in Texas are all being tracked with unprecedented precision.</p><p>The benefits of AI, however, are not evenly distributed and are counterbalanced by evident weaknesses. One of the many problems is data imbalance, as some of the communities most vulnerable to climate change--such as Indigenous and rural farming communities--are not properly represented in the data that AI uses. These omissions can lead to considerable bias: for example, a flood simulation program that is ignorant of the topography of slums could underestimate the potential hazards involved; likewise, a wildfire model that lacks understanding of traditional land management may overlook essential firebreaks.</p><p>It is also costly to train large AI models, requiring computer power, electricity, broadband connectivity and skills. These conditions are unaffordable for most nations in the Global South, as well as for local communities in the Global North. AI is, in this case, a luxury.</p><p>Additionally, AI's unexplainability--or its \"black box\" status--raises issues of accountability. If AI is used to decide where adaptation finance should be invested, or whose communities should be evacuated, stakeholders need to be able to question those decisions. But if the models can't explain how and why they're reaching certain conclusions, how can they be trusted, or challenged?</p><p>And then there's the environmental cost. In an ironic twist, training AI models takes vast amounts of energy--energy that is often generated by fossil fuels. Research shows that building one advanced language model can create as much carbon as five cars emit during their lifetimes. If AI is to be part of the climate solution, it first needs to fix its own contribution to the problem.</p><p>Yet there are also numerous opportunities to use AI for climate justice, which might help mitigate some of these weaknesses.</p><p>One of the most promising opportunities is community-driven AI. Local communities worldwide are taking the lead in developing their own tools--adapting AI to Indigenous knowledge, cultural values and local priorities. For example, in Pacific Island states, community-driven drone programs closely track erosion and provide guidance for adaptation. In Canada, First Nations data sovereignty initiatives are ensuring environmental models serve their communities, not surveil them.</p><p>Another opportunity is policy integration. AI can inform the entire spectrum of policy from zoning laws to carbon taxes, if it is embedded in transparent and responsible processes. Some cities are already using AI to plan cooling systems in heat-prone neighborhoods, targeting investments where they are likely most effective. Others include emissions forecasts in building codes or subsidies to farmers.</p><p>Additionally, researchers and activists from various countries are getting together to co-create tools and datasets to combat digital colonialism by facilitating a bidirectional knowledge exchange. Predictive applications can anticipate disease outbreaks following floods, track hotspots of food insecurity and even project climate-induced migration flows. If paired with social services and policy responses, such indicators could shift climate action from the reactive to the preventive.</p><p>Increased investment in justice-led innovation marks another turning point. Venture and philanthropic firms are backing projects that put equity to the fore--from refugee camp sensors powered by the sun to climate finance algorithms that factor in social vulnerability. With the right guardrails in place, these investments could catalyze a new wave of inclusive technology.</p><p>But we cannot forget the many risks.</p><p>Digital colonialism is pervasive. Too often, AI tools created in the Global North are dispatched in bulk to the Global South with little regard for local context. This action subverts native expertise and imposes untested standards. The model in which data flows north, choices are made remotely, and communities have very little to say is clearly flawed and needs to be replaced with a co-produced and co-created one.</p><p>Surveillance and displacement issues are cause for great concern. Technologies such as drone surveillance and geospatial tracking can be used against the very individuals they are supposed to safeguard--enabling evictions, policing traditional land use and criminalizing dissent. In addition, accountability diminishes when monitoring overreaches, and mechanisms for guaranteeing fairness in algorithmic decision-making are absent. This can lead to the risk of techno-solutionism (simplifying complicated societal problems into algorithms and apps), implicitly sidestepping the necessity for human action, framing climate change as purely a data issue and removing all other dimensions.</p><p>No algorithm, no matter how sophisticated, can substitute human action and interaction. Simply digitizing knowledge for extraction without prioritizing values does not lead to real progress. In this regard, the next decade will be crucial. With climate hazards intensifying and AI systems becoming more powerful, the echo of our choices will shape the future more and more.</p><p>We can choose how AI and climate justice interact. To make that choice wisely, we must listen not only to the facts; we also need to realize that climate change is more than a data problem--it is a humanitarian and social crisis. To leverage AI technology properly, we need to regulate activities we know are harmful to society and to the most vulnerable, and we need to start co-creating new tools that include the voices of those who are too commonly marginalized. Artificial intelligence helps us expand our rational intelligence beyond limits that we would have never imagined even a few years ago.

In this time of rapid information consumption, one of the greatest challenges may simply be to open the door to conversation. Indifference can relegate the silent stakeholder to the sidelines, and the climate community could miss an opportunity to be fully engaged in what could possibly be one of the most transformative developments of our era.

Featuring several panels from NYC-EJA faculty, its fellowship members, representatives from partner organizations, plus interactive presentations from many members and community partners, the event served to raise awareness about the climate crisis, what The Hub and its partners have done to improve its impact on people's daily lives, especially in marginalized and low-income communities, and what can be done to ensure a more just future. Climate justice itself is an often overlooked aspect of the effects of climate change, and these issues, unlike disasters, can be felt every day. While strides have been made to address these issues, the people and their communities continue to fight for change, and for previous changes to remain. As NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said, \"The gains we fought for, and won, are being erased,\" so fighting, particularly by the people that live in these communities, is more important than ever.</p><p>A huge part of the Climate Justice Hub's mission is to change the way these communities are supported. \"It was started to offer a kind of corrective to the ways that universities and colleges typically interact with community organizations,\" Kobie Coleman, professor at Brooklyn College and the classes and curriculum lead of The Hub, told The Meridian. \"There have been partnerships between schools and the communities served before, but those partnerships often went one way.\"</p><p>By providing the tools for change directly to communities, people are empowered from within rather than relying on outside forces.

Another central theme of the conference was raising awareness. A number of the student speakers made the point in saying that issues of climate/environmental justice were completely unknown to them until they got</p><p>directly involved. Alejandro Lozerno, a professor at John Jay College, said that when he taught his students about these issues, \"I saw a light bulb going off in their heads, like they had seen these kind of unfair distribution of harms and benefits across [their] communities, but they didn't have that language\".</p><p>\"When you invest in our power, you invest in our ability to fight.\"-- Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE, a Brooklyn based environmental organization</p><p>However, the most crucial takeaway from all of this was the power of organization.

This is particularly critical as a May 2025 WHYY report noted Philadelphia received failing grades for air quality from the American Lung Association, with particle pollution and ozone levels posing significant health risks, especially in neighborhoods along highways. The WHYY report also highlighted that people of color are more than twice as likely to live in places with failing pollution measures.</p><p>* Developing Community-Specific High Heat Index Solutions: Implementing both immediate and long-term strategies to combat extreme heat in vulnerable neighborhoods. Philadelphia's urban heat island effect, as detailed by WHYY in July 2023 (and corroborated by ongoing studies), can make some built environments up to 12 degrees Fahrenheit hotter, with areas like North and South Philadelphia often bearing the brunt. The PCJC urges solutions that resonate with community needs, connecting heat exposure to both acute and chronic health conditions.</p><p>* Focusing Climate Solutions on Equity and Justice: Prioritizing investments and interventions in communities historically divested from and most vulnerable to climate change, thereby reversing traditional approaches that often perpetuate disparities.</p><p>* Addressing Deteriorating Infrastructure: Recognizing and tackling the environmental and health impacts of aging infrastructure, such as lead in water pipelines, which disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities often co-located with former industrial sites.</p><p>The PCJC's work, supported by the Waverley Street Foundation, underscores the importance of participatory methods and power-sharing in community-university partnerships. The collective now plans to translate these community-forged recommendations into actionable policy, funding initiatives, and public awareness campaigns aimed at local and state policymakers. The Grid Magazine reported in April 2025 on the PCJC's efforts, highlighting the extensive community outreach undertaken to inform these recommendations, which tackle issues from illegal dumping to environmental inequity.

This article, grounded in a systematic review of the global literature, foregrounds the mechanisms through which heat functions as a site of socio-environmental injustice. We argue that fragmented urban morphologies, entrenched spatial inequalities, and uneven adaptation strategies collectively produce and sustain heat vulnerability. The article identifies three interrelated conceptual framings that elucidate the production and persistence of heat inequity: transitional injustice, green climate gentrification, and intersectional adaptation praxis. These lenses reveal how heat risk is differentially distributed, governed, and experienced with broader discourses of urban marginalisation, environmental dispossession, and epistemic exclusion. We contend that advancing climate justice in the context of urban heat requires moving beyond technocratic and elite-oriented adaptation, toward multi-scalar planning paradigms that recognise embodied vulnerability, structural inequality, and the socio-political ecologies of thermal exposure.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"By theorising urban heat through the lens of climate justice, this article contributes to a more expansive and critical understanding of urban climate risk, one that situates heat inequity within the broader structures of power, governance, and spatial exclusion shaping contemporary urban environments.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Climate Justice and Heat Inequity in Poor Urban Communities: The Lens of Transitional Justice, Green Climate Gentrification, and Adaptation Praxis.

I see your invitation as a tribute to UN staff working around the world for human rights and for justice. And I see it as a reflection of our shared, fundamental conviction in the equal dignity and worth of every person -- a founding principle of both our organizations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One morning in the early '60s, a British lawyer opened his newspaper on his way to work. It reported that the dictatorship then ruling my country -- Portugal -- had imprisoned two students. Their crime: raising a toast to freedom. The barrister -- Peter Benenson -- was so outraged by their plight that he launched a global movement. And Amnesty International was founded.</p><p>And ever since, you have been at the forefront of the global struggle for human rights -- fearless, principled and relentless: Campaigning to free prisoners of conscience around the world. Contributing to the establishment of a number of international institutions and the conclusion of a number of treaties -- including the Convention Against Torture. Defending the full spectrum of human rights -- civil, political, social, economic and cultural. Winning landmark victories for justice -- and earning the Nobel Peace Prize along the way.</p><p>The work of Amnesty International reflects truths I lived under dictatorship: that morality demands the courage to stand against oppression; that solidarity and justice are both personal and global; and that the fight for freedom on one continent can reverberate across the globe. I saw this first-hand -- when liberation struggles in Africa helped end Portugal's authoritarian rule.</p><p>Today, all these truths are more important than ever. Because powerful forces are ranged against human rights -- and against the international system built to protect and uphold them. We see attacks on the International Criminal Court. Attacks on the international human rights system and its representatives. And flagrant violations of international law: from the horrors in Sudan and beyond to Russia's invasion in Ukraine where we need a just and lasting peace based on the UN Charter, international law and UN resolutions. And, of course, the relentless Israeli onslaught on Gaza.</p><p>I commend Amnesty International for your strong voices. From the beginning, I have repeatedly condemned the horrific 7 October terror attacks by Hamas. But nothing can justify the explosion of death and destruction since. The scale and scope is beyond anything we have seen in recent times.</p><p>I cannot explain the level of indifference and inaction we see by too many in the international community. The lack of compassion. The lack of truth. The lack of humanity. Our own heroic staff continue to serve in unimaginable conditions. Many are so numb and depleted that they say they feel neither dead nor alive. Children speaking of wanting to go to heaven, because at least, they say, there is food there.</p><p>We hold video calls with our own humanitarians who are starving before our eyes. This is not just a humanitarian crisis. It is a moral crisis that challenges the global conscience. We will continue to speak out at every opportunity. But words don't feed hungry children.</p><p>The United Nations stands ready to make the most of a possible ceasefire to dramatically scale up humanitarian operations across the Gaza Strip, as we successfully did during the previous pause in fighting. Our plans are ready, and they are finalized. We know what works -- and we know what does not.</p><p>Since 27 May, the United Nations has recorded over 1,000 Palestinians killed trying to access food. Let me repeat: 1,000 people -- killed not in combat, but in desperation -- while the entire population starves.</p><p>We need action. An immediate and permanent ceasefire. The immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access. At the same time, we need urgent, concrete and irreversible steps towards a two-State solution.</p><p>We are in a global battle for human dignity. For human rights. For justice. For the multilateral system itself. Amnesty International is indispensable in that fight.</p><p>So, my central message to you today is this: the world needs you more than ever. We need your courage, your creativity, and your clarity. We need your movements -- rooted in communities and rising from the ground up -- making it clear that leaders cannot turn a blind eye to their obligations.</p><p>And, yes, we need what you've called \"troublemaking\". The kind that challenges complacency and inaction. That exposes injustice. That drives lasting change. Because as I scan the global landscape, I see too many leaders who view human rights as the problem.</p><p>But we know human rights are the solution. They are the foundation of peace. They are the engine of progress. And they are the path out of conflict and chaos to security and hope. You know better than anyone: this work is never easy. And the struggle is always hardest when it matters most -- when the urgency is greatest and the stakes are highest.</p><p>But I want to assure you: you are not alone. Human rights are -- and will remain -- a central pillar of the United Nations. Despite financial challenges, we are determined to reinforce human rights for the twenty-first century. The UN80 initiative, grounded in the UN Charter and international law, is aimed at strengthening our core work across peace, human rights and development. And our Call to Action for Human Rights is mobilizing every part of the UN system.</p><p>In the face of crisis, we must stand together -- and act together. Let me turn to your focus for this year's Global Assembly: confronting the rise of authoritarian practices -- and advancing climate justice.</p><p>First -- authoritarianism. Around the world, we are witnessing a surge in repressive tactics aiming at corroding respect for human rights. And these are contaminating some democracies. This is not a series of isolated events. It is a global contagion. Political opposition crushed. Accountability dismantled. Equality and non-discrimination trampled. The rule of law cast aside.</p><p>On the other hand, civil society -- the lifeblood of any free nation -- is suffocated. We see activists and journalists silenced -- even murdered. Minorities scapegoated. Women and girls stripped of their most basic rights -- most brutally in Afghanistan. And all of this is amplified by digital technology.</p><p>We must right these wrongs. Many countries we must recognize stand firm with human rights. And we must push all countries to defend them -- consistently, and universally, even -- or especially -- when inconvenient. We must urge them to protect and strengthen the international human rights system. We must demand accountability for human rights violations -- without fear or favour. And insist that countries honour commitments in the Pact of the Future -- to protect civic space and uphold human rights and gender equality.</p><p>We must also demand action to confront the flood of lies and hate polluting our digital spaces. Social media manipulation has become a powerful weapon in the authoritarian playbook. Many algorithms are boosting the worst of humanity -- rewarding falsehoods, fuelling racism and misogyny and deepening division.</p><p>Last year, countries took steps to tackle these issues. They adopted in the UN General Assembly the Global Digital Compact -- committing to apply human rights to cyberspace -- and to protect information integrity. Now we must hold them to it.</p><p>And we must go further -- to rebuild trust in the international system by grounding it in justice, inclusion and results. That means reforming the United Nations Security Council. It is a scandal that Africa still has no permanent seat at the table. It means delivering on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.</p><p>And it means transforming the international financial system -- with debt relief, a surge in development finance, and a stronger voice and greater participation for developing countries in international financial institutions. I applaud your work on such issues, including through the 2048 Commission -- helping to shape a fairer, more inclusive global order.</p><p>The second focus of this Global Assembly is one of the defining struggles of our time: securing climate justice. The climate crisis is not just an environmental emergency. It is a human rights catastrophe. We must confront and correct the deep injustices it has laid bare: The poor, the vulnerable and the marginalized -- suffering most from a crisis they did nothing to create.</p><p>Environmental defenders -- arrested, threatened, and even killed for protecting communities and ecosystems. Land and livelihoods -- plundered in the race for minerals critical to clean energy. And climate finance -- still wholly inadequate as fossil fuels are propped up by subsidies as others pay the price. All while their political enablers stall and sabotage action.</p><p>But we have seen what people power can achieve: from Amnesty's role in promoting international recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment to legal victories that have led courts to clarify States' obligations on climate.</p><p>Just two days ago, the International Court of Justice issued a historic advisory opinion. It made clear that States are obliged to protect the global climate system, that climate change is a human rights issue. And that the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius must guide climate policies, in accordance with the Paris Agreement. We have young Pacific Islanders to thank for this landmark victory.</p><p>And all of us must build on these hard-won gains -- by insisting on legal accountability and demanding climate justice. That means the biggest economies and emitters leading an urgent global reduction in emissions, and a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>New national climate action plans -- or NDCs - must align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. They must respect human rights. And they must be shaped in partnership with those most affected -- especially marginalized groups.</p><p>We also need action on critical minerals -- to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and front-line communities. We cannot accept a clean energy future built on dirty practices with enormous violations of human rights and many times of human rights of children. Our United Nations Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals has laid out a path -- placing human rights at the core of the critical mineral value chains. We are working with partners to deliver.</p><p>And we need finance -- real finance -- for developing countries to cut emissions, adapt to climate shocks, and recover from loss and damage. We must push governments to provide funds they have pledged. And explore new sources of finance -- including putting an effective price on carbon and establishing solidarity levies on polluting sectors and industries.</p><p>As a young man living under dictatorship in Portugal I learned -- as Amnesty's founders knew -- that standing up for freedom is standing on the right side of history.</p><p>And today, I am more certain than ever: When you stand for human rights, you stand with what is right. That is your history. When Amnesty was founded in the '60s the fight for a fairer world was raging: for civil rights; for women's rights; for liberation from colonial rule.</p><p>These causes once seemed a distant dream. So did Portuguese democracy. I can assure you that your courage continues to change lives. Your persistence is shifting the course of history. Let's keep going. Let's keep fighting. Let's meet this moment with the urgency it demands. And let's never, ever give up.</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention and your patience.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://press.un.org/en/2025/sgsm22740.doc.htm\">https://press.un.org/en/2025/sgsm22740.doc.htm</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9345725 MSTRUCK</p>", "publisher": "Targeted News Service", "instances": ["I see your invitation as a tribute to UN staff working around the world for human rights and for justice.

This includes regulating private companies, such as fossil fuel corporations, to drive their pollution levels down.</p><p>Human rights to life, health, food, water and a healthy environment are directly affected by climate change. Therefore, states must protect these rights.</p><p>Cumulative effects matter. One mining or drilling project may seem small but governments must consider its contribution to global emissions and climate harm.</p><p>Governments are also legally obliged to adapt towns, cities and rural areas so that they can withstand climate disasters, especially for those most at risk.</p><p>The advisory opinion is already being used in South Africa by a community and environmental law organisation, Natural Justice, and a sustainable development advocacy group, The Green Connection, in their appeal against a government decision to allow Shell to drill up to five exploration and appraisal wells off the coast of the Northern Cape province. Their appeal says the South African government has not considered how Shell\u2019s oil exploration will contribute to climate change.</p><p>I am an environmental law specialist who researches how international and domestic law can be used to advance climate justice in South Africa and across Africa. In my view, the advisory opinion could shift the balance in courtrooms across Africa in favour of environmental justice and human rights groups.</p><p>It confirms that governments must align fossil fuel decisions with their duty to prevent harm. This gives communities a stronger legal basis to argue that fossil fuel expansion undermines both their rights and their country\u2019s climate obligations.</p><p>South Africa is already experiencing worsening floods, droughts and storms. Every bit of warming increases these risks. The country\u2019s 2024 Climate Change Act sets out a pathway to cut emissions and build resilience. Yet fossil fuel projects are still being approved by the government. </p><p>In June 2025, South Africa\u2019s Department of Mineral Resources granted Shell an environmental authorisation to drill for oil and gas in the ocean on the country\u2019s West Coast. This area is ecologically sensitive, supporting whales, fish stocks and small-scale fishing communities.</p><p>Natural Justice and The Green Connection argue in their appeal that the authorisation is unlawful and defective. They give the following reasons.</p><p>The environmental impact assessment assumed an oil spill could be stopped far more quickly than is realistic, and downplayed the risks of ultra-deepwater drilling, where equipment failure or a blowout on the scale of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster is possible. These risks threaten marine ecosystems and small-scale fishers\u2019 livelihoods.</p><p>Some of Shell\u2019s safety and emergency response plans were not included in the assessment. This meant the public and decision-makers could not evaluate whether Shell is able to manage a major disaster. </p><p>Their absence doesn\u2019t mean Shell has no plans at all, but it does mean the decision was taken without a transparent review of those plans. No baseline studies were done before approval. Without this information, the risks from spills and pollution to whales, fish and corals were likely underestimated.</p><p>The appeal also says that there was no consideration about how future production might affect South Africa\u2019s ability to meet its Paris Agreement commitments, and that drilling for oil and gas is outdated as these are not renewable energies.</p><p>Any oil spills could pollute beyond South African borders, potentially reaching neighbouring Namibian waters. However, the environmental impact assessment ignored effects on Namibian fisheries, tourism and coastal communities.</p><p>Finally, the approval failed to comply with the Integrated Coastal Management Act, which says the South African government must protect sensitive ecosystems for the long-term benefit of communities and future generations.</p><p>The advisory opinion is not legally binding. However, the obligations it has confirmed, in international climate and customary law, are. It is the most authoritative interpretation yet of what governments must do to prevent further climate change.</p><p>Under South Africa\u2019s Constitution, courts must take international law into account when interpreting rights.</p><p>This gives organisations like Natural Justice and The Green Connection (and others across Africa) a powerful new tool. They can:</p><p>Challenge new fossil fuel projects in court by arguing they breach international obligations to prevent climate harm.</p><p>Hold governments accountable for weak climate policies or failure to meet Paris targets.</p><p>Strengthen community voices, showing that demands for clean energy and protection of livelihoods are backed by international law.</p><p>Build regional solidarity, with African groups drawing on the same opinion to resist fossil fuel expansion and demand climate justice.</p><p>Challenge new fossil fuel projects in court by arguing they breach international obligations to prevent climate harm.</p><p>Hold governments accountable for weak climate policies or failure to meet Paris targets strengthen community voices, showing that demands for clean energy and protection of livelihoods are backed by international law.</p><p>Build regional solidarity, with African groups drawing on the same opinion to resist fossil fuel expansion and demand climate justice.</p><p>Across Africa, where 45 countries are exploring for oil, gas or coal, the court\u2019s opinion raises the stakes by suggesting that continued fossil fuel expansion could breach international obligations. </p><p>The Shell appeal is a test for whether South African courts will accept that fossil fuel expansion in the era of the climate crisis is inconsistent with the Constitution and international law.</p><p>Van der Berg is an environmental law specialist who researches how international and domestic law can be used to advance climate justice in South Africa and across Africa.

This act mandates that disputes over federal contracts be adjudicated in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, not in federal district courts.</p><p>Building on this precedent, on August 29 Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the EPA in a case brought by the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Center, representing a coalition of nonprofits and local governments, had challenged the EPA\u2019s decision to terminate $2.8 billion in grants. Judge Leon, appointed by President George W. Bush, found that the EPA had acted within its legal authority.</p><p>Just days later, on September 2, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reached a similar conclusion.

The decision sets transnational standards that could shape legal jurisprudence in courts across the world. </p><p>Responding to the Advisory Opinion, Ana Piquer, Regional Director for the Americas at Amnesty International, stated: </p><p>'Each day of inaction means more suffering for the people and communities who have contributed the least to the climate crisis. Today, therefore, marks a moment of hope for millions of people in the Americas whose human rights are being devastated by this crisis. States now have clear guidance and can no longer claim ignorance of their human rights obligations. The roadmap is set - now is the time for immediate, concrete, and positive action to urgently tackle the climate crisis.' </p><p>The Court emphasized that the climate crisis does not affect all people equally. In the Americas and globally, Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendant communities, rural and fishing populations, women, children, older persons, and socioeconomically marginalized groups face disproportionate impacts. The Court ruled on the specific duties of states to prevent harm and ensure protection for these groups, affirming that climate action is a human rights obligation - not a political choice. </p><p>In this context, Mandi Mudarikwa, Head of Strategic Litigation at Amnesty International, emphasized: 'Today, the Inter-American Court affirmed and clarified the obligations of states to respect, ensure, prevent, and cooperate in order to realize human rights in the context of the climate crisis. Crucially, the Court recognized the autonomous right to a healthy climate for both individuals and communities, linked to the right to a healthy environment. The Court also underscored the obligation of states to protect cross-border climate-displaced persons, including through the issuance of humanitarian visas and protection from deportation.' </p><p>This Advisory Opinion is a significant contribution to the ongoing development and clarification of states' human rights obligations in the face of climate change. Amnesty International looks forward with great interest to future decisions resulting from advisory opinions to be issued by the International Court of Justice later this year, as well as from other regional courts, domestic courts, and quasi-judicial bodies. </p><p>BACKGROUND </p><p>The request for this advisory opinion was submitted by the governments of Chile and Colombia in January 2023, seeking clarification on states' obligations in the face of the climate emergency under international human rights law. Public hearings were held in Barbados (April 2024) and Brazil (May 2024), with unprecedented civil society participation. Amnesty International submitted a legal brief to the Court as amicus curiae, providing legal analysis on human rights and climate change. </p><p>This is the second authoritative advisory opinion on climate change. One year ago, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) issued a landmark advisory opinion on states' obligations to mitigate climate change, particularly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). </p>", "publisher": "ASEAN Tribune", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 16, "title": "Updated: August 29, 2025: Sussex named happiest university in the UK and other recent news", "published": "2025-09-02", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The University of Sussex has been ranked the happiest university in the UK in the Unifresher Happiest Universities 2026 Guide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 1 UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX PATENTS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 1 UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX PATENTS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1.1 Previous UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX Patent title:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Issue Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Issuing Office</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Patent Title</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Patent Number</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Nov 6, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EPO</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Pickering Emulsions</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">12122922</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>1.2 Previous UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX Patent abstract:</p><p>November 6, 2024 University of Sussex issued patent titled \"Pickering Emulsions\"</p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>The present invention relates to a method for making a Pickering emulsion, the method comprising: exfoliating a non-silicate layered 3D material in a solvent to produce particles of a non-silicate unfunctionalised 2D material; forming a dispersion of the particles of the 2D material in a first liquid phase; adding a second liquid phase; and homogenising the dispersion of the 2D material in the first liquid phase with the second liquid phase to form a Pickering emulsion comprising the first liquid phase, the second liquid phase, and the particles of the 2D materia</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>May 13: Celebrating the winners of this year's Sussex Awards</p><p>On Tuesday 6 May we held the first-ever Sussex Awards ceremony on campus at the Attenborough Centre.

This is the attitude that is required of the government, especially as the effects of climate change include a worsening of weather conditions, which means, among other things, that monsoonal floods will be worse, and as bad as this year's floods have been, coming years will see a repetition. This is likely to be the new normal with which the government will have to contend. Speaking very roughly, with a monsoon extending roughly from mid-July to the end of October, The time for preparation is thus about eight months, with about four months of execution. Of course, some preparations are only possible in the light of weather forecasts, and while it is now possible to give broad brushstrokes, the kind of forecasts needed for proper planning cannot be achieved without forecasts which will only be available much later in the year.</p><p>While talking about this year's floods, which are not yet over, Mr Sharif was emphatic that those affected be given relief and rehabilitation, and also issued special directions that the federal government should support the provincial governments in their relief and rehabilitation efforts. Indeed, as the governments cannot very well be expected to stop the floods, the relief and rehabilitation efforts are where the government is best able to intervene. Mr Sharif's direction that preparations for next year's monsoon start is a clear indication that he thought this year's effort has fallen short. That has been a constant complaint the whole season of citizens, and a couple of dramatic incidents, where there was not enough warning given, has merely made matters worse.</p><p>One of the most regrettable aspects to emerge is that the rehabilitation of the victims of the 2023 floods has not been completed.

With the passage of the Community Benefit Fund (Senate Bill 48) and the Innovation in State Government Fund (Senate Bill 83), the state is proving that smart, community-driven climate action isn't just possible - it's already happening.</p><p>These wins are the result of years of hard work by advocates, lawmakers and New Mexicans from across the state who believe in a future where clean energy, good jobs and resilient communities go hand in hand. The Community Benefit Fund is a groundbreaking initiative that puts real money into local projects that create jobs, expand clean energy and equip communities to build resilience in the face of climate challenges and adapt to climate changes. Whether it's building energy-efficient homes, strengthening disaster response centers or bringing reliable solar and wind power to rural areas, this fund will make a tangible difference in people's lives.</p><p>The Innovation in Government Act will help state agencies tackle climate change head-on by giving them the tools and resources they need to plan for the future. Having strong policies is one thing - but making sure agencies have the funding and capacity to enforce them is just as important. Together, these two bills move New Mexico closer to a future where climate action is proactive rather than reactive.</p><p>As exciting as these wins are, New Mexicans know the fight isn't over. The next big challenge is getting enforceable, comprehensive climate pollution reduction targets ready to pass next session - and that work is underway. Recent polling shows that 77% of New Mexicans support the government taking action to reduce carbon and methane pollution that contribute to climate change. The need for action is increasingly urgent as the second Trump administration continues to prioritize corporate profits over the health and well-being of us all.</p><p>The Clear Horizons Act is the next major step. This bill establishes statewide limits on greenhouse gas emissions, holding polluters accountable and pushing New Mexico toward a carbon-free future.</p><p>While the Clear Horizons Act didn't make it through the Legislature this time, momentum is growing. Alongside the Clear Horizons Coalition, we will roll up our sleeves over the next year to make sure comprehensive climate pollution reduction targets cross the finish line next session.</p><p>Over the coming months, we'll bring together businesses, labor groups, tribal and Navajo leaders, and local communities to make the case that clean energy means good jobs, long-term savings and a safer future. We're committed to working together to refine the Clear Horizons Act to make sure it's ambitious, effective, achievable and focused on large source emitters - not everyday New Mexicans who rely on propane, wood burning stoves or make their living by ranching.</p><p>New Mexico has already shown what's possible with bold climate action - from the Energy Transition Act to the Community Benefit Fund.

This is a key moment: the climate emergency has already been recognized as such by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) in Advisory Opinion 32/2025 and, at the same time, national and international pressure to translate commitments into concrete actions is growing and will continue to grow.</p><p><br/>The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) has launched a participatory process to enrich the new NDC. Civil society organizations, specialists and citizens have put forward specific proposals: from the reduction of methane emissions to the construction of a just energy transition, including cross-cutting approaches such as human rights and gender. However, it must be clearly stated: Semarnat cannot and should not do it alone.<br/>For the first time, the presentation of the NDC coincides with the beginning of a new federal administration. This is a unique opportunity to align this international commitment with the national programs that will define public climate policy in the coming years. Not taking advantage of it would be wasting valuable time in the face of the environmental and climate crisis. In addition, climate justice must be the guiding principle of the new NDC. This means recognizing that the impacts of the crisis are not evenly distributed: indigenous, rural and marginalized urban communities face the greatest risks, even though they contribute the least to the generation of greenhouse gas emissions.<br/>Incorporating their voices in policy design and ensuring that the energy and production transition does not deepen inequalities is an indispensable condition for climate action to be fair and effective. At the same time, climate justice implies common but at the same time differentiated responsibilities. Sectors with greater economic and technological capacity must assume a proportionally higher burden in reducing emissions and financing adaptation measures and loss and damage. Otherwise, the transition risks reproducing the same patterns of exclusion and concentration of benefits that fueled the crisis. A justice-focused NDC can be the bridge between international commitments and building a more equitable and resilient country.<br/>The challenge is not only for the NDC to be realistic, but also for it not to remain on paper. In practice, it must be implemented properly and on time. It is of little use for Mexico to sign up to ambitious commitments to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions if the sectors that weigh most heavily in the country's emissions - energy, agriculture, industry, transportation - do not adjust their policies, budgets and decisions to both national and international climate commitments.<br/>Without such coherence, the NDC runs the risk of becoming an unfulfilled promise, something that has already happened in the past and that we cannot afford to repeat, as it implies negative consequences on the environment, natural resources, as well as people's health and quality of life. The real test will be in mainstreaming. Integrating the climate perspective into energy planning, agricultural policy, industrial incentives and even tourism strategy is the only way to move from intention to action. Assuming the NDC as a State commitment and not as an environmental formality is the only way to confront a crisis that is no longer just a climate crisis: it is a human rights crisis.<br/>* Founder and Executive Director of the Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA).<br/>** Research and Public Policy Manager of CEMDA.<br/></p>", "publisher": "CE Noticias Financieras English", "instances": ["This is a unique opportunity to align this international commitment with the national programs that will define public climate policy in the coming years.

Otherwise, the transition risks reproducing the same patterns of exclusion and concentration of benefits that fueled the crisis."]}, {"relevance_score": 49, "title": "This Is Our Home: Pacific Musicians Giving Climate Action a Soundtrack", "published": "2025-09-13", "bodyText": "<p>Apia, Samoa: Pacific Regional Environment Programme has issued the following press release:</p><p>When a group of friends from across the Pacific gathered in Nadi, Fiji for what was meant to be a small reception music gig, they didn \u2019 t know they were about to spark something much bigger than themselves. During the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty \u2019 s Pacific Strategy meeting, they were invited to join in on the sessions, to listen to the stories from frontline advocates from across the region and to express how they felt about these stories through the medium they knew best - music. By the end of the event, they weren \u2019 t just a band, they were a movement.\u201cBy the time I returned home, the team was already sending me original music they had written and composed at the retreat, inspired by the stories they had heard and what they had seen\u201d, recalls Joe Moeono-Kolio, the project \u2019 s founder. The group became, \u2018This Is Our Home \u2019 - a nod to the title of its first original song written by Mr Junior Soqeta from Fiji and its main message.</p><p>That movement landed them in Samoa last week, where they were part of the Thirty second SPREP Meeting of Officials (SM32) and associated meetings from 1-5 September. The group performed during the opening of Emma Luke Earth Observation Centre, and then on the last day of the SPREP Meeting, featured in the Amplifying our Pacific Voices side event hosted by SPREP \u2019 s Climate Change Resilience programme and the Communications and Outreach Unit.\u201cWe thought this would be an opportunity to weave artistry, like music, into the climate action space,\u201d recalls Mr Sione Pole from Tonga. \u201cPoetry and dance already existed there, but not much music. We wanted to give the Pacific climate movement its own soundtrack. \u201d\u201cEven though most of us are part of the diaspora, the islands are our homes. That \u2019 s where our parents and ancestors come from,\u201d explains the group \u2019 s guitarist Mr Vailahi Vaoese from Tuvalu. \u201cWe just want to carry the torch forward in the way we know best, through music and storytelling. \u201dIn the early days, their rehearsals were chilled and laid back, often thrown together days or hours before performances. But the chemistry was undeniable, these weren \u2019 t strangers, they were already friends who had grown up singing together. The challenge wasn \u2019 t learning how to play but learning how to infuse every lyric and harmony with a sense of urgency about climate justice.\u201cIt \u2019 s no longer just an ordinary gig,\u201d says Sione. \u201cEvery song has to carry a story that connects to the movement. \u201dThat clarity of purpose carried them onto one of the biggest stages in the world. A chance meeting with the multi-award-winning producer, Brian Eno led to an invitation that most artists only dream of: performing with Coldplay in Lyon, France in 2024 before a crowd of over 50,000.Wearing their traditional attire, they sang indigenous songs on the global stage and used the mega-platform to speak to the issues facing our islands and oceans to their target audience - the masses outside of the Pacific who do not think about climate change.\u201cIt was the opportunity of a lifetime and a blessing,\u201d says Sione.When Coldplay brought their world tour to New Zealand, the partnership deepened. The Pacific group shared the stage on all three shows in Auckland, weaving their own music into Coldplay \u2019 s iconic \u201cFix You\u201d and \u201cWe Pray. \u201dFor Nate Lopa, Samoan-Tokelaun, it wasn \u2019 t just about music, it was about solidarity.\u201cThey didn \u2019 t owe us anything, but they gave us their platform to talk about climate justice. It showed the kind of legacy they want to leave. \u201dThat exposure elevated their journey to a new level. Suddenly, the world wanted to know who these Pacific voices were. \u201cColdplay gave no one a choice,\u201d laughs Nate. \u201cIf you came to see them, you also saw us. It was history in the making. \u201dColdplay \u2019 s global spotlight brought new attention to This Is Our Home, but the band insists their mission remains unchanged. They aren \u2019 t chasing fame; they \u2019 re chasing impact. The platform is but a gateway to the unreached, those who could never understand what it is like on the front lines of climate change, those who could be inspired to act locally through the power of music.\u201cWhat that opportunity did,\u201d Nate explains, \u201cis show young people who look like us that it \u2019 s possible to stand on stages that weren \u2019 t created for us. We were there for climate justice, but we were also showing that Pacific voices belong on the world stage. \u201dAnd while their dream collaborators range from Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder to the late George Fiji Veikoso, the band keeps returning home to the Pacific to ground themselves.Recently performing at a side event at the margins of the 32nd SPREP Meeting of Officials, reminded them why they began in the first place. \u201cWe \u2019 re not here to educate our people,\u201d Nate reflects. \u201cWe \u2019 re here to acknowledge their work, to stand alongside them, and to make sure they know they \u2019 re not fighting alone. \u201dFor the members of This Is Our Home, every performance is both protest and prayer, a way to honour their ancestors, inspire their peers, and remind the world that the Pacific is not just a dot on the map. It is home. And it is worth fighting for. As Sione puts it, \u201cwe are the messengers of our reality. \u201dNow, as they prepare to release their debut album during COP30, the team prepares once again to take that message out into the mission field and in the farthest corners of the world, shining a light on what \u2019 s happening here in the Pacific.As Nate sums it up: \u201cTomorrow isn \u2019 t promised. But today, we \u2019 re blessed with the chance to use the talents God gave us to sing, dance, and tell the stories of our people.

One of the key points will be a policy debate on a proposal to amend the European Climate Legislation to establish a binding intermediate climate target for 2040.

The director of Ecology and Global Change at the National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN-CSIC), Fernando Valladares, differentiates between two types of measures that can be carried out from Brussels to address the Spanish environmental reality. On the one hand, there are \"short-term measures, which are normally posturing and small band-aids for big problems, but which have the great advantage that they can be applied tomorrow\", he describes to this newspaper. These strategies can be \"aid or economic grants that help to alleviate the disaster\", although they are \"cosmetic, diplomatic, aesthetic ways of showing concern for Spain\", criticizes the scientist.<br/>The second type of measures has to do with \"a profound change in the new direction that Europe is taking, an unrecognizable direction in environmental matters\". Valladares observes with concern a shift towards \"developmentalism and investment in highly polluting industries, both in terms of GHG emissions and overexploitation of key resources such as water\". The scientist stresses that \"what would really help Spain\" would be for Europe to recover \"the philosophy of the Green Pact\", a vision, according to which \"without a balance with the climate and the environment, there is no margin for the economy, human rights, stability or security\". Delage expresses himself in a similar vein, defending that the European climate policy \"must shield and include solidarity, financial support and criteria of climate justice, as well as a profound change of paradigm at the level of governance to keep up with the profound transformation of the productive system demanded by science\".<br/>Sehrish Usman believes that \"having timely impact estimates helps policy makers to target support and adapt strategies while the effects of extreme events are still unfolding\". However, Fernando Prieto regrets that Europe does not recognize \"at all\" the particular vulnerability of Spain to the ecological emergency. The director of the Sustainability Observatory calls for \"much more serious resources from the north to the south\" to carry out measures to adapt to climate change, which have historically been \"the poor sister of environmental policy\".
