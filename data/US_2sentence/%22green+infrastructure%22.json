According to news reporting originating from Jinan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Amidst the intensifying impacts of global economic turbulence and external instabilities, the urgency to enhance urban sustainable development capabilities has become increasingly pronounced. Urban green-infrastructure investment, as a pivotal investment direction, plays a significant role in strengthening urban sustainable development capabilities.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include China College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, Undergraduate Research Fund of Shandong Normal University. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Shandong Normal University, \"Based on panel data from 281 prefecture-level cities in China from 2010 to 2022, this study employs an empirical model to thoroughly investigate the impact of urban green-infrastructure investment on urban sustainable development and its underlying mechanisms. The research findings indicate the following: (1) Urban green-infrastructure investment significantly promotes the enhancement of urban sustainable development levels, a conclusion that remains robust after undergoing robustness tests. (2) The mechanism tests reveal that the enhancement of industrial chain resilience, ecological environment resilience, and talent agglomeration are crucial pathways through which urban green-infrastructure investment drives sustainable urban economic development. (3) Heterogeneity analysis finds that cities in the central and western regions, resource-based cities, cities with lower levels of urbanization, and cities with higher degrees of openness are more sensitive to the sustainable development-enhancing effects of green-infrastructure investment. (4) Spatial effect tests show that urban green-infrastructure investment has a positive spatial spillover effect on enhancing urban sustainable development levels. Based on these findings, it is recommended that cities increase investment in green infrastructure, optimize investment structures, promote the enhancement of industrial chain and ecological environment resilience, strengthen talent agglomeration effects, and leverage regional comparative advantages to invest in green infrastructure in a location-specific manner.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study not only validates the positive impact of urban green-infrastructure investment on urban sustainable development but also provides multi-perspective insights and references for analyzing the effects of urban green-infrastructure investment, offering policy support for achieving urban sustainable development.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: How Does Green-infrastructure Investment Empower Urban Sustainable Development?-mechanisms and Empirical Tests.

According to news reporting originating from Turin, Italy, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Nature-based Solutions (NbS) offer a promising, sustainable framework for addressing urban environmental challenges by harnessing the intrinsic functions of natural ecosystems.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Horizon Europe Framework Programme. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Turin: \"Defined as economically viable strategies inspired by nature, NbS aim to protect, manage, and restore ecosystems for mutual benefits to both people and nature. In urban and peri-urban contexts, NbS, such as green infrastructure and bioremediation, provide effective approaches to mitigating climate change, enhancing soil, air and water quality, reducing urban heat, and restoring ecological balance. Green infrastructure, comprising parks, urban forests, green roofs, and wetlands, has been shown to improve soil quality by enhancing organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus accumulation, as well as fostering biodiversity. Complementarily, bioremediation strategies, including microbial remediation and phytoremediation, have proven effective in decontaminating soils laden with heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, microplastics, and other pollutants, while promoting soil fertility and ecosystem services. Despite their demonstrated benefits, the efficacy of NbS is influenced by environmental factors such as soil pH, temperature, oxygen availability, and pollutant diversity. In addition, while NbS continue to evolve and their integration into urban planning represents a vital step toward creating resilient, healthy, and sustainable cities, their application in urban environments remains fragmented.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Therefore, further research is required to optimize NbS interventions, scale up their implementation, and evaluate long-term impacts under urban conditions characterized by anthropogenic stressors. This review examines green infrastructure and bioremediation strategies, highlighting key case studies and evaluating their effects on soil quality and overall remediation outcomes.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: The potential of nature-based solutions for urban soils: focus on green infrastructure and bioremediation.

In this study, a multi-objective optimization framework was developed to address these challenges by integrating a Cellular Automata (CA)-based hydrological model with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The CA-based model enables grid-resolution simulation of surface runoff processes, and the optimization algorithm identifies spatial configurations of BGI to address landscape-hydrology-cost effectiveness trade-offs. The framework was applied to the Heping River catchment in Nanjing, China, under a 20-year return period storm scenario. The optimized BGI allocation solutions achieved an average increase of 7.45 % in water bodies and 19.92 % in green stormwater infrastructures, alongside a 20.15 % reduction in impervious surfaces. These improvements corresponded to a 19.73 % increase in landscape objective, a 27.55 % improvement in hydrology performance, and a 26.59 % reduction in life-cycle cost (LCC).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In contrast to existing methods that primarily rely on semi-distributed models such as SWMM, the proposed framework advances spatial precision by explicitly modelling hydrological processes at the grid level and allowing for fine-grained spatial allocation of BGI elements.

The core challenge is discerned as the inability of quantification to accurately identify, characterize, and simulate biophysical structures, processes, and their interaction mechanisms, which constitutes the foundation of inconsistency in GIP workflows and methodologies. Addressing this gap while considering GI's inherent social attributes and ES's essential role in human well-being, we conduct supplementary reviews of the full ES continuum (supplyflow-demand) to develop a standardized GIP decision-making framework. Within this framework, we propose resolving the core challenge through integrated methods that compensate for individual method's limitations, and a standardized system dominated by ecosystem indicators to eliminate mechanistic oversights and subjective biases.

Under the climate change scenarios, FRS supply showed a declining trend from 10year to 100-year storm events (0.28-0.21, 0.26-0.22 for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively); while the changes in the averaged FRS supply-demand ratio values caused by climate change increased as the return period increased (from -0.69 % to -4.36 % and from -1.48 % to 2.55 % under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The area proportion of residential zone units located in the high priority level for green infrastructure implementation was 51.8 %, and the area of commercial zone units located in the high priority areas accounts for 38.4 %.

While absorption of Hg is primarily related to its environmental level, it could be theoretically mitigated by near-natural habitats that have persisted within the urban landscape. Here, we investigated this hypothesis using three sympatric corvids as a model - Magpie Pica pica, Jackdaw Corvus monedula and Rook Corvus frugilegus. Total Hg concentrations were identified in the feathers (in the shafts and barbs separately) of each species collected in their breeding territories located along the urbanization gradient of Krakow (Poland). These concentrations were then correlated with particulate matter emissions (PM10) and habitat features (green and grey infrastructure) measured in the territories where the feathers had been collected. We expected that Hg concentrations in feathers would increase with increasing local pollutant emissions but decrease with increasing areas of green infrastructure, i.e. natural or semi-natural vegetation. Mean Hg concentrations in both feather shafts and barbs differed between the species. Magpie showed the highest concentrations (0.621 +-0.442 SD mcg/g in barbs), followed by Jackdaw (0.441 +-0.272 mcg/g) and Rook (0.296 +-0.134 mcg/g).<br/> \u201cA generalized linear model yielded a correlation between habitat composition and Hg concentration only for Jackdaw feather shafts.<br/> \u201cA generalized additive model, however, revealed a non-linear relationship between PM10 emissions and Hg concentrations in feather barbs and/or shafts of Jackdaw and Magpie (but not Rook).

For example, in the north it is important to protect wetlands, oases and streams, while in Valdivia, a wetland city, the focus is on protecting local wetlands. Each region protects its specific ecosystems and generates green infrastructure networks with nature-based solutions.<br/>What were the main results of the public consultation?<br/>The formal public consultation ended on August 8 and lasted a month, but the drafting process had been going on for more than a year. It was very participatory, starting with regional diagnostics open to the public to identify problems and opportunities. Then, a national advisory committee, with representatives from the public and private sectors, academia and civil society, drew up the preliminary draft with objectives, goals and roadmap to 2050. The public consultation made it possible to ratify and strengthen the actions previously designed.<br/>What aspects were most valued?<br/>People ratified the importance of the strategy, including regulations that encourage the private sector, the participation of communities in the design, management and maintenance of spaces, and the sustainability of projects over time. The consultation showed that the actions proposed in the strategy were valued by citizens and relevant to maintain and generate green infrastructure.<br/>Are there short- or medium-term actions or is everything only for 2050?<br/>The strategy has a roadmap with short (until 2030), medium (2030-2040) and long term (2040-2050) horizons. In the short term, enabling actions are implemented, such as training municipal and regional officials, generating a culture of the importance of the initiative, designing project portfolios, involving the private sector, and defining areas of natural value and areas where green infrastructure can be created. Priorities are also identified to address climate change impacts in different areas of the city.<br/>Does this strategy still require approval?<br/>The strategy has already gone out for public consultation and is expected to be approved in November of this year, to begin implementation in 2026. Although it has not yet been published or promulgated, the last few months are being dedicated to consolidating the final draft. The strategy will operate until 2050, following short, medium and long term stages, and will be the roadmap for other plans and public policies on climate action, territorial planning and biodiversity.<br/>How will this initiative be financed?<br/>The financing is multi-sectoral: it comes from the public sector, international funds such as the Green Climate Fund, and the private sector. In addition, we seek to involve civil society and foundations, generating innovative and sustainable financing mechanisms over time. We also seek to update regulations to encourage the private sector and establish permanent funds to ensure long-term planning.<br/>What international experiences inspired you?<br/>Experiences from cities such as Medellin, Barcelona and Rosario. Medellin has a renaturation plan with green corridors, green walls and green roofs. Barcelona has a national green infrastructure strategy. Rosario is developing urban garden networks.

This change maintains the accuracy of water balance simulations by ensuring that total evaporation, infiltration, and runoff are correctly represented, regardless of the reporting time step. Our results indicate that while small reporting time steps are preferred for detailed peak analysis, the averaged results provide a reliable alternative for comprehensive, long-term planning and climate adaptation studies.

At the local scale, a 214-hectare area is analyzed using fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) to select the optimal locations for different nature-based solutions. At the microscale, spatiotemporal hydrological simulations of a 25-year return period rainfall event quantify the runoff and infiltration dynamics under different GI configurations, achieving infrastructure layouts that infiltrated over 1000 m<sup>3</sup> of stormwater.

Here a new methodology is presented for designing synthetic 3D drainage channels as blue-green infrastructure to enhance multidisciplinary decision-making for sustainable urban drainage systems planning and elements of nature-based stormwater management. LiDAR derived digital elevation models and River Builder software were used to generate four unique drainage channel scenarios with different surface geometries and vegetative cover types for flood modelling. Flood risks were assessed by fluvial simulation responses to specific channel elements and the design process may translate to real-world applications. Fluvial simulations were compared to evaluate how flood inundation patterns and flow velocities responded to morphology changes and roughness coefficients.

This study assesses the carbon sequestration potential of urban forests in Budapest, the capital city of Hungary, which lies at the intersection of the Great Hungarian Plain and the Buda Hills, and is traversed by the Danube River.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Hungarian Ministry of Energy. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Forest Research Institute: \"The city is characterized by a temperate climate with hot summers and cold winters, and a diverse range of soil types, including shallow Leptosols and Cambisols in the limestone and dolomite hills of Buda, well-developed Luvisols and Regosols in the valleys, Fluvisols and Arenosols in the flood-affected areas of Pest, and Technosols found on both sides of the city. The assessment utilizes data from the National Forestry Database and the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service High Resolution Layer Tree Cover Density. The results show that Budapest's urban forests and trees contribute an estimated annual carbon offset of -41,338 tCO [ [2] ] , approximately 1% of the city's total emissions. The urban forests on the Buda and Pest sides of the city exhibit notable differences in carbon sequestration and storage, age class structure, tree species composition, and naturalness. On the Buda side, older semi-natural forests dominated by native species primarily act as in situ carbon reservoirs, with limited additional sequestration capacity due to their older age, slower growth, and longer rotation periods. In contrast, the Pest-side forests, which are primarily extensively managed introduced forests and tree plantations, contain a higher proportion of non-native species such as black locust ( Robinia pseudoacacia ) and hybrid poplars ( Populus x euramericana ).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Despite harsher climatic conditions, Pest-side forests perform better in carbon sink capacity compared to those on the Buda side, as they are younger, with lower carbon stocks but higher sequestration rates.

(NYSE: GFL) (TSX: GFL) (\"GFL\" or the \"Company\") today announced that Green Infrastructure Partners (\"GIP\") has entered into a definitive agreement with funds managed by Energy Capital Partners, LLC (\"ECP\") to recapitalize its business at an enterprise value of $4.25 billion. GIP is a leading vertically integrated infrastructure company established in 2022 by GFL, funds managed by HPS Investment Partners Inc.

GFL will receive approximately $200.0 million of the $585.0 million shareholder distribution. Pro forma for the transaction, GIP's total equity value will be approximately $3.0 billion. After the distribution to GFL of approximately $200.0 million, GFL will own an approximate 30.1% interest in GIP valued at approximately $895.0 million. HPS and Mr. Dovigi will each also continue to hold a minority stake in GIP and support the company's future growth. The transaction is expected to close on or about September 2, 2025.\"The recapitalization of GIP at an enterprise value of $4.25 billion is a testament to the quality of the business its management team has built since we started GIP in April 2022,\" said Patrick Dovigi, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of GFL. \"The approximately $200.0 million in proceeds that GFL will receive from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including de-levering our balance sheet, executing on our organic and inorganic growth strategies, including our robust M&amp;A pipeline, and pursuing opportunistic share buybacks, subject to market conditions. This transaction allows GFL to monetize part of our position in GIP in a tax efficient manner, while still retaining a meaningful equity interest that will allow us to participate in what we expect to be continued value creation from the GIP business.\"Mr. Dovigi continued, \"After a robust evaluation showing significant interest in GIP, the board of GIP selected ECP to partner with on this transaction. ECP is a leading investor in critical infrastructure, with deep expertise and a demonstrated track record of value creation for its stakeholders. We look forward to working with ECP on executing GIP's growth strategy.\"Mr. Dovigi concluded, \"Over the years, I have re-iterated my belief that we could create $1.0 billion of value for GFL shareholders through our investment in GIP. Our original investment of approximately $250.0 million in 2022 has grown to approximately $1.1 billion in just over three years. That is a direct reflection of the strength of GFL's management team and the execution of our strategies to create long term shareholder value. We believe that this recapitalization positions GIP to significantly exceed our original value expectations in the near term and sets the company up for an exciting period of growth.\"Scot French, Founding Partner and Co-President of HPS, said, \"We congratulate management on this significant milestone and thank our longstanding partners at GFL for their vision and steadfast execution in building Canada's premier infrastructure service provider. We are proud to invest in companies like GIP and GFL that play an important role in maintaining and improving the critical infrastructure and essential services that people rely on every day. We look forward to continuing to partner with GFL in unlocking additional shareholder value together with GIP in its next chapter of growth.\"\"We see significant tailwinds for GIP's essential, vertically-integrated infrastructure offerings,\" said Drew Brown, Partner at ECP. \"This transaction will provide GIP with access to significant capital to execute on a compelling M&amp;A pipeline that we believe is particularly actionable in the near-term. With two decades of investing in North American infrastructure, ECP is well-equipped to act as a value-add partner with GIP, and we look forward to working with the talented GIP and GFL leadership teams to execute on a shared vision for growth and margin enhancement.\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About GFL</emphasis>GFL, headquartered in Vaughan, Ontario, is the fourth largest diversified environmental services company in North America, providing a comprehensive line of solid waste management services through its platform of facilities throughout Canada and 18 U.S. states.

Yet, paradoxically, the continent faces a massive infrastructure gap estimated at over $100 billion annually. This gap stifles economic growth, limits regional integration, and frustrates industrial development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But this paradox can be turned into a possibility. In today's era of global climate urgency, Africa's natural wealth positions it as a strategic destination for green investment. By smartly leveraging our abundant resources, especially those critical for the global clean energy transition, Africa can attract sustainable capital to build roads, power plants, rail systems, water systems, and digital infrastructure.</p><p>This is more than a development agenda; it is an opportunity for Africa to shape a green, inclusive, and resilient future.</p><p>The rise of green investment: A global trend Africa must seize</p><p>Green investment, capital deployed in environmentally responsible and climate-smart projects, has grown exponentially over the last decade. Global ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) assets are projected to surpass $50 trillion by 2025, representing a third of all managed assets worldwide.</p><p>Africa must position itself not as a passive recipient of aid, but as an active destination for climate-smart capital. The global green transition cannot succeed without Africa. The world's largest reserves of cobalt, manganese, platinum, and lithium, critical for electric vehicles and batteries, are in African soil. Africa also has immense solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy potential.</p><p>If strategically leveraged, these resources can attract green investment at scale, not just for extraction but also for infrastructure development that powers inclusive growth.</p><p>Turning resources into green infrastructure: A strategic framework</p><p>1. Resource-backed infrastructure financing</p><p>African countries can negotiate green infrastructure financing using their resource wealth, such as rare earth metals, renewable energy capacity, or carbon credits, as collateral or shared equity. Strategic resource-backed partnerships must ensure long-term benefits for local economies, including processing and value addition.</p><p>'If strategically leveraged, these resources can attract green investment at scale, not just for extraction but also for infrastructure development that powers inclusive growth.'</p><p>2. Renewable energy as an anchor</p><p>Africa receives more sunlight than any other continent, yet it accounts for just 1 percent of global solar generation capacity. Massive investments in utility-scale solar farms, mini-grids, and off-grid solar solutions can power homes, industries, and agriculture.</p><p>Public-private partnerships with green energy investors can also create jobs and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Egypt's Benban Solar Park and Morocco's Noor Solar Complex are leading examples.</p><p>3. Mineral-driven green supply chains</p><p>Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt), Zimbabwe (lithium), and South Africa (platinum) can create green industrial corridors, linking mining with refining, manufacturing, and logistics infrastructure. Instead of exporting raw minerals, African nations must champion global value chains supporting green technologies.</p><p>4. Carbon credits and climate finance</p><p>Africa's forests, wetlands, and savannahs act as global carbon sinks. Through verified carbon offset projects, countries can generate revenue by preserving ecosystems and selling credits to companies in Europe, Asia, and North America. These proceeds can be reinvested into green transport, water systems, and resilient urban planning. Kenya, Gabon, and Rwanda are already exploring these innovative pathways. 5. Green bonds and ESG-linked sovereign funds</p><p>African governments and financial institutions should issue green bonds to finance climate-aligned infrastructure such as resilient roads, electric buses, and water treatment facilities. Nigeria pioneered this with its sovereign green bond in 2017-others must follow with stronger frameworks, accountability, and private sector participation.</p><p>Overcoming the challenges</p><p>While the opportunities are immense, Africa must address critical barriers to attracting green investment:</p><p> Policy uncertainty: Investors need clear, consistent, transparent regulatory environments. Governments must build trust through predictable frameworks and strong governance.</p><p> Weak institutional capacity: Countries must strengthen institutions that manage public-private partnerships, oversee ESG compliance, and enforce environmental safeguards.</p><p> Limited local financing: Domestic resource mobilisation through pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and diaspora bonds must be prioritised to complement external capital.</p><p> Lack of bankable projects: Technical support is needed to structure and de-risk infrastructure projects so they meet international green investment criteria.</p><p>What governments and business leaders must do</p><p>1. Develop national green infrastructure plans: Align resource utilisation with net-zero goals, local industrialisation, and inclusive development.</p><p>2. Establish resource governance policies: Ensure transparency in resource contracts and revenue use. The Africa Mining Vision is a good benchmark.</p><p>3. Create investment-ready pipelines: Package viable infrastructure projects with clear ROI, strong ESG performance, and local community impact.</p><p>4. Foster regional integration: Build transnational infrastructure projects, rail lines, power pools, and data corridors, that multiply investor value and deepen intra-African trade.</p><p>5 Engage the private sector and diaspora: Africa's transformation will be investor-led, not donor-led. Incentivise domestic and diaspora investors to co-finance infrastructure through blended models.</p><p>Conclusion: A green future built on African soil</p><p>Africa must move from being a passive exporter of raw materials to becoming an active architect of green prosperity. By leveraging its natural endowments to attract sustainable capital, Africa can close its infrastructure gap while contributing meaningfully to global climate goals.</p><p>This is not just about building roads or solar parks but about creating a self-reliant, resilient, and respected continent. With wise leadership, strong institutions, and strategic partnerships, Africa can transform its resource wealth into world-class infrastructure and, in doing so, light the path for generations to come.</p><p>Let us not wait for permission.

A total of 153 children aged 8-12 and 109 parents participated in this study in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Children explored a UGI route using either a GPS-based application, or a guide and a map. Children identified playing with peers and families as a facilitator of their interaction with nature and the use of digital tools as a barrier. The results show that children's perception of connection to nature is higher among girls, and positively correlates with their parents' perception of connection to nature and attitudes towards its benefits. Children's perception of connection to nature increases after a nature-related activity across all groups, with boys and older children showing greater improvement.

Maura Healey, D-Massachusetts, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Healey-Driscoll Administration Awards Nearly $30 Million to Help Communities Prepare for Flooding, Heat Waves and Wildfires</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">*</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Boston -- The Healey-Driscoll Administration today announced $28.7 million in grants to help 54 Massachusetts communities prepare for increasingly extreme weather - including heat waves, flooding, wildfires and storms. This year, the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) made a targeted effort to recruit rural and small towns into the Massachusetts Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Action Grant program, with $11.1 million going specifically to those areas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The funding supports real, on-the-ground improvements - such as rebuilding parks with shaded spaces where residents can cool off during heat waves, protecting wetlands that reduce flooding in neighborhoods, and designing safer, more affordable housing on higher ground. Other projects include new wildfire evacuation routes, culvert upgrades to stop roads from washing out, and emergency plans to protect people most at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Communities across Massachusetts are already feeling the impacts of rising heat, flooding and other extreme weather. These grants give them the ability to prepare before disaster strikes - protecting homes, public spaces and essential services,\" said Governor Maura Healey. \"Preparation is the most affordable, effective way to protect people and avoid much higher costs down the road.\"</p><p>\"As a former mayor, I know how hard it can be for local governments to take on complex challenges while still keeping up with day-to-day services,\" said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. \"MVP gives communities the resources to tackle problems like upgrading Gallow Hills Park and Bertram Field in Salem with green infrastructure solutions to mitigate flooding without having to choose between urgent needs and long-term safety.</p><p>The MVP Program is a statewide initiative that helps cities and towns plan and implement locally-driven strategies to deal with the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. The program goes beyond funding plans - it helps communities turn those plans into action. Since its inception in 2017, MVP has funded over 500 projects ranging from stormwater system upgrades and cooling shelters to updated zoning and emergency response planning.</p><p>This year's initiative also emphasizes equity and inclusion. A new effort launched this year as part of MVP 2.0 pairs communities with equity partners - local organizations and individuals that specialize in community engagement. These partners help towns ensure that planning reflects the needs of all residents, especially those most at risk.</p><p>The MVP program is also a core piece of Governor Healey's recently proposed Mass Ready Act, which includes $315 million to further invest in local economies.</p><p>\"We're seeing more communities step up to address the real impacts they're facing - hotter summers, stronger storms and more frequent flooding,\" said EEA Secretary Rebecca Tepper. \"These grants support that work by funding practical, local solutions. This year, we're proud to welcome 17 first-time MVP Action grantees - towns and cities that are taking action to protect residents and build a more resilient community. The demand for MVP also underscores the importance of the Mass Ready Act, which will allow us to continue to support communities as they contend with increasingly destructive storms and heat.\"</p><p>MVP is a priority program of ResilientMass, the statewide climate adaptation plan to reduce risk and strengthen communities in the face of climate change impacts.</p><p>To streamline the application process for resilience projects, the next round of MVP Action Grants will be part of the new Environment and Climate One Stop. This unified application platform will allow applicants to access multiple EEA grant programs that fund climate resilience and restoration projects. This pilot initiative will be modelled after the Executive Office of Economic Development's Community One Stop for Growth. More information is available on the initiative's webpage. EEA is accepting expressions of interest for new projects at this time.</p><p>\"Communities throughout our region continue to demonstrate strong leadership in preparing for the impacts of climate change, and these MVP Action Grants provide critical resources to support those efforts,\" said Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr (R-Gloucester). \"Thank you to the Healey-Driscoll Administration for releasing this important funding for essential local initiatives in Ipswich, Salisbury, and West Newbury. These projects will not only enhance public safety and protect vital infrastructure but also strengthen the ability of our coastal and riverfront communities to withstand increasingly severe storms and flooding.\"</p><p>\"Communities across our Commonwealth are grappling with hotter summers, stronger storms, and record flooding,\" said State Senator Jo Comerford (D-Northampton). \"I am grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration for expanding the Massachusetts Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) grant program to include funding targeted for rural and small towns -- ensuring that every community has the tools it needs to meet the challenges of a changing climate. This $11.1 million investment into our rural and small municipalities is driving forward key climate resilient infrastructure projects that are designed and constructed to serve our communities and residents for the next 100 years.\"</p><p>\"Municipalities like Hull are on the front lines of climate change, and are among the first to feel the effects of sea level rise, flooding, and more intense storms,\" said State Representative Joan Meschino (D-Hull). \"MVP is a catalyst for investment in resilience, making our environments healthier and local economies stronger. We are thrilled to see this investment in the Hampton Circle neighborhood.\"</p><p>\"Two years ago, North Central Massachusetts faced devastating flooding that caused millions of dollars in damage,\" said State Representative Michael P. Kushmerek (D - Fitchburg). \"With this funding to support nature-based solutions, Fitchburg will be better equipped to manage future extreme weather events. I sincerely appreciate the Healey-Driscoll Administration for their partnership in prioritizing public safety and infrastructure investment.\"</p><p>\"The Massachusetts Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program has been a game changer for the Berkshires, giving our towns the tools to plan for and reduce the risks of climate change,\" said State Representative Leigh Davis (D - Great Barrington). \"I'm thrilled to see two Third Berkshire projects supported -- community-centered climate planning at Old Maid's Park in Great Barrington and planning for a new Regional Public Safety Facility in West Stockbridge. These investments not only help us prepare for flooding, heat, and storms, they also make our parks more accessible, our neighborhoods safer, and our communities stronger for generations to come. I'm grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration for prioritizing local climate resilience and supporting what matters most in our towns.\"</p><p>The following communities will receive funding to complete MVP Action Grants this year:</p><p>Grantee Project Title Total Amount</p><p>Abington (&amp; Rockland) Nature-Based Stormwater Resilience: Abington &amp; Rockland Watershed Assessment $350,000</p><p>Amherst (&amp; Belchertown, Hadley, Shutesbury, Pelham) Fort River Watershed Culvert Assessment &amp; Prioritization Plan $427,700</p><p>Avon From Rain to Resource: The Water Journey Innovative Solutions for Groundwater Recharge $222,700</p><p>Belchertown Hop Brook Culvert Replacement $2,764,404</p><p>Berkshire Regional Planning Commission (&amp; Clarksburg) Four Corners Floodplain Restoration and Flood Resilience Phase II (Design/Permitting) $445,020</p><p>Berkshire Regional Planning Commission (&amp; Pittsfield) Pittsfield Westside Connectivity Project $1,144,000</p><p>Berkshire Regional Planning Commission (&amp; Pittsfield, North Adams, Great Barrington, Becket) Berkshire Climate Career Lab $50,000</p><p>Boston Boston Nature Center Wetland and Stream Restoration $400,000</p><p>Brockton (&amp; Avon) D.W.

According to news reporting originating from Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Intensive anthropogenic disturbances have driven significant spatial disparities and progressive fragmentation of forest-based green infrastructure (GI) that delivers vital ecosystem services across river basins. To address these challenges, delineating ecological management zones and developing spatially targeted GI optimization measures are imperative for safeguarding regional ecological security and advancing nature-based solutions in coupled human-water-forest systems.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chongqing Social Science Planning Fund. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Zhejiang Agriculture &amp; Forestry University, \"Focused on the mainstream area of the Jialing River Basin, we establish an ecological optimization zoning system that reconciles forest ecosystem resilience with regional development equity. By using morphological spatial pattern analysis, landscape pattern analysis and the In-VEST model, the GI supply capacity was assessed from three dimensions: element composition, structural configuration, and ecosystem services. The demand intensity was evaluated based on environmental governance pressure, urban expansion demand and social development needs across counties. Supply-demand matching was analyzed using quadrant-based mismatch typology and coupling coordination degree model. The results reveal that the following: (1) supply-deficit counties are predominantly located in the middle and lower reaches of the basin, characterized by high urbanization and economic development; (2) supply-surplus and high-level balanced counties cluster in the ecologically conserved upper reaches; (3) low-level balanced counties are concentrated in agricultural zones; (4) the overall coordination degree of supply and demand show a preliminary state of coordination. Based on these findings, the basin was classified into five zones at the county level: GI restoration, management, rehabilitation, enhancement, and conservation.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Tailored ecological management measures and policies were formulated for each zone to advance sustainable basin development.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Basin Ecological Zoning Based On Supply-demand Assessment and Matching of Green Infrastructure: a Case Study of the Jialing River Basin.
