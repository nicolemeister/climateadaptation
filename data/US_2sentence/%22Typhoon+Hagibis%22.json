Here, we aimed to apply a learning-based method to detect flood-damaged areas in both built-up areas and paddy fields. The training and test datasets were derived from variations in backscattering coefficients measured by Sentinel-1 SAR before and during the flooding event. Moreover, changes in SAR data in built-up areas and paddy fields, where flood damage occurred, were used as training data.

Her skill to adapt quickly to the game was showcased, along with clever injections of speed and agility, an innate ability to read the game, and pure competitiveness.</p><p>However, it was under the tutelage of coach Tim Walsh that she came into her own. Cherry scored 33 tries during the 2013-14 series to become the first Australian to be named World Rugby Women's Sevens Player of the Year.</p><p>Two years later she was a key cog in the Australian side that dethroned New Zealand as world series champions, scoring 22 tries in the process. Better was yet to come for Cherry and her team-mates, though, as they claimed Olympic gold at Deodoro Stadium in Rio. Her contribution to that triumph included a two-try salvo against Canada in the medal semi-finals and an assist for Ellia Green in the gold medal match. Whilst her attacking skills were praised, the defensive impact she had was also a highlight of the successful campaign.</p><p>Cherry spent some time away from the game in 2019, welcoming first child, Alice and seven months post-partum she returned in prolific fashion; scoring with her first two touches of the ball in 18 months at the HSBC NZ Sevens in 2020.</p><p>In total, Cherry scored 131 tries in 159 series matches, becoming only the second female to reach 100 series tries. She is a veteran of two Rugby World Cup Sevens and a Commonwealth Games silver, as well as that Olympic triumph.</p><p>Cherry (now Barton) has since become a key part of Walsh's coaching staff for the Australia women's sevens team as assistant coach. She has utilised her considerable experience and knowledge of the game being involved with both the RWC Sevens 2022 and Commonwealth Games successes as well as the Olympic Games Paris 2024 campaign.</p><p>DJ Forbes (New Zealand)</p><p>World Rugby Hall of Fame Inductee No.168</p><p>A genuine sevens superstar, DJ Forbes was the fulcrum of one of the most successful New Zealand sides for more than a decade. Having made his HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series debut in Wellington in February 2006, Forbes and his distinctive beard were a mainstay on the circuit until he hung up his playing boots in May 2017.</p><p>Along the way he appeared in 89 series tournaments playing 512 matches on the circuit scoring 153 tries and amassing a shedload of medals. In total, Forbes won 26 tournaments, six overall series titles, one Commonwealth Games gold medal in 2010, silver in 2014 and a Rugby World Cup Sevens title in 2013.</p><p>He was also named World Rugby Men's Sevens Player of the Year in 2008, following a campaign in which he scored 26 tries and led New Zealand to six tournament victories en route to their eighth series title.</p><p>That Forbes achieved most of that as New Zealand captain, wearing the armband between 2006-15, receiving the New Zealand Sevens Player of the Year a record four times and accepting the NZRPA Kirk Award in 2017 for his outstanding contribution as a player advocate for the game, only adds to his legend.</p><p>Forbes gave up the captaincy in the build-up to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games in order to concentrate on earning his place in the tournament squad. It was a feat he inevitably achieved, going on to appear in all six of his country's matches as New Zealand finished the inaugural men's Olympic sevens tournament in fifth place.</p><p>Forbes is the nephew of late Samoa great and World Rugby Hall of Fame inductee Peter Fatialofa, who captained the Pacific Island nation to the Rugby World Cup 1991 quarter-finals.</p><p>Sergio Parisse (Italy)</p><p>World Rugby Hall of Fame Inductee No.169</p><p>Arguably Italy's greatest player and one of the best number eights the game has ever seen, Sergio Parisse had an incredible career that spanned more than two decades.</p><p>With his white boots and ability to offload and break the line Parisse was not your conventional forward, but he won the respect of rugby fans the world over for his dynamic displays from the back of the scrum, often single-handedly lifting the Azzurri to greater heights.</p><p>Born in Argentina to Italian parents, Italy's talisman was handed his debut by John Kirwan, against the All Blacks in 2002. Only three players Alun Wyn Jones, Samuel Whitelock and Richie McCaw have made more test appearances than his final tally of 142.</p><p>One of the select few, including countryman Mauro Bergamasco, to have played in five Rugby World Cups, Parisse was denied what would have been a fitting swansong at Japan 2019 when Italy's Pool B match against the All Blacks was unfortunately cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>While he never graced the test arena again beyond that tournament, the supremely fit back-row continued playing club rugby until he was 39. In his penultimate game for Toulon, the former Italy captain lifted the European Rugby Challenge Cup, scoring in the final against Glasgow Warriors.</p><p>It was his exploits for Stade Francais, though, that he was best known, his poster boy image aligning perfectly with the bold-thinking Parisian club.</p><p>Parisse stayed with Stade Francais for the majority of his domestic career. Between 2005 and 2019, he made 265 appearances for the club and won the Top 14 title twice and the European Rugby Challenge Cup once.</p><p>He is the first Italian to be inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.</p><p>Donna Kennedy (Scotland)</p><p>World Rugby Hall of Fame Inductee No.170</p><p>Scotland's most-capped player, male or female, Donna Kennedy was synonymous with the country's women's national team for much of the first two decades of its existence.</p><p>Kennedy made her test debut in Scotland's first-ever international, lining up in the second row and helping her country to a 10-0 victory against Ireland on Valentine's Day in 1993. A year later she appeared in her first Women's Rugby World Cup, on home soil, and she would go on to play at five editions of the showpiece tournament.</p><p>In 2004, Kennedy displayed her versatility as she moved out of the Scotland back row where she had become a mainstay to win four caps on the wing. That year she was also named World Rugby's International Women's Personality of the Year and became the world's most-capped women's player, overtaking England's Gill Burns when she played her 74th test.</p><p>Kennedy would stretch that record before she hung up her boots at the end of Women's Rugby World Cup 2010. By that time, the Biggar native who played 95 of Scotland's first 100 test matches had amassed 115 caps, all from the start, as she became the first Scottish player to rack up a century of international appearances.</p><p>She would remain the world's most-capped female player until England's Rocky Clark surpassed her total in November 2016.</p><p>Following her playing career, Kennedy remained involved with the game as a coach with the Scottish Rugby Union and later took charge of English club Worcester before stepping down from that role in 2017.</p><p>The Donna Kennedy Cup was named in her honour in 2015 and ahead of the Guinness Women's Six Nations 2024 she was one of three trailblazers of Scottish women's rugby celebrated with a statue in Edinburgh.</p><p>In 2023, Kennedy co-founded the Scottish Thistle Rugby Clan with the key purpose being to support the past, present and future of the game within Scotland, holding their first event jointly the Wooden Spoons in April 2023 at Murrayfield.</p><p>Chris Laidlaw (New Zealand)</p><p>World Rugby Hall of Fame Inductee No.171</p><p>Considered something of a rugby prodigy in his youth, Chris Laidlaw would fulfil his undoubted potential both on and off the pitch. One of the greatest scrum-halves to ever pull on an All Black number nine jersey, he has gone on to have an influential and varied career outside of the game.

A new study - published today in the journal Climatic Change - found that the storm was about 67 percent more likely to happen than it would have been in a world without climate change. Researchers also went a step further, and translated the influence of warming into economic costs: Of the $10 billion Typhoon Hagibis caused in damages, they estimate that about $4 billion can be attributed to climate change. In other words, if global warming weren't happening, the storm would have been far less destructive. </p><p>\"We focused on this specific event because Hagibis was one of the most damaging storms in Japan's history,\" said lead study author Sihan Li, a senior research associate at Oxford University. In fact, it was likely even more damaging than the new study suggests. The research looks only at costs associated with insured losses. It doesn't include the variety of costs that may be associated with other consequences of the storm, including loss of life and well-being. The study is the latest addition to a popular field of research known as attribution science. The field specializes in uncovering the influence of climate change on individual weather events, like hurricanes, heat waves, floods and wildfires. While attribution science is a relatively young field - it got its start only about two decades ago - it has rapidly advanced in recent years. There are hundreds of peer-reviewed attribution studies published in the scientific literature today. Scientists can now investigate almost any type of climate-related disaster, and they've gotten faster at it, as well. Studies that previously might have taken weeks or months to complete can now be conducted in nearly real time. And the field is still evolving. Typical attribution studies focus solely on the way climate change has influenced the likelihood or the intensity of a given weather event. Looking at economic costs is a relatively new development - so far, only a few studies have done so. But today's study on Typhoon Hagibis won't be the last. Calculating the 'cost of inaction' A 2020 study on droughts and floods in New Zealand, both led by climate scientist David Frame, established a basic methodology for linking weather-related damages to climate change. The method essentially investigates the influence of warming on the probability of a given event occurring, by now a well-established practice in attribution science. Then it takes the fraction of risk attributable to climate change and applies it to the costs associated with that event. The Hurricane Harvey study, for instance, found that warming probably accounts for about three-quarters of the risk of such a severe event occurring. The researchers then concluded that about three-quarters of Harvey's estimated $90 billion in damages can be attributed to climate change, or around $67 billion. The Harvey study focused primarily on the way climate change affected the storm's legendary rainfall, which was responsible for most of the destructive flooding it caused along the Gulf Coast in 2017. A 2021 study on Superstorm Sandy, on the other hand, took a slightly different approach. Much of the destruction wrought by Sandy, which battered the Northeast in 2012, was caused by storm surge - the water flooding in from the ocean when a storm strikes the shore. Higher sea levels are linked to more damaging storm surge. So the Sandy study investigated the influence of climate-driven sea-level rise on the floods associated with the storm. Then it translated that influence into economic costs, concluding that around $8 billion in damages can be blamed on climate change. The new study on Typhoon Hagibis uses a method similar to the Hurricane Harvey study. Much of the typhoon's damages were associated with the storm's strong rainfall. It's a relatively easy and straightforward method, said study co-author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and co-lead of the research consortium World Weather Attribution, which specializes in attribution science. Still, she said, the field would benefit from more studies exploring more potential methods linking weather-related costs to climate change. Since it's still a relatively new kind of research, it has a lot of room to develop. \"I think it would be really good if we had more people working on this and had more people coming up with different ways of doing it to see how robust these results are, depending on what kind of methodologies you choose,\" she said. These types of studies could potentially have wide-ranging implications beyond their scientific value. Legal experts have often suggested that attribution studies, in general, could be used as evidence in climate-related lawsuits. Studies pointing specifically to the influence of climate change on economic costs might have an even greater potential to influence climate litigation and policy down the line. But the field probably needs to mature a bit more first, Otto said. Typical attribution studies, which don't look at costs, have well-established standard methods. These methods have been used in hundreds of studies and have been evaluated by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Adding damages into the mix, on the other hand, is a new frontier. \"I think if you were to go to court right now, someone could easily poke holes in it,\" Otto said. \"For it to be actually really useful in all the contexts you would want to use it, we need more people working on [it] and more people doing it.\" Climate litigation is just one possible arena where these kinds of studies could be useful. They also have great potential to influence the public perception of climate change and its associated risks, Li suggested. \"I think we still severely underestimate how much climate change actually costs,\" she said. Storms like Hagibis are likely to grow more destructive as the world continues to warm, she said. The same is true of many other kinds of climate-related disasters all over the world. Curbing emissions and halting global warming as quickly as possible can limit the growing costs associated with these events. Studies that directly link the costs of individual weather events to climate change may make the issue feel more tangible to the public, Li suggested. \"I think that is really a missing piece in what we need to maybe act a bit faster,\" she said. \"People think about the cost of mitigation, but never really about the cost of inaction.\"</p>", "publisher": "ClimateWire", "instances": ["A new study - published today in the journal Climatic Change - found that the storm was about 67 percent more likely to happen than it would have been in a world without climate change.

Some enter [the field] through the sport sciences side - kinesiology, physiology, coaching - others begin in natural resource science, environmental studies, hydrology or climatology, and then find their way to sport as the topic.</p><p>My training combined a bit of both and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to study across different faculties when I was in graduate school to learn how to read, interpret and develop climate models, and also how to measure the impacts of different climate hazards like extreme heat, humidity or wildfire on athletes' health and performance, and the business side of sports.</p><p>How is climate change changing sport, directly and indirectly?</p><p>I spend about 200 pages of my book answering that question - but if I had to split it into a few buckets, it would be that: extreme heat is impacting athlete health and performance, and the well-being of everybody else around sport, including coaches, referees and fans; drought and floods are creating unstable and sometimes unhealthy playing surfaces in different parts of the world; wildfires are wreaking havoc on air pollution across huge swaths of land even far from the flames; and winters are getting shorter and less predictable due to climate change - so winter sports are suffering.</p><p>Climate change is important to think about in the context of sport because every single sport is dependent on clean air, clean water and a safe place to play. When climate hazards crop up, they can lead to cancelations, delays, damages, health issues and, in worst-case-scenarios, death for athletes.</p><p>Is sport itself contributing negatively to the environment?</p><p>Sport - especially at the elite and professional levels - is organized geographically and based on inter-regional and international travel. The business model of sport is based on tourism: the teams and events want people to come in from out of town, or to spend money at restaurants and other hospitality offerings near the venue. So, when lots of people - teams, referees, media and fans - move around, it creates a pretty significant carbon footprint.</p><p>And in another sense, sport produces a lot of waste. Think of how many sports products are made from carbon fibre, just to name one example. It's in our hockey sticks, bikes, bats, boats, skis, racquets, nets and the list goes on. It's a great product because it's strong and light, but it's also not recyclable, so once a piece of carbon fibre equipment gets even a tiny crack, it becomes unplayable and in the case of bikes or boats, it has to be retired immediately for safety reasons.</p><p>Another example is sports gear. Think of all the clothing and shoes that we buy to support our sport practices - most of it is made from polyester because it wicks sweat. But it's also made from plastic and is very hard to recycle, even if the product you buy says, \"Made from recycled materials.\" Polyester can generally be recycled once and then it starts becoming tricky to do it again as the quality of the material degenerates. All this to say, sport produces a lot of stuff that can't be recycled or reused, and that's a huge source of waste.</p><p>How can sport organizations, managers, coaches, athletes and fans mitigate the risks associated with climate change and reduce their own environmental footprint?</p><p>That's a huge question, and I spent a lot of pages on this in the book. The first big thing is that we have to put safety first and adopt policies and emergency protocols that keep athletes - and staff, coaches, fans, volunteers - safe when they're playing sport in unsafe conditions like extreme heat or wildfire smoke. The other piece will be to adapt our facilities and our schedules to avoid the worst of the climate hazards.</p><p>Reducing the environmental footprint usually has to do with reducing travel, whether it's carpooling to practices with other kids on your team or taking public transit to pro sport events when you go to watch. But there are lots of other things individuals and sport organizations can do with regards to reuse and recycling that I discuss in the book as well.</p><p>How do you maintain your optimism?</p><p>I don't think we can afford not to change. We just have to. And I'm under no illusion that sport - especially pro and elite sport - is going to be the first mover on this, but this sector does have a huge platform and potential to inspire not only fans who follow, but all of its supply chains. When sport has used that platform in the past, it's ignited major public conversations about issues like gender equity -think of Billie Jean King or the more recent work of women's soccer teams. And racial injustice - think the 2020 Black Lives Matter boycotts and before that Colin Kaepernick, and before that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Sport has a rich history of drawing attention to big debates and discussions. And I think we can do that again with climate change.</p><p>Finally, how do you respond to people who say to athlete activists to \"stay in their lane?\"</p><p>There are always going to be trolls and haters. I say ignore them. George Monbiot, an environment reporter for The Guardian, once said, \"We are hypocrites. Every one of us, almost by definition. Hypocrisy is the gap between your aspirations and your actions.\" And that resonates with me. I try to remind athletes or other activists that nobody would pass a purity test on climate action: we've all got a carbon footprint and we all have agency to make some choices that are more sustainable, but not all choices - because some are expensive and some are just out of our control. So, let yourself off the hook of being perfect, continue to communicate your concerns to the world and ignore the trolls.</p><p>Read the full interview at the Faculty of Kinesiology &amp; Physical Education (<url normalizedValue=\"https://kpe.utoronto.ca/faculty-news/how-climate-change-changing-sport-q-and-sport-ecologist-madeleine-orr\">https://kpe.utoronto.ca/faculty-news/how-climate-change-changing-sport-q-and-sport-ecologist-madeleine-orr</url>)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.utoronto.ca/news/warming-u-t-researcher-explores-impact-climate-change-sports\">https://www.utoronto.ca/news/warming-u-t-researcher-explores-impact-climate-change-sports</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8606896 MSTRUCK</p>", "publisher": "Targeted News Service", "instances": ["(TNSres) -- The University of Toronto issued the following news:By Jelena DamjanovicIn 2019, a world championship marathon in Doha was scheduled at midnight to avoid the blistering sun.

According to news reporting from Sendai, Japan, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"We propose a method for evaluating the risks of slope failure induced by heavy rain over a wide area by combining infiltration analysis, surface flow analysis, and slope stability analysis based on three-dimensional limit equilibrium method. The influence of the resolution of terrain data is also examined.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from JST SPRING. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Tohoku University, \"To determine rainfall-induced water transportation, we employ an infiltration analysis, using the Green-Ampt model, and a surface flow analysis, using the diffusion wave model. For the slope stability analysis, a three-dimensional arc -slip calculation applying the Hovland method is used. The infiltration depth is obtained from the results of the infiltration analysis, whereas the simulated data are used as input data for the slope stability analysis. A region in Kamaishi City, Iwate Prefecture, Japan, where slope failures were observed during typhoon Hagibis on October 12 and 13, 2019, is selected in this study as the target area and a series of analyses are performed. The topo-graphical survey data by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) observed before and after the typhoon are used to identify the actual collapse locations and compare them with the results of the slope stability analysis. In addition, high-resolution topographic data of the target area using UAV data is created and differences in the factor of safety distribution with and without the UAV data for terrain data are compared and discussed. The obtained results revealed that the proposed method can roughly represent the actual slope failure, which is useful for evaluating rainfall-induced slope failure hazards.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The results derived from utilizing detailed terrain data by UAV show the importance of using a high-resolution terrain model for evaluating the stability of micro -topography, such as forest roads.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Limit Equilibrium Method-based 3d Slope Stability Analysis for Wide Area Considering Influence of Rainfall.

In an effort to furnish humanitarian organizations and government agencies alike with better information, Facebook today launched a new version of its Displacement Maps that calculates displacement levels on a daily cadence. The improved Displacement Maps \u2014 which come roughly a year after the initial version was released as a part of Facebook's Disaster Maps product suite \u2014 was co-developed by the Norwegian Refugee Council's Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, which offer s data and analysis on internal displacement. </p><p>They tap aggregated and de-identified data from users of Facebook's cross-platform apps who have opted into location history. 'Partners such as SEEDS India and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health have used previous versions of our displacement maps for disaster response and public health research, and we hope that our full list of over 100 NGO and research partners will be able to leverage these new maps to fulfill their missions,' wrote[1] Facebook researchers Eugenia Giraudy, Paige Maas, Shankar Iyer, Alex Dow, Alex Pompe. 'As climate change increases the frequency and severity of natural disasters, response organizations require improved data to better understand the dynamics of weather-based displacement.' The social network says it analyzes the patterns of people in areas affected by natural disasters that exhibit 'abrupt changes' in their movement patterns, aggregated to a city level. To establish a baseline, Displacement Maps first analyzes normal movement patterns in the 30-day period before the crisis. Then, it looks at patterns in the two-week period after the crisis and compares them with the pre-crisis patterns, calculating and comparing people's home location and their typical distance traveled away from home for both time periods. Above: Displacement trends from Tokyo after Typhoon Hagibis, as tracked by Displacement Maps. Image Credit: FacebookDisplacement Maps now defines populations as 'displaced' if they reside at least two kilometers (roughly 1.2 miles) away from their pre-crisis home, and if the distance traveled away from their pre-crises home location has doubled. It considers populations 'never displaced' if either of the aforementioned conditions aren't met, and 'unknown' if people haven't connected to Facebook at least three days in the two-week period post-crisis. Starting on day 15 after the crisis, Displacement Maps generates daily updates of the population status to count the number of people displaced and returned within and across cities, aggregating to a country level when the city count is too low. People originally classified as displaced are considered 'returned' once they're observed for three days in a row less than two kilometers away from their home. Facebook says that the improved Displacement Maps have been applied to Cyclone Fani in India and Bangladesh, where they've helped to show that areas like Bhubaneswar experienced a 15% displacement compared with cities near the Kolkata area, which experienced only 1% to 2% displacement. Applied to Typhoon Hagibis, which hit Japan in October 2019, Displacement Maps revealed large numbers of people leaving the Tokyo area.

It's getting stronger,\" said the 70-year-old farmer in Okutama, west of downtown Tokyo. <br/>\"Since it's happened once, there's no guarantee it won't happen again.\" <br/>Wasabi, the tangy Japanese horseradish that's an essential part of sushi and dabbed onto slices of raw fish or into bowls of soba buckwheat noodle soup, is usually grown along streams in narrow valleys, leaving farms prone to disasters. <br/>Typhoon Hagibis, which slammed into eastern Japan in 2019, slashed production in Okutama by nearly 70% the next year. The need for replanting and careful tending meant it's taken nearly three years for sushi farms there to recover. (Photo essay: https://reut.rs/3AFtYSQ) <br/>Experts say global warming is affecting production not only by increasing the number and severity of storms, but with rising temperatures that threaten growth of the plants, which need to be in water a consistent 10-15 degrees C year-round. <br/>A lack of wasabi could also endanger traditional Japanese foods such as sushi and sashimi, where the tang of the wasabi is used as a contrast with raw fish. <br/>Weather isn't the only obstacle wasabi farmers face. A drop in rural populations due to aging means there are no successors. Because of the two factors, the output of wasabi grown in clear-flowing water, like at Hoshina's farm, had fallen to half that of 2005, according to the Agriculture Ministry. <br/>Norihito Onishi, head sales manager at a chain of soba buckwheat noodle restaurants called Sojibo, has seen his business directly affected by wasabi shortages and supply problems. <br/>The restaurants were long known for allowing customers to grind their own wasabi roots to produce the spicy paste used as a condiment for soba. But they've had to mostly give this up. <br/>\"In the past, we served all the cold soba noodles with a piece of raw wasabi, but now we can no longer do that,\" Onishi said. <br/>Though wasabi root was plentiful when the restaurant first opened 30 years ago, Onishi said over the last 5 to 10 years there have been times when he couldn't get any at all. The precious root is now made available only for certain types of dishes. <br/>\"If this unstable supply of wasabi persists, due to many factors including global warming, we will face a situation where we need to come up with other ways to overcome the problem so we don't end up not serving raw wasabi at all,\" said Onishi. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Cherry blossoms are blooming sooner than ever before, chiffon-pink that's traditionally heralded spring for the nation popping up just two weeks into March. In Osaka, temperatures soared to 77 degrees Fahrenheit on March 22, a record for that time of year. Tottori, in the southwest, hit 78 F on the same day, the highest in 140 years, according to climatologist Maximiliano Herrera. </p><p>Tottori's temperatures usually hover around 54 F in March. With thermometers already shooting upward and fossil fuel use that feeds climate change still creeping up around the world, Japan is set for another sweltering summer and is at growing risk of flooding and landslides. The nation is scrambling to protect communities from warming and has pledged to slash emissions, but in the short term the worsening weather remains a threat. \"The risks from climate change are right before us,\" said Yasuaki Hijioka, deputy director of the Center for Climate Change Adaptation at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo. \"You can in principle try escaping from a flood. But heat affects such a wide area, there is almost no escape,\" Hijioka said. \"Everyone is affected.\" Japan is already prone to natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons. Secure infrastructure has kept people safe for the most part. But climate change means communities are often caught off-guard because the systems were engineered for the weather conditions of the past. \"If you're pushing the electrical grid that was designed for the 20th century into a new century of warming and heat extremes, then you are going to have to consider whether your energy system and your health care system are really designed for a warming planet,\" said Kim Cobb, director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. More people are getting sick because of heat troke. Last year, more than 200 temperature records were broken in cities across the nation, sending energy grid to near-capacity and over 71,000 people to hospital for heatstroke through the months of May to September. Patients were mostly elderly, but a fair number of children and middle-aged adults were also hospitalized, according to government figures. Eighty people died. The warming weather can also hold more moisture, adding flooding and landslides to the summer forecast, something that Japan has also seen with growing frequency. In 2019, bullet trains were partially submerged in flooding from Typhoon Hagibis. Homes and highways were caught in landslides. Flooded tunnels trapped people and cars. Dams couldn't withstand the surprisingly heavy rainfall. Hijioka's research is focused on flood management, such as diverting water from swelling rivers upstream into rice paddies and ponds to drain to avert flooding. To prevent deaths from heatstroke, a proposed law would designate certain buildings in communities, such as air-conditioned libraries, as shelters. That kind of law on the national level is new in Japan. Despite the country's advanced economy, some people cannot afford air conditioning, especially in areas not accustomed to the heat. Schools in northern Japan, such as in Nagano, have installed air conditioning because of the extreme heat in recent years. \"More people have been dying from heatstroke than from river flooding in Japan,\" said Hijioka. \"We need to view climate change as a natural disaster.\" Michio Kawamiya, director of the Research Center for Environmental Modeling and Application, and his team research Japan's higher temperatures and how they affect people. Among their findings: Since 1953, cherry blossoms have bloomed on average one day sooner every decade. Maple leaves have changed color 2.8 days slower per decade. The risk of typhoons has gone up and the amount of snowfall has declined, even as the threat of heavy snowfall remains. Japan has made some headway in curbing the amount of fossil fuels it spews, but it's still the world's sixth-highest emitter. After the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the country shut down nuclear generation, and, fatefully for the climate, invested in new coal plants as well as imported oil and gas to keep its grid running. Nuclear plants have gradually restarted since then. On the positive side, its excellent public mass-transit transportation has kept gas-guzzling cars off roads, lowering the country's carbon footprint. Some Japanese people have been turning their air conditioning off to save energy, but that has health implications, as it comes precisely at a time when heat has been reaching dangerously high levels. The country has already worked so hard to conserve energy by reducing demand that doing more has often been compared to \"wringing water out of a totally dry rag,\" Kawamiya said in an interview at his office in Yokohama, southwest of Tokyo. Still, critics say Japan could be doing more to boost renewable energy use, such as solar and wind power. The government plans for renewables to make up over a third of the country's power supply by 2030 and to phase out coal use sometime in the 2040s. Japan is also part of the Group of Seven leading economies that pledged to be largely free of fossil fuels for electricity by 2035. Since Fukushima, Japan has kept most of the nation's 50-some nuclear reactors offline, in response to public opinion that's turned against the technology. Nuclear power is considered a clean energy as it doesn't emit greenhouse gases, but it does produce radioactive waste. About 10 reactors are up and running, and 24 reactors are being decommissioned. What Japan will eventually decide on nuclear power remains unclear.

This year, India saw its hottest March, and Pakistan along with parts of India had their hottest April. The record heat has continued this month as well. <br/>What they found: The study examines the shifting probability of exceeding the record-breaking temperatures seen in April and May of 2010. It shows the probability of setting such records without human influence is about once in 312 years.But due to climate change, this has ballooned to once every 3 years.By the end of the century, this level of heat, with widespread temperatures at or above 120F, may be an annual occurrence. Meanwhile, a separate study[3] examined one of Japan's most damaging typhoons on record, 2019's Typhoon Hagibis, which brought devastating flooding. <br/>Threat level: The study, from researchers affiliated with the international World Weather Attribution[4] effort, found that human emissions of greenhouse gases made the extreme rainfall as the storm made landfall 67% more likely. In a stark finding, the study concluded that the effects of climate change boosted the storm's damage by at least $4 billion out of the $10 billion in insured losses. Zoom in: The dollar figure attribution stands out in the emerging field of extreme event research, which works to reveal how global warming is shifting the odds of the occurrence and/or severity of heat waves, floods and other major events. For the new research, scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College London studied rainfall amounts from the storm, and used computer models to compare how likely the deluge is in a world warmed by greenhouse gas emissions compared to one without human influence.As air warms, it is able to hold more water vapor that can then fuel storms and yield much heavier precipitation totals.A 2020 study[5] found that $67 billion of Hurricane Harvey's damage could be pinned on climate change. The bottom line: 'The negative consequences of the continued burning of fossil fuels are now evident and can be felt also in wealthy countries like Japan,\" Friederike Otto, who leads the World Weather Attribution effort, said in a statement. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWV0b2ZmaWNlLmdvdi51ay9iaW5hcmllcy9jb250ZW50L2Fzc2V0cy9tZXRvZmZpY2Vnb3Z1ay9wZGYvcmVzZWFyY2gvY2xpbWF0ZS1zY2llbmNlL2F0dHJpYnV0aW9uL2luZGlhbl9oZWF0d2F2ZV8yMDIyLnBkZj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB9887430a\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWV0b2ZmaWNlLmdvdi51ay9iaW5hcmllcy9jb250ZW50L2Fzc2V0cy9tZXRvZmZpY2Vnb3Z1ay9wZGYvcmVzZWFyY2gvY2xpbWF0ZS1zY2llbmNlL2F0dHJpYnV0aW9uL2luZGlhbl9oZWF0d2F2ZV8yMDIyLnBkZj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB9887430a</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDIvaW5kaWEtcGFraXN0YW4taGVhdC13YXZlLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLXJlY29yZHM_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB3ea75c71\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDIvaW5kaWEtcGFraXN0YW4taGVhdC13YXZlLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLXJlY29yZHM_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB3ea75c71</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGR3ZWF0aGVyYXR0cmlidXRpb24ub3JnL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWFkZGVkLTRibi10by1kYW1hZ2Utb2YtamFwYW5zLXR5cGhvb24taGFnaWJpcy8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB85e6476c\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGR3ZWF0aGVyYXR0cmlidXRpb24ub3JnL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWFkZGVkLTRibi10by1kYW1hZ2Utb2YtamFwYW5zLXR5cGhvb24taGFnaWJpcy8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB85e6476c</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGR3ZWF0aGVyYXR0cmlidXRpb24ub3JnLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB84360e15\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGR3ZWF0aGVyYXR0cmlidXRpb24ub3JnLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB84360e15</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rLnNwcmluZ2VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwLjEwMDcvczEwNTg0LTAyMC0wMjY5Mi04P3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zZ2VuZXJhdGUmc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB8cbc5d69\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rLnNwcmluZ2VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwLjEwMDcvczEwNTg0LTAyMC0wMjY5Mi04P3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zZ2VuZXJhdGUmc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB8cbc5d69</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

This year, India saw its hottest March, and Pakistan along with parts of India had their hottest April. The record heat has continued this month as well. <br/>What they found: The study examines the shifting probability of exceeding the record-breaking temperatures seen in April and May of 2010. It shows the probability of setting such records without human influence is about once in 312 years.But due to climate change, this has ballooned to once every 3 years.By the end of the century, this level of heat, with widespread temperatures at or above 120F, may be an annual occurrence. Meanwhile, a separate study[3] examined one of Japan's most damaging typhoons on record, 2019's Typhoon Hagibis, which brought devastating flooding. <br/>Threat level: The study, from researchers affiliated with the international World Weather Attribution[4] effort, found that human emissions of greenhouse gases made the extreme rainfall as the storm made landfall 67% more likely. In a stark finding, the study concluded that the effects of climate change boosted the storm's damage by at least $4 billion out of the $10 billion in insured losses. Zoom in: The dollar figure attribution stands out in the emerging field of extreme event research, which works to reveal how global warming is shifting the odds of the occurrence and/or severity of heat waves, floods and other major events. For the new research, scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College London studied rainfall amounts from the storm, and used computer models to compare how likely the deluge is in a world warmed by greenhouse gas emissions compared to one without human influence.As air warms, it is able to hold more water vapor that can then fuel storms and yield much heavier precipitation totals.A 2020 study[5] found that $67 billion of Hurricane Harvey's damage could be pinned on climate change. The bottom line: 'The negative consequences of the continued burning of fossil fuels are now evident and can be felt also in wealthy countries like Japan,\" Friederike Otto, who leads the World Weather Attribution effort, said in a statement. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWV0b2ZmaWNlLmdvdi51ay9iaW5hcmllcy9jb250ZW50L2Fzc2V0cy9tZXRvZmZpY2Vnb3Z1ay9wZGYvcmVzZWFyY2gvY2xpbWF0ZS1zY2llbmNlL2F0dHJpYnV0aW9uL2luZGlhbl9oZWF0d2F2ZV8yMDIyLnBkZj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB9887430a\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWV0b2ZmaWNlLmdvdi51ay9iaW5hcmllcy9jb250ZW50L2Fzc2V0cy9tZXRvZmZpY2Vnb3Z1ay9wZGYvcmVzZWFyY2gvY2xpbWF0ZS1zY2llbmNlL2F0dHJpYnV0aW9uL2luZGlhbl9oZWF0d2F2ZV8yMDIyLnBkZj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB9887430a</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDIvaW5kaWEtcGFraXN0YW4taGVhdC13YXZlLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLXJlY29yZHM_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB3ea75c71\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDIvaW5kaWEtcGFraXN0YW4taGVhdC13YXZlLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLXJlY29yZHM_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB3ea75c71</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGR3ZWF0aGVyYXR0cmlidXRpb24ub3JnL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWFkZGVkLTRibi10by1kYW1hZ2Utb2YtamFwYW5zLXR5cGhvb24taGFnaWJpcy8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB85e6476c\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGR3ZWF0aGVyYXR0cmlidXRpb24ub3JnL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWFkZGVkLTRibi10by1kYW1hZ2Utb2YtamFwYW5zLXR5cGhvb24taGFnaWJpcy8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB85e6476c</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGR3ZWF0aGVyYXR0cmlidXRpb24ub3JnLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB84360e15\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGR3ZWF0aGVyYXR0cmlidXRpb24ub3JnLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB84360e15</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rLnNwcmluZ2VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwLjEwMDcvczEwNTg0LTAyMC0wMjY5Mi04P3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zZ2VuZXJhdGUmc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB8cbc5d69\">https://link.axios.com/click/27765569.4405/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rLnNwcmluZ2VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwLjEwMDcvczEwNTg0LTAyMC0wMjY5Mi04P3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zZ2VuZXJhdGUmc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/5874ee3c0aea11c30c8b4e1eB8cbc5d69</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Key items affecting the fourth quarter include: Prior accident year losses of approximately $77M or 18 points on Argo's consolidated loss ratio for the Q4. Reserve increases were related to the company's London, Bermuda Insurance and European business units within Argo's International Operations, as well as property, professional and liability lines within Argo's U.S. Operations. Prior accident year losses in both segments were the result of new information received in the quarter relating to claims trends across various lines of business, as well as a continued review of International business currently in run-off. </p><p>Prior year losses also include the conclusion of Argo's annual review of run-off reserves, which resulted in a $10M reserve increase. Current accident year losses of approximately $30M, or an additional six points when compared to Q3 year-to-date current accident year loss ratio of 59%. The adjustment reflects a change in actuarial estimates based on a more uncertain claims environment and the recalibration of the current year based on prior accident year loss adjustments. Catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums of approximately $3M, or 0.5 points on Argo's consolidated loss ratio for Q4. Catastrophe losses were primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis and were partially offset by a modest reduction to estimated losses for prior quarter events. Additional operating expenses of approximately $12M or 2.9 points related to costs associated with a reduction in workforce, an allowance for doubtful accounts related to our European business unit, and adjustments to underwriting expenses based on certain costs previously allocated to investment functions and trade capital providers. Based on these items discussed above, Argo expects to report an underwriting loss of approximately $114M for the quarter. Additionally, several non-operating charges will be reflected in fourth quarter results: As part of an ongoing strategic review and recent operating results, a goodwill impairment of approximately $16M related to Argo's European business unit. Expenses of approximately $18M related to losses and impairments on certain long-lived assets that are held for sale, primarily a corporate aircraft and real estate properties; the cancellation of contracts related to certain sponsorships and marketing services; and to severance costs associated with separation from Argo's former CEO. Other corporate expenses of approximately $8M, which primarily resulted from costs related to the previously announced independent directors' review of certain governance and compensation matters and Argo's cooperation agreement with Voce Capital. |</p>", "publisher": "Theflyonthewall.com", "instances": ["Catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums of approximately $3M, or 0. 5 points on Argo's consolidated loss ratio for Q4.

Nearly 3 trillion yen ($28 billion) will be spent on vaccine research and the cash handouts to medical workers.</p><p>Japan's move is one of the latest efforts by countries to unleash a massive amount of government spending aimed at helping households and businesses cope with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>China promised last Friday to throw 3.6 trillion yuan ($500 billion) at its economy this year in extra stimulus measures as part of a bid to create 9 million jobs and blunt the impact from the pandemic.

While Japan has suffered from a number of TC impacts throughout its history, meteorological data for these events has been sparse.</p><p>The team, including Specially Appointed Associate Professor Hisayuki Kubota of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, investigated TC activity over the western North Pacific and TC landfalls in Japan by analyzing a combination of TC tracking and meteorological data observed at weather stations and lighthouses, including rescued and recovered historical observations.</p><p>The team has collected and recovered TC track and landfall data and meteorological observations in the mid-19th century and later through an approach that rescues, collects and digitizes weather data across the world that has been stored away and often forgotten. To give the data useful consistency, the team developed a new, unified definition for TCs, based on minimum pressure.</p><p>According to their analysis, TC landfall locations tend to shift to the northeast and then southwest regions of Japan at roughly 100-year intervals. The analysis also shows that annual TC landfall numbers and their intensities have been increasing in recent years, while noting that these increases may be part of an oscillated fluctuation operating on interdecadal time scales.</p><p>The landfall numbers were relatively small in the late 20th century, and larger at other times. The Tohoku and Hokkaido regions, which experienced small numbers of TC landfalls in the late 20th century, may experience more landfalls in the future.</p><p>Japan's first official meteorological observation was conducted in Hakodate, Hokkaido, in 1872. There is very little earlier meteorological data obtained by meteorological instruments at terrestrial stations, which makes it difficult to perform long-term meteorological variability analyses. In a new approach, the team focused on foreign ship log weather records from the mid-19th century made with meteorological instruments on vessels sailing through East- and Southeast Asian waters.</p><p>The team used records from the US Navy expedition fleet to Japan led by Commodore Matthew C. Perry and from British Navy ships that also sailed to Japan to accurately identify the track of a TC moving over the ocean around the Okinawa Islands from 21 to 25 July 1853, and the track of a TC moving north over the East China Sea from 15 to 16 August 1863.</p><p>The results of the study show for the first time the usefulness of such marine data in identifying weather patterns after the mid-19th century in Asia, where there is much less meteorological data for that time period compared with Western countries. \"It is projected that stronger TCs will hit Japan in the future due to global warming. The long-term data from our research is indispensable for knowing the variabilities of TC activities in the past and to prepare for future TCs,\" says Hisayuki Kubota.</p><p>Original Article:</p><p>Hisayuki Kubota, et al.

The match was also notable for Emily Scarratt's achievement in becoming England's record points-scorer.</p><p>World Rugby Tbilisi Cup 2015</p><p>An intense downpour turned the Vere river that runs through Tbilisi into a sweeping torrent, causing death and destruction. The floodwater was so fierce it burst open enclosures at the city's zoo, leaving dangerous animals, including lions, bears and a hippopotamus, to run amok. The following Monday was declared a national day of mourning.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, a decision was taken to proceed with the second round of the Tbilisi Cup, as the Avchala Stadium was located 15km north of the city centre in an unaffected area. Emerging Ireland beat Uruguay 33-7 before going on to claim the silverware with a 45-12 win over the host nation in the final round of the tournament.</p><p>Ireland 20-14 England, Six Nations 20 October, 2001, Dublin</p><p>An outbreak of foot-and-mouth in the UK a highly contagious disease amongst livestock forced the postponement of Ireland's final three Six Nations fixtures of the spring to autumn slots. England had won all four of their matches by an average margin of 29 points up to that point and were playing some of their best-attacking rugby. However, the delay halted their momentum and Ireland did a number on them when the match eventually took place in October.</p><p>South Africa 19-15 France, RWC 1995 17 June, 1995, Durban</p><p>The normally sun-drenched coastal city of Durban was subjected to a deluge on the day of the first semi-final of RWC 1995 between hosts South and France. After consulting the meteorological office, the kick-off was delayed by 90 minutes to give locals a chance to sweep surface water off the pitch.</p><p>It still looked more like a swimming pool than a rugby pitch by the time Welsh referee Derek Bevan got proceedings underway, but there was still a fear the game could be abandoned at any point so atrocious were the conditions.</p><p>For South Africa, that was unthinkable, especially while the game remained level on tries because, as the side with the worse disciplinary record of the two, they would be eliminated. Thankfully, the full 80 minutes was played, and the South African pack stood tall to help their side to a precious 19-15 victory.</p><p>Wales 24-15 England, Five Nations 20 April, 1995, Cardiff</p><p>The postponement of the Wales-England game in February due to bad weather was good news for the young Neath fly-half, Jonathan Davies. Wales had endured an indifferent season before calling up the youngster for his test debut when the match was eventually staged in glorious conditions at Cardiff in late April. Davies played a stormer in dropping a goal and scoring a fine individual try in a 24-15 Welsh victory.</p><p>The opening round of matches, Rugby World Cup 1991</p><p>Both the women's and men's editions of Rugby World Cup were played in the same year for the first and only time in 1991.</p><p>The women's edition was the earliest of the two, coming in April, at a time when you'd have thought the weather would play ball. However, an unseasonably cold snap with temperatures of around five degrees Celsius, and a bitterly cold wind, made for a wretched start to the tournament.</p><p>Conditions were particularly bad for the USA v the Netherlands game which resulted in a 7-0 win for the Americans. USA flanker Cathy Seabaugh was so disorientated by the cold that she joined a scrum facing in the wrong direction! Afterwards, the players poured cups of tea over their heads rather than drink them to try and get warm in lieu of properly warm water from the showers.</p><p>Fiji v New Zealand, RWC Sevens 2013 men's semi-final, Moscow</p><p>Sparks always fly when the Fiji and New Zealand men's sevens team meet, such is their pedigree in the game. But the electrical storms which coincided with the knockout stages of RWC Sevens 2013 took everyone by surprise.</p><p>The lightning was at its worst in the semi-finals and was so severe that the Fiji and New Zealand players had to leave the field with the All Blacks Sevens leading 17-0. When play eventually resumed, neither side managed to produce enough cohesive play to create a scoring opportunity. New Zealand went through to the final where they defeated England equally emphatically, 33-0.</p><p>Ireland 18-9 England, Five Nations 10 February, 1973, Dublin</p><p>With 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland at their very worst, Scotland and Wales decided not to fulfil their fixtures away to Ireland on safety grounds. Almost totally reliant on income from international matches, the Irish Rugby Football Union faced imminent bankruptcy and the Five Nations competition itself hung in the balance.</p><p>After lengthy deliberation, England opted to travel and promptly received a standing ovation when they ran out onto the pitch, a reaction that belied the political sensitivities of the time. Ireland marked the occasion with a win but the fact the game took place and prompted one of the most quotes in rugby is the real story. At the post-match function, England hooker and captain, John Pullin, said: \"We may not be much good, but at least we turn up.\"</p><p>Japan 28-21 Scotland, RWC 2019 13 October, 2019, Yokohama</p><p>People talk about the miracle of Brighton at Rugby World Cup 2015, but Japanese rugby didn't have to wait long for another one to occur at last year's home tournament.</p><p>With Typhoon Hagibis causing destruction across the country it was feared that key pool matches would fall victim to the weather and throw qualification for the knockout stages into the lap of the gods. Most crucial was Japan's game against Scotland, one which would decide the runner-up of Pool A.</p><p>Scenes of players wading through knee-high water in the tunnel to get to training the day before the game did nothing to allay fears the fixture might be postponed, but a Herculean effort from the ground staff ensured the game went ahead. It was no damp squib of a match either, the Brave Blossoms turning on the style to win 28-21 and make the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time in history.</p><p>England 3-0 Ireland 29 March, 1952, Twickenham</p><p>The death of His Majesty King George VI caused the February postponement of the England-Ireland fixture at Twickenham.</p><p>The rearranged game took place just in late March when an unseasonal snowstorm restricted travel; the attendance was barely 25,000 and playing conditions were appalling.

Third rugby match cancelled \"Unprecedented heavy rain has been seen in cities, towns and villages for which the emergency warning was issued,\" JMA forecaster Yasushi Kajiwara told reporters.\"It is important to take action that can help save your lives.\"Across large swathes of the Tokyo region and central Japan, rivers burst their banks and authorities implemented emergency discharges from dams that had reached maximum capacity.The storm wreaked havoc even before arriving in Japan, forcing the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and the cancellation of two Saturday Rugby World Cup matches.On Sunday morning, organisers said they had been forced to cancel a third fixture -- Namibia-Canada -- but gave the go-ahead to two others and were weighing up the fourth match scheduled, the crunch Japan-Scotland game.\"We were left with no option but to cancel the match on safety grounds,\" said tournament director Alan Gilpin.The cancellation is a blow for the northern town of Kamaishi, which was nearly wiped off the map by the 2011 tsunami disaster and has participated as a host city in a show of its recovery.All eyes are now on whether the do-or-die match between hosts Japan and Scotland in Yokohama will go ahead, with the Scots threatening legal action if it is prevented from playing the game and automatically eliminated. </p><p/>", "publisher": "International Business Times News", "instances": ["Oct 12, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www. ibtimes.

They organize and activate within hours, or even minutes. The obstacles they face to do their job are extreme and unpredictable.Consider for a moment trying to deliver food, water, or medical supplies to a community impacted by a severe weather event. </p><p>First you have to get the supplies into the region. Then get the supplies to relief centers, as close as possible to the impacted communities. And finally get the supplies to the individuals. Roads are often destroyed, full of debris, or flooded with water. Air and water travel are usually restricted by ongoing environmental concerns. Individuals often lack the basic means to carry or store supplies. Let's focus on one basic need: clean, safe drinking water. In many cases you cannot drive in a water tank. You have to reach each person with a viable portion of water, quickly and efficiently. Now imagine carrying several cases of bottled water or bulk rigid containers. It would require actual hero-like strength. These are the types of challenges we want to help solve. How can we use our products for social good? Could packaging be an unlikely hero? Using packaging innovation to help solve global challenges Packaging is not often the hero these days. It is getting a reputation for causing problems, versus solving them. But if we look at packaging differently and we innovate and design with purpose, packaging can be a solution. In this case, we applied an existing innovation into an area of need we had not anticipated.PacXpert\u2122 packaging technology[1]is a flexible alternative to traditional bulk rigid containers. It is lightweight and can be stored and shipped flat. It features an easy-to-use design with top and bottom handles, which enable easier, controlled pouring as well as efficient filling. Its flexible design allows it to be completely depleted of its contents, so it can be easily cleaned and reused. PacXpert\u2122 packaging technology[2]was not developed for the purpose of disaster relief or water distribution, but it was designed to provide distinct benefits. When we considered the complexities of emergency situations, these distinct benefits offered an ideal solution. In the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, residents in the Bahamas were in desperate need of safe drinking water. Using PacXpert\u2122 packaging technology, Smart Bottle was able to deliver 8,125 gallons (~30,756 liters) of water holding capacity on a single pallet. Giving a local water filtration relief group the means to efficiently provide clean water to the community. After Typhoon Hagibis devastated Japan, the employees of Dow Japan took action donating 1,800 flexible containers enabled by PacXpert\u2122 packaging technology and $25,000 in support of local relief group, A-PAD Japan. This enabled A-PAD Japan to quickly deliver the containers to Soma-city, Fukushima prefecture and Marumori-city, Miyagi prefecture. A-PAD has been using this flexible and efficient packaging option to assist with emergency situations since 2017. Plastics SA in South Africa has used PacXpert\u2122 packaging technology in multiple relief situations. It was used to deliver drinking water to Mozambique after a series of devastating storms in 2019. Plastics SA is also using the technology to transport water into areas of Cape Town impacted by drought, such as Khayalitsha, the largest informal settlement of Cape Town Metropole, where shacks were destroyed during a fire in the beginning of 2019. Supporting disaster relief, sustainably What we don't want to do it solve one problem, while creating another. This is another reason why PacXpert\u2122 packaging technology was an ideal response. It's lightweight and flat design allow a larger number of units to be transported more efficiently - meaning less emissions from vehicles. The fact that it can be completely depleted means every drop of product - in this case, water - can be used. This also allows the package to be easily cleaned and ready for use again. This is not a single-use solution. An unexpected reuse of PacXpert\u2122 packaging technology Since 2017, PacXpert\u2122 packaging technology has been used to provide clean drinking water for volunteers duringProject Butterfly[3]cleanup events in Africa. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Africa in 2020, rural communities were looking for ways to provide basic hygiene needs. The PacXpert\u2122 containers that had been previously used for water, were transformed and reused for hand washing stations. I am encouraged by the impact a single innovation can have. Imagine how we could use packaging for good. When we focus on designing packaging with purpose, it can help solve challenges. Learn more aboutPacXpert\u2122 packaging technology[4].

Japan is certainly not shielded from it, although the bull/ bear debate on Japan has been going on since well before the coronavirus was reported. A weaker-than-expected GDP reading for the fourth quarter had many investors leaning bearish on the Japanese market, but it seems the tide is starting to turn. </p><p>So is now the time for the bulls or the bears to come out in Japan?

Q4 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2]Bulls / bears on Japan: coronavirus impactsThe biggest factor in the bulls/ bears debate on Japan right now is the coronavirus[3]. In a report dated Feb. 17, Nomura analyst Takashi Miwa set out three scenarios for the impact the outbreak will have on nations around the world, including Japan. His base case assumes that major Chinese cities remain locked down until the end of February. In this scenario, he estimates that Japan's annual real GDP will shrink 0.5%. That's 0.7 percentage points below his previous forecast and includes both the coronavirus impact and the weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP number. His base case assumes a decline of 42 percentage points in inbound tourist arrivals and tourist spending. It also assumes a drop of 10 percentage points in exports to China during the first quarter. He assumes a similar decline in corporate capital expenditures, although not quite as much as exports. He also predicts a \"slightly negative impact\" on domestic private consumption. This scenario assumes a decline of 1 percentage point in overall real GDP for the first quarter. It also assumes a rebound in the second and third quarters, although not enough to recover the demand that was lost in the first quarter. Miwa doesn't expect Japan's central bank to offer any kind of policy response in his base case. He notes that the Bank of Japan is \"running low on additional policy instruments\" to address the GDP slowdown. Additionally, the response of the yen versus the U.S. dollar to the coronavirus news has not been significant, so there is some flexibility for the central bank to address appreciation in the yen.Behind the real GDP decline in Q4Earlier this week, it was reported that Japan's GDP plunged 1.6% quarter over quarter, which was worse than the Bloomberg consensus of a 1% decline. Since growth in the third quarter was revised down from 0.4% to 0.1% quarter over quarter, output declined 0.4% year over year in the fourth quarter. Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant said in a report dated Feb. 17 that private consumption plunged 2.9% quarter over quarter. The government froze the tax rate on food at 8%, which did help. Spending on services was better, but spending on durable goods plunged 12.8% quarter over quarter. He expects consumer spending to bounce back in the first quarter unless consumer confidence takes a significant hit from the coronavirus outbreak. In a separate report, Thieliant and fellow Capital Economics economist Tom Learmouth said the two main causes of the sharp decline in manufacturing output for the fourth quarter were the sales tax increase in October and Typhoon Hagibis. They pointed out that both Japan and Germany saw their industrial production fall in step with each other. This is significant as the two nations both depend heavily on the auto industry for their manufacturing output. Since both nations were affected, they argue that external factors contributed to the decline in manufacturing output.Bulls and bears on Japan: bondsAccording to Thieliant and Learmouth, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds have been hovering close to the midpoint of the Bank of Japan's \"around zero\" target this year. Gold priced and Japanese government bond yields have diverged in recent months. However, while demand for gold has increased due to the coronavirus outbreak, safe-haven demand for Japanese bonds has been lower. The spread between U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds has declined in the last month. However, the yen has not strengthened against the U.S. dollar. The Capital Economics team also noted that equity markets have been holding up fairly well despite the coronavirus outbreak.Bulls and bears on Japan: equitiesThe Nikkei has underperformed U.S. equities in the last two months despite the fact that the yen hasn't strengthened against the dollar. Thieliant and Learmouth say that was because Japanese corporate earnings have been weak. However, they believe Japanese equities started the year with attractive valuations compared to U.S. equities. They predict that the Nikkei 225 will rise to 26,000 by the end of 2021. Investors are starting to notice the attractive valuations in Japanese equities[4]. Nomura analyst Naka Matsuzawa said weekly flow data revealed that foreign investors were \"major net buyers\" of Japanese equities the week of Feb. 3. They bought 791.7 billion worth of Japanese equities in what was the first week of net buying in six weeks. Foreign investors essentially replaced some of the 1.7 trillion worth of Japanese equities they had sold in the five weeks before. Most of the buying was futures, and he believes it was due to the unwinding of excessive hedging.

By that time, a Great Britain women's team had already faced France on four occasions, beginning on 19 April, 1986 in Richmond, when the French won 14-8.</p><p>Where is it played?</p><p>Parc des Princes was the venue for the first men's match in 1906 and from 1974 until 1996, France's home matches were all held at the stadium. Since 1998, the Stade de France built for the FIFA World Cup that year has hosted Les Bleus' home matches. Between 1908-72 another stadium in Paris, Stade Colombes, hosted France's men. Various club grounds have played host to matches between France and England's women's teams. In 2020, 14,000 spectators watched England beat their rivals 19-13 at Stade du Hameau in Pau in February, while Stade des Alpes in Grenoble hosted the teams nine months later.</p><p>France's first two visits to England were hosted at Richmond's Athletic Ground and Welford Road in Leicester respectively.

His 18 tests against France came between 1991-2003 and comprised 12 wins and six defeats. However, four of Leonard's appearances came as a replacement meaning his former team-mate Rory Underwood holds the English record for number of starts.

And for good reason. Damage from climate-related disasters was in the billions of dollars in 2019 alone. California wildfires caused $25 billion in property damage, while Typhoon Hagibis in Japan cost an estimated $15 billion. </p><p>Other extreme weather events, including rampant brush fires in Australia, widespread droughts in East Africa and severe flooding in South Asia, have had devastating consequences.Insurers seeking to underwrite weather-related risks face growing challenges. While the availability of insurance can help mitigate some of the impacts of climatic shifts, insurers stand to lose billions of dollars from catastrophic weather events. As a result, some insurers have had to significantly increase premiums in particularly risk-prone areas, while others have found it difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to economically write or renew coverage.Already, some state regulators have taken steps to limit insurers' ability to decline these types of risks. For example, in response to the Sandalwood and Hillside wildfires, the California Insurance Commissioner issued a mandatory, one-year moratorium prohibiting insurance companies from declining to renew policies issued to residents in wildfire disaster areas. Under the prior regulation, carriers were prohibited from terminating policies for homeowners who sustained a total loss in a wildfire; the moratorium expanded that rule to include homeowners living adjacent to wildfire emergency areas who had not been directly impacted by the fires.The stated purpose of the moratorium was to allow time for the state and insurance carriers to work on lasting solutions that would aid both in reducing wildfire risk and stabilizing the insurance market. The decision came amid growing evidence that homeowners insurance had become increasingly difficult for certain Californians to obtain from traditional carriers. By necessity, those carriers that did offer insurance to homeowners living in wildfire areas had to charge higher premiums. The moratorium, then, was designed to provide homeowners with affordable insurance options until the devastation caused by wildfires subsides.California was the first state to impose such requirements. But regulators in other at-risk states may follow suit. That could force insurers to take on significant additional risks arising out of climate-related events, such as flood and drought. To address these concerns, traditional carriers and start-ups have begun to develop new technologies (InsurTech) that are tailored to provide innovative solutions to the unique risks associated with climate change.One such start-up is Jupiter Intelligence (Jupiter). Founded in 2017, Jupiter provides asset-level, data-driven risk analyses designed to predict the likelihood of extreme weather events. The platform uses a program that continuously refreshes satellite and sensor data. Jupiter integrates probabilistic climate prediction with comprehensive risk analyses to project the likelihood of and risks associated with flood, fire, heat, drought, cold, wind and hail events.Their customers include insurers and risk managers, who utilize Jupiter's services to assess risks associated with extreme weather, sea-level rise, storm intensification, and increasing temperatures over time. Some major carriers, like QBE, one of the world's largest property and casualty insurers, have begun working with Jupiter to assess climate risk. According to David McMillan, Group Chief Operations Officer at QBE, 'Jupiter and QBE are collaborating to improve underwriting and pricing processes and to offer climate risk adaptation expertise to our customers.'Another company providing similar services is Kin Insurance (Kin). Kin's goal is to update traditional underwriting models in order to provide customized coverage for homeowners living in coastal areas. Founded in 2016, Kin began as a tech-driven home insurance provider in Florida, offering products tailored to the needs of customers in a region known for severe weather events. Kin functions by leveraging thousands of publicly-available data points to recommend appropriate coverage to homeowners.In August 2019, Kin announced that it had raised $47 million in funding to launch Kin Insurance Network. It has used this funding to become a licensed homeowners insurance carrier in Florida.Like Kin, NYC-based WorldCover was created in response to climate-related disasters. It works to provide drought insurance to farmers in Africa. When first launched, WorldCover was available only in Ghana and covered only one crop: maize. Since then, the company has expanded to multiple markets in East and West Africa, covering four categories of crops: cereals, legumes, root vegetables and perennials. WorldCover uses a combination of satellite imagery and on-the-ground sensors to understand local weather patterns in order to create insurance options for farmers facing some of the world's worst droughts. The company uses its satellites to monitor rainfall patterns and trigger payouts immediately.Companies outside of the United States also specialize in climate risks. MeteoProtect is a French-based global insurance and reinsurance broker dedicated exclusively to weather risk management. MeteoProtect issues parametric policies, which pay out when a pre-agreed event \u2014 such as a hurricane or tornado of a specific intensity \u2014 occurs.The company uses climatology or meteorology to measure the 'climate resilience' of businesses with a solution it calls 'Weather Neutral.' Using this technology, MeteoProtect is able to offer insurers real-time exposure assessment and contract pricing. MeteoProtect uses its data to integrate climate risks into mainstream insurance portfolios, which allows insurers to balance their overall exposure to climate variability and transfer undesired risks through weather derivatives. In April 2020, Cooper Gay France, the European brokerage and wholesale managing general agency, acquired MeteoProtect's brand and technology.Traditional carriers are also investing in new technologies to address climate-related risks. Allianz, an industry leader, offers customized policies to assist customers in managing weather extremes such as sea level rise, rainfall, temperature fluctuation and wind surges. Swiss Re recently launched FLOW, an index-based product designed to protect companies in Europe from the financial impact of high or low river water levels. Unlike traditional insurance coverages, which typically require loss investigations, FLOW provides fixed pay-out amounts based on a defined index. For example, when water flows drop below an agreed-upon level, a payment is automatically triggered.While the rise of InsurTech is necessary and beneficial, it is also likely to have regulatory implications. For example, anti-rebating laws generally prohibit insurers from offering policyholders anything of value, apart from insurance. These laws present challenges for InsurTech companies that seek to market telematics devices that monitor a user's personal data. In response, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has moved to amend its Model Unfair Trade Practices Act, with the goal of rewriting anti-rebating prohibitions.Some InsurTech products also offer virtual agent services. This may present licensing issues, as many states require professionals who sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance to obtain an insurance producer's license specific to that state. The use of virtual agents also raises potential claims handling and trade practices act considerations.That said, efforts are underway to free InsurTech's advancement from some of the restrictions typically applied to insurance industry innovations. For example, in March 2019 the Kentucky legislature enacted House Bill 386, which established the first InsurTech 'sandbox' in the country. The law establishes a two-part regulatory safe harbor, or sandbox, that permits insurers to submit technologies for participation in an initial beta test and, if approved, an extended period of relief from regulation. Administered by the Kentucky Department of Insurance, the sandbox is intended to provide innovators with a safe space to test and launch insurance-related technologies not contemplated by the Insurance Code.While Kentucky's approach suggests that states can see the benefits of InsurTech to insurers and policyholders, traditional carriers and start-up companies must remain aware of existing regulations and other bureaucratic impediments to the introduction of new technologies. Nevertheless, investment, development and implementation of InsurTech products will be crucial as the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters looks to be on the rise. </p><p/>", "publisher": "JD Supra", "instances": ["And for good reason.

Our diluted book value per share at the end of the quarter was $16.42. The combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 123.0%, which included $37.2\u00a0million, or 20.4 percentage points on the combined ratio related to prior year reserve development where we increased certain casualty reserves in response to our accumulated loss experience and the broader industry trends of social inflation. Our fourth quarter results also included $18.6\u00a0million attributable to catastrophe losses and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, for a total impact of 10.2 percentage points on the combined ratio,\" commented Dan Malloy, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our previously announced merger with Sirius Group is expected to close on February 26 and we are looking forward to welcoming our new colleagues.\"</p><p>Sid Sankaran, Chairman of the Company commented, \"While we are not satisfied with the underwriting results in 2020, with the exceptional talent, global footprint and robust balance sheet of the combined company, we will have a strong base for building an innovative, disciplined and sustainable business. We are aiming to enhance our existing relationships and improve the economics of our key lines of business, while looking at ways that we can grow intelligently and leverage technology to improve how we manage risk, use data and develop new strategic opportunities.\"</p><p>Additional Information on Financial Results</p><p>The following table shows certain key financial metrics for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written</p><p>Gross premiums written increased by $31.4 million, or 23.4%, to $165.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 from $134.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to $45.5 million of new casualty premium written in the period, including $19.0 million from Arcadian.</p><p>Gross premiums written decreased by $43.8 million, or 6.9%, to $588.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from $631.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in gross premiums written was primarily due to certain contracts that we did not renew, including certain contracts which no longer fit our underwriting criteria as a result of our shift in underwriting strategy. This decrease was partially offset by new contracts bound in the current year.</p><p>Net underwriting results</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2020, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $7.0\u00a0million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 3.8 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Delta and Hurricane Zeta, compared to $16.3\u00a0million in the three months ended December 31, 2019, or 8.2 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $36.6\u00a0million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 6.0 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to Hurricane Laura and other 2020 catastrophes, compared to $29.0\u00a0million in the year ended December 31, 2019, or 4.1 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Dorian, Typhoon Faxai and Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak is causing unprecedented social disruption, global economic volatility, reduced liquidity of capital markets and intervention by various governments around the world.\u00a0 For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net losses of $11.6 million and $46.7 million, respectively, net of additional premiums, or 6.4 and 7.6 percentage points, respectively, on the combined ratio, relating to COVID-19. These losses were driven primarily by event cancellation, property business interruption, and certain casualty and multi-line quota share contracts.</p><p>The economic impact of the ongoing pandemic will continue to create uncertainty around the ultimate scope of claims and potential for additional insurance losses. Our estimate is based on currently available information provided by cedents. These estimates include losses only related to our estimate of claims incurred as of December 31, 2020.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an increase in net underwriting loss of $37.2 million and $34.6 million, respectively, related to net adverse development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs. The adverse underwriting loss development is a result of accumulated loss experience and cedent reserving increases, indicating that underlying casualty loss trends are higher than initial pricing and reserving, consistent with the industry impact of social inflation. In addition, the current elevated level of uncertainty makes historical data less applicable for future projections, and has contributed to an increase in the estimate of ultimate losses on certain accounts.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net $1.1\u00a0million and $5.4\u00a0million improvement in the net underwriting results, respectively, related to net favorable development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs.</p><p>Investments</p><p>The following is a summary of our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment return for our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment income for our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment return by investment strategy on total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the net investment results were primarily attributable to long event/fundamental equities. Activist positions also performed strongly, helping offset losses earlier in the year in this category. The credit strategy contributed gains from both the corporate credit and structured credit portfolios. In the other strategy, gains were driven by private investments.</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net investment results were primarily attributable to long event/fundamental equities, in particular a renewed focus on growth and technology positions.

Basic book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders by the number of common shares outstanding, excluding the total number of unvested restricted shares, at period end. Diluted book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, we assume that proceeds received from in-the-money options and/or warrants exercised are used to repurchase common shares in the market. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Change in basic book value per share is calculated by taking the difference in basic book value per share for the periods presented divided by the beginning of period book value per share. Change in diluted book value per share is calculated by taking the difference in diluted book value per share for the periods presented divided by the beginning of period diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows our management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings.\u00a0 In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.</p><p>Return on Beginning Shareholders' Equity Attributable to Third Point Re Common Shareholders</p><p>Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is calculated by dividing net income available to Third Point Re common shareholders by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders. We believe that return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is an important measure because it assists our management and investors in evaluating the Company's profitability.</p><p>Key Performance Indicator</p><p>Net Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC</p><p>Net investment return represents the return on our net investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on net investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our net investment assets managed by Third Point LLC.\u00a0The net investment return reflects the combined results of our investments in TP Fund, collateral assets and certain other investment assets managed by Third Point LLC. Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, our investment manager.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY88258&amp;sd=2021-02-23\"/> View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-point-re-announces-fourth-quarter-2020-earnings-results-301233956.html</p><p>SOURCE Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY88258&amp;Transmission_Id=202102231610PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY88258&amp;DateId=20210223\"/></p>", "publisher": "PR Newswire", "instances": ["8 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Delta and Hurricane Zeta, compared to $16. 3\u00a0million in the three months ended December 31, 2019, or 8.

Experts say climate fiction, or cli-fi, will prove central in the fight against climate change. \"I'm interested in how you can use this sort of long-form storytelling narrative approach to communicate complex ideas,\" said James Jones, Associate Professor of Earth System Science at Stanford University, \"because climate change is complicated ... and there are lots of cascading consequences.\" Jones is also a Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment, and an avid cli-fi reader himself. Neuroscience studies of storytelling have shown that people tend to have a stronger response when information is presented in a narrative format, in part because a powerful story fully engages the reader or viewer through investment in the narrative and characters. For example, when public service announcements (PSAs) are engaging, oxytocin and a hormone related to attentiveness are released in the brain, and donations to relevant charities become 261 percent more likely, according to a study conducted by neurobiologist Paul Zak in 2015. Another benefit of achieving successful engagement is the activation of the body's stress pathways, which can alter how audiences perceive the threat of climate change.</p><p>Hodaka watches as Hina prays the rain away on the day they meet. Courtesy of GKids press kit.</p><p>Human beliefs about the world are determined by what we see on a daily basis. If a city experiences a cold winter and a warm summer, for example, its citizens will have less anxiety about climate change because they're not seeing clear evidence of it in their everyday lives. Known as the positivity bias, this psychological effect is considered a major barrier to raising climate change awareness.</p><p>But stress has the power to override it.</p><p>Cli-fi with a strong narrative, relatable characters and emotional plot lines can draw audiences in and activate stress pathways, erasing the positivity bias and making it possible for them to experience a shift in their thinking about climate change.</p><p>Another aspect of successful cli-fi is telling a relatable story where the characters are navigating everyday tasks and challenges, like finding a job and building interpersonal relationships. When elements of a changing climate are present, but secondary to these day-to-day concerns, audiences can first connect to the characters' struggles. These initial connection points pave the way for the reader or viewer to start digesting a story's deeper climate change themes - and see parallels to their own lives in the process.</p><p>The never-ending downpour depicted in \"Weathering with You\" seems fantastical at first. But Hina and Hodaka's fighting to keep moving forward and helping each other along the way is such a human story that it becomes possible to connect with them and see parallels between their reality and ours. The rain that seemed purely fictional becomes a metaphor for unusual weather patterns. The absence of Japanese wildlife that usually thrives during the summer conjures thoughts of changing ecosystems. And the slow but constant flooding of Tokyo's streets mirrors the reality of rising sea levels.</p><p>But there are positive parallels, too - Hina and Hodaka's continued search for solutions reminds us that, even when something feels wildly outside of human control, like climate change, the situation is not completely hopeless. A cli-fi like \"Weathering with You\" is special not only because it raises awareness of environmental issues, but also because it reminds us that there is an active role we can play in fighting for a better future.</p><p>Contact Kaylee Beam at kbeam97 'at' stanford.edu.</p><p>.css-10w0hkr{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-10w0hkr{width:650px;}}Kaylee Beam.css-qmqbsq{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-qmqbsq{width:600px;}}</p>", "publisher": "University Wire", "instances": ["Scorching summers and strong typhoons have become the norm in Japan in recent years.

It documents impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security and land and marine ecosystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019 includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, leading international experts, scientific institutions and United Nations agencies. The flagship report provides authoritative information for policy makers on the need for Climate Action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report confirms information in a provisional statement issued at the UN Climate Change Conference in December that 2019 was the second warmest year in the instrumental record. 2015-2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850.</p><p>2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1C above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Nino event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend.</p><p>\"We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for,\" said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a foreword.</p><p>\"This report outlines the latest science and illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate action. It brings together data from across the fields of climate science and lists the potential future impacts of climate change - from health and economic consequences to decreased food security and increased displacement,\" he said.</p><p>The report was launched at a press conference given by the UN Secretary-General and WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at UN headquarters on 10 March.</p><p>\"Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time,\" said WMO Secretary-General Taalas.</p><p>\"We just had the warmest January on record. Winter was unseasonably mild in many parts of the northern hemisphere. Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in CO2 emissions. Reported record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier which will have repercussions for sea level rise,\" said Mr Taalas.</p><p>\"Temperature is one indicator of ongoing climate change. Changes in the global distribution of rainfall have had a major impact on several countries. Sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, largely due to the thermal expansion of sea water as well as melting of the largest glaciers, like in Greenland and Antarctica. This is exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas,\" said Mr Taalas.</p><p>OCEANS</p><p>Marine heatwaves: More than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. In 2019, ocean heat content down to a depth of 2 kilometres exceeded the previous record highs set in 2018.</p><p>Ocean warming has widespread impacts on the climate system and contributes more than 30% of sea level rise through thermal expansion of sea water. It is altering ocean currents and indirectly altering storm tracks and melting floating ice shelves. Together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation, ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems. In 2019, the ocean experienced on average nearly 2 months of unusually warm temperatures. At least 84% of the ocean experienced at least one marine heatwave.</p><p>Ocean Acidification: In the decade 2009-2018, the ocean absorbed around 23% of annual CO2 emissions, cushioning the impacts of climate change but increasing ocean acidity. The change of pH reduces the ability of marine organisms such as mussels, crustacean and corals to calcify, affecting marine life, growth and reproduction.</p><p>Ocean Deoxygenation: both observations and models indicate that oxygen is declining in the open and coastal oceans, including estuaries and semi-enclosed seas. Since the middle of the last century, there has been an estimated 1%-2% decrease (77 billion-145 billion tons) in the global ocean oxygen inventory.</p><p>Marine Ecosystems: Deoxygenation alongside ocean warming and acidification is now seen as a major threat to ocean ecosystems and the wellbeing of people that depend on them. Coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%-30% of former cover at 1.5C warming, and to less than 1% at 2C warming.</p><p>Sea level has risen throughout the satellite altimetery record (since 1993), but the rate has increased over that time, mainly due to melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on the record.</p><p>Ice: The continued long-term decline of Arctic sea ice was confirmed in 2019. The September monthly average extent (usually the lowest of the year) was the third lowest on record with the daily minimum extent tied for second lowest.</p><p>Until 2016, Antarctic sea ice extent had shown a small long-term increase. In late 2016 this was interrupted by a sudden drop in extent to extreme low values. Since then, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels.</p><p>The Greenland ice sheet has recorded nine of the 10 lowest surface mass balance years in the last 13 years. And 2019 was the 7th lowest on record. In terms of total mass balance. Greenland lost about 260 Gt of ice per year over the period 2002-2016, with a maximum of 458 Gt in 2011/12. The loss in 2019 was 329 Gt, well above the average.</p><p>Glaciers: Preliminary results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate that 2018/19 was the 32nd consecutive year of negative mass balance for selected reference glaciers. Eight out of the ten most negative mass balance years were recorded since 2010.</p><p>Climate-related Impacts</p><p>The report devotes an extensive section to weather and climate impacts on human health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life. This is based on input from a wide variety of United Nations partners. (See in Editor's note for full list)</p><p>High impact events</p><p>Tropical cyclones: Tropical cyclone activity globally in 2019 was above average. The Northern Hemisphere had 72 tropical cyclones. The 2018-19 Southern Hemisphere season was also above average, with 27 cyclones. Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March as one of the strongest known on the east coast of Africa, resulting in many casualties and widespread devastation. Idai contributed to the complete destruction of close to 780 000 ha of crops in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, further undermining a precarious food security situation in the region. The cyclone also resulted in at least 50 905 displaced persons in Zimbabwe, 53 237 in southern Malawi and 77 019 in Mozambique. One of the year's most intense tropical cyclones was Dorian, which made landfall with category 5 intensity in the Bahamas.

Nevertheless, pricing gaps persist, as the reinsurance market capacity remains abundant and emerging risks such as climate change and social inflation are still to be fully incorporated into reinsurance prices.</p><p>In this context, SCOR has built on its longstanding client relationships to proactively manage the pricing cycle, focusing on business compliant with its profitability targets and risk appetite.</p><p>Reinsurance treaties renewal book at January 1, 20201):</p><p>Gross Premiums renewed Evolution vs. January 2019 Notable drivers (in EUR millions) P&amp;C Lines2) 2,277 -6.4% United States, China Global Lines3) 881 0.0% n.a.

Such an outcome further demonstrates the relevance of SCOR's fully equipped 360\u00b0 risk-taking platform, as outlined in the \"Quantum Leap\" strategic plan.Looking forward to the April, June &amp; July renewals, the market is expected to stay firm, with the possibility of further hardening as loss affected contracts come up for renewal. SCOR will rebuild the sustained profitability of its Japanese portfolio based on its long-standing client relationships. Given its modest US casualty portfolio, SCOR is well positioned to benefit from further market changes arising from upcoming US renewals.2019 Premium and natural catastrophe updateFor the full year 2019, SCOR Global P&amp;C experienced a strong gross written premiums growth, of 15.8% at constant exchange rates, to EUR 7.1bn. This was driven both by Reinsurance (+16.2%) and Specialty Insurance (+14.4%). The growth arises from the strong 2019 successive renewals, and also benefits from the very robust H2 2018 renewals particularly in the US.SCOR estimates the cost of natural catastrophes in Q4 2019 at EUR 343 million after retrocession and before tax.The fourth quarter of 2019 has registered a high severity of natural catastrophe events worldwide, in particular coming from typhoons in Japan. SCOR estimates the cost of Japanese typhoon Hagibis at EUR 227 million after retrocession and before tax based upon cedants' information and assuming an insured market loss in the region of USD 8 billion. Our efficient retro program would allow SCOR to materially dampen the increase in the loss, should Hagibis deviate beyond our current estimate of market loss assumption.Following an upward market loss revision of Japanese typhoon Faxai and the impact of other events during the fourth quarter, SCOR estimates the cost of Q4 2019 QTD natural catastrophes at EUR 343 million after retrocession and before tax, and at EUR 665 million after retrocession and before tax for the full year. While remaining within SCOR's risk appetite and thanks to its efficient capital shield policy, SCOR Global P&amp;C expects to record an actual net combined ratio below 100% for full year 2019, including natural catastrophe costs. In 2019, SCOR continues to demonstrate its shock-absorbing capacity and pursues the execution of its strategic plan \"Quantum Leap\" with a very strong solvency position and an unchanged dividend policy.Jean-Paul Conoscente, CEO of SCOR Global P&amp;C, comments: \"As the reinsurance market did not fully react to loss perspectives as we had initially anticipated, SCOR maintains a disciplined underwriting approach as evidenced during the January 2020 renewals. Despite plentiful reinsurance capacity, persistently low interest rates and upward expected losses, SCOR significantly improves its P&amp;C profitability, while accompanying the growth of its key reinsurance clients. Thanks to its Specialty Insurance arm, SCOR leverages further the hardening witnessed in commercial lines, expected to continue throughout the year. Given that the January 2020 renewals are focused on EMEA with benign loss experience, we expect more pronounced favorable market conditions through the spring/summer 2020 renewals and maintain our \"Quantum Leap\" assumptions for the duration of the plan.\"** *Contact detailsMediaAnette Rey+33 (0)1 58 44 82 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:82arey@scor.comInvestor\">82arey@scor.comInvestor</email> RelationsIan Kelly+44 (0)203 207 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:8561ikelly@scor.com\">8561ikelly@scor.com</email><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scor.comLinkedIn:\">www.scor.comLinkedIn:</url> SCOR | Twitter: @SCOR_SEGeneralNumbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to the totals in the tables and text.

Under the treasury stock method, the Company computes the number of new shares that can potentially be created by unexercised in-the-money warrants and options. The Company then assumes that the proceeds received from the exercise of in-the-money warrant and/or options are used to repurchase outstanding common shares in the market. The number of additional shares that are added back to the basic book value per share denominator is equal to the difference between (i) the number of new shares potentially created by unexercised in-the-money warrants and options and (ii) the number of shares that could be repurchased in the market. The previous method used did not contemplate repurchasing shares in the market, which the Company believes overstated the impact of dilution. This change had no impact on basic book value per share. The following table shows the revised DBVPS compared to the DBVPS as previously presented:</p><p>Basic book value per share and diluted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures and there are no comparable GAAP measures. Basic book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders by the number of common shares outstanding, excluding the total number of unvested restricted shares, at period end. Diluted book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, we assume that proceeds received from in-the-money options and/or warrants exercised are used to repurchase common shares in the market. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Change in basic book value per share is calculated by taking the difference in basic book value per share for the periods presented divided by the beginning of period book value per share. Change in diluted book value per share is calculated by taking the difference in diluted book value per share for the periods presented divided by the beginning of period diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows our management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings.\u00a0 In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.</p><p>Return on Beginning Shareholders' Equity Attributable to Third Point Re Common Shareholders</p><p>Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to Third Point Re common shareholders by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders. We believe that return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is an important measure because it assists our management and investors in evaluating the Company's profitability. When we repurchase our common shares, we also adjust the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders for the impact of the shares repurchased on a weighted average basis. For a period where there was a loss, this adjustment decreased the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity and for a period where there was a gain, this adjustment increased the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity.</p><p>Key Performance Indicator</p><p>Net Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC</p><p>Net investment return represents the return on our net investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on net investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our net investment assets managed by Third Point LLC.\u00a0Effective August 31, 2018, we transitioned from our separately managed account structure to investing in TP Fund.\u00a0In addition, collateral assets and certain other investment assets, including fixed income securities, are managed by Third Point LLC. The net investment return reflects the combined results of investments managed on behalf of Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA prior to the transition date of August 31, 2018 and the investments in TP Fund, collateral assets and certain other investment assets subsequent to the date of transition. Prior to the transition date of August 31, 2018, the stated return was net of noncontrolling interests and net of withholding taxes, which were presented as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, TP Fund's investment manager.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY32517&amp;sd=2020-02-27\"/> View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-point-re-announces-fourth-quarter-2019-earnings-results-301012960.html</p><p>SOURCE Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY32517&amp;Transmission_Id=202002271610PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY32517&amp;DateId=20200227\"/></p>", "publisher": "PR Newswire", "instances": ["Net underwriting resultsFor the three months ended December\u00a031, 2019, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $16. 3 million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 8. 5 million in the three months ended December\u00a031, 2018, or 8. 8 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to the California wildfires and other catastrophe events.", "For the year ended December\u00a031, 2019, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $29. 0 million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 4. 5 million in the year ended December\u00a031, 2018, or 3. 0 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to the California wildfires and other 2018 catastrophe events."]}, {"relevance_score": 14, "title": "Rugby World Cup chaos as England-France and New Zealand-Italy games canceled due to Super Typhoon Hagibis", "published": "2019-10-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two Rugby World Cup matches scheduled for Saturday have been canceled on safety grounds as Super Typhoon Hagibis approaches Japan, tournament organizers announced at a press conference on Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Pool B match between New Zealand and Italy in the city of Toyota, and the Pool C match between England and France in Tokyo, are so far the only games affected.

Tokyo and nearby Yokohama are at the center of the storm. </p><p>Weekend games between New Zealand and Italy as well as France and England had already been canceled Thursday, with Saturday's Formula One qualifying at the Japanese Grand Prix also canceled. </p><p>If Japan and Scotland are not able to play, the game will be declared a 0-0 draw with both teams receiving two points. Ireland would then play South Africa in the next round as group winners with Japan taking on New Zealand.</p><p>A resounding win</p><p>Not that Ireland were concerned with that for the 80 minutes against Samoa in Fukuoka, western Japan, some 1,100 kilometers away from Tokyo. Having already lost once in this tournament -- a 19-12 defeat to Japan that few saw coming -- coach Joe Schmidt's team would have been eager to lay down a marker ahead of the knockout phase. </p><p>The first score came after just three minutes when captain and hooker Rory Best finished from the back of a driving maul.</p><p>Winger Jacob Stockdale received the Samoan restart and charged up the field where he was clattered by Seilala Lam. The referee deemed the challenge illegal and replays justified the brandished yellow card for a high shoulder.</p><p>The Irish forwards enjoyed the man advantage and dictated the early exchanges. It was another front-rower who dotted down when Tadhg Furlong scored his second try of the competition on 10 minutes. The burly prop gave a show-and-go before finishing from eight meters out.</p><p>The game threatened to become a rout when Sexton -- who scored 18 points on the night -- was on the receiving end of a delightful inside ball from his fullback Jordan Larmour and had an easy run to the line. Sexton converted and the score read 21-0 after 21 minutes.</p><p>That trio of tries finally galvanized the Pacific Islanders who won a line out in Irish territory and worked through several phases. Captain Jack Lam burrowed and retrieved the ball two meters out and was too strong for his opposing No. 8 CJ Stander to score.</p><p>That proved to be a momentum shift and the pendulum swung even further towards the men in blue when Ireland's inside center Bundee Aki was shown a straight red for a dangerous tackle on fly-half Ulupano Seuteni. There appeared no malice in the act, but referees are under strict instruction to harshly punish errant shoulders that make contact with the head or face. </p><p>Ireland were forced to consolidate with a man down but grew back in the game as the halftime whistle approached. The bonus point for four tries scored was made safe just before the interval when Sexton had his second after a well worked move from a scrum. He missed the extra points from the conversion as he led his team into the break 26-5 ahead.</p><p>Sterner tests await</p><p>Though depleted in the backs, the Irish forwards continued to dominate and they folded the Samoan pack from a scrum on 48 minutes. The resulting penalty was quickly taken and neat interplay saw Larmour achieve a deserving five-pointer. Sexton slotted the extras in his last act of the match. </p><p>Two more Irish tries -- from Stander and replacement Andrew Conway -- meant the 2018 Six Nations champions registered their highest score in Japan.</p><p>Ireland will face tougher opposition in the next round as it seeks to reach the semifinals of a World Cup for the first time in its history. New Zealand's All Blacks or South Africa's Springboks await.

The patented AccuWeather MinuteCast\u00ae forecast, for example, gives users precipitation forecasts up to two hours ahead with precise start and stop times for every location. And in addition to hour-by-hour forecasts, AccuWeather offers forecasts that extend farther into the future than any other source, all the way up to 90-day forecasts that are highly popular with users who like to plan ahead.</p><p>These added benefits, explained Myers, coupled with AccuWeather's carefully crafted communication and emphasis on how forecasts impact peoples' lives and activities, make AccuWeather's forecasts uniquely valuable.</p><p>AccuWeather's proven Superior Accuracy is achieved by exclusive patented technology, the largest collection of global forecast models and data, leading-edge predictive AI and machine learning, and the best IP and procedures developed and refined over the company's 57-year history, combined with the most talented and experienced group of meteorological forecasters anywhere.

AccuWeather works with more than half of the Fortune 500 companies and thousands of other businesses and government agencies globally to keep customers and employees safe, minimize losses and liability, save costs, improve efficiency and significantly outperform their competitors with uniquely valuable insights.</p><p>In business to help keep people safe, AccuWeather is dedicated to innovation and has developed many scientific breakthroughs and life-saving innovations, such as its exclusive AccuWeather RealImpact(TM) Scale for Hurricanes, a six-point scale, including a rating of less than one, to better communicate the impacts of hurricanes and tropical storms. Unlike the widely used Saffir-Simpson scale, which only uses wind speed, the RealImpact Scale incorporates a variety of factors to communicate the threat of a hurricane, such as flooding rain, storm surge and total damage and economic loss in addition to wind speed.</p><p>Some recent examples of AccuWeather's dedication to forecasting and communicating with Superior Accuracy include:</p><p>August/September 2019- Days in advance, AccuWeather correctly predicted Hurricane Dorian would be a 5 on the AccuWeather RealImpact Scale for Hurricanes when it devastated the northern Bahamas and a 2 across the southeastern United States. AccuWeather's forecasting accuracy led to a week's advance notice of the threat that wreaked havoc on the Bahamas, warning of flooding, coastal inundation, building, structural and tree damage. The company received many expressions of gratitude from emergency planners and the public for the early warnings.</p><p>October 2019- AccuWeather correctly predicted the landfall location of Super Typhoon Hagibis, which devastated the Kanto region of Japan, many days in advance, with a 6-day track error of 60 miles and a 4-day forecast that was nearly identical to the actual landfall location. Important impacts were communicated by AccuWeather including expected flash flooding, damaging winds, mudslides and travel disruptions. AccuWeather also cautioned about possible evacuations. In Tokyo, AccuWeather predicted wind gusts would be 80-100 mph and 6-12 inches of rain. Actual observations were 93 mph wind gusts and 9 inches of rain.</p><p>February 2019-Well in advance of a major snow and ice storm, AccuWeather's long-range forecasting and meteorology team warned of a northeast storm's impact as early as one week prior to the event. The company's impact-driven forecasts accurately conveyed the significant winter weather and its effect on people and businesses, including widespread power outages, slow and slippery travel conditions and a period of heavy snow and substantial buildup of ice. While there was major disruption to much of the northeast, AccuWeather accurately predicted there would be little impact in New York City, which ultimately only received 1.2 inches of snow. Other sources predicted up to 6 inches of snow.</p><p>Forbesmagazine dubbed ForecastWatch \"the JD Power of weather prediction\" and, according to Myers, these latest studies, in addition to numerous real-life examples of forecast accuracy, demonstrate once again why AccuWeather forecasts are the most trusted to provide actionable insights to help people and business better cope with the impact of weather.</p><p>About AccuWeather, Inc. and AccuWeather.com - AccuWeather, recognized and documented as the most accurate source of weather forecasts and warnings in the world, has saved tens of thousands of lives, prevented hundreds of thousands of injuries and tens of billions of dollars in property damage.

This could have an effect on who qualifies for the next round of the competition, particularly in Pool A, which includes hosts Japan.</p><p>A pivotal Pool A match between Japan and Scotland at 7:45 p.m. local time will go ahead, World Cup organizers said Sunday.</p><p>A win for Scotland would see it draw level on points with Japan, after which bonus points -- awarded for scoring four or more tries or losing within seven points -- would come into play to decide who reaches the quarterfinals.</p><p>A cancellation -- and a draw -- would see Japan qualify in second place and face New Zealand in the quarters. Ireland would top the group and face South Africa in the final eight if, as expected, it defeats Samoa. If the match goes ahead and Japan wins, it could take the theoretically easier game against the Springboks and leave Ireland to face the All Blacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, all activities scheduled for the Japanese Grand Prix were canceled Saturday, according to Formula One.

Compiled by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), parented by the\u00a0United Nations Economic and Social Council, the report documents impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security and land and marine ecosystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Described as the flagship UN study, theWMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, leading international experts, scientific institutions and United Nations agencies. It provides authoritative information for policy makers on the need for Climate Action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report confirms information in a provisional statement issued at the UN Climate Change Conference in December that 2019 was the second warmest year in the instrumental record. 2015-2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850.</p><p>The study alerts that 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1\u00b0C above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Ni\u00f1o event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend.</p><p>\"We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for,\" said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in a foreword to the report.</p><p>\"Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at a press conference on March 10 launching the report.</p><p>\"We just had the warmest January on record. Winter was unseasonable: mild in many parts of the northern hemisphere. Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in CO2 emissions. Reported record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier which will have repercussions for sea level rise,\" said Mr Taalas.</p><p>\"Temperature is one indicator of ongoing climate change. Changes in the global distribution of rainfall have had a major impact on several countries. Sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, largely due to the thermal expansion of sea water as well as melting of the largest glaciers, like in Greenland and Antarctica. This is exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas,\" added Mr Taalas.</p><p>As the study points out, more than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. In 2019, ocean heat content down to a depth of 2 kilometres exceeded the previous record highs set in 2018.</p><p>Ocean warmingtoo has widespread impacts on the climate system and contributes more than 30% of sea level rise through thermal expansion of sea water. It is altering ocean currents and indirectly altering storm tracks and melting floating ice shelves. Together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation, ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems.</p><p>In 2019, the ocean experienced on average nearly two months of unusually warm temperatures. At least 84% of the ocean experienced at least one marine heatwave.</p><p>Furthermore,in the decade 2009-2018, the ocean absorbed around 23% of annual CO2emissions, cushioning the impacts of climate change but increasing ocean acidity. The change of pH reduces the ability of marine organisms such as mussels, crustacean and corals to calcify, affecting marine life, growth and reproduction.</p><p>According to the report,deoxygenation alongside ocean warming and acidification is now seen as a major threat to ocean ecosystems and the wellbeing of people that depend on them. Coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%-30% of former cover at 1.5\u00b0C warming, and to less than 1% at 2\u00b0C warming.</p><p>The study highlights further:</p><p>Sea levelhas risen throughout the satellite altimetery record (since 1993), but the rate has increased over that time, mainly due to melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on the record.</p><p>The continued long-term decline ofArctic sea icewas confirmed in 2019. The September monthly average extent (usually the lowest of the year) was the third lowest on record with the daily minimum extent tied for second lowest.</p><p>Until 2016,Antarctic sea iceextent had shown a small long-term increase. In late 2016 this was interrupted by a sudden drop in extent to extreme low values. Since then, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels.</p><p>Preliminary results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate that 2018/19 was the 32nd consecutive year of negative mass balance for selected reference glaciers. Eight out of the ten most negative mass balance years were recorded since 2010.</p><p>Explaining climate-related impacts,the report devotes an extensive section to weather and climate impacts on human health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life. This is based on input from a wide variety of United Nations partners.</p><p>Extreme heat conditions are taking an increasing toll on human health and health systems.</p><p>In 2019, record-setting high temperatures from Australia, India, Japan, and Europe negatively affected health and well-being. In Japan, a major heat wave event resulted in over 100 deaths and an additional 18 000 hospitalizations. In France over 20 000 emergency room were recorded for heat-related illnesses between June and mid-September and during two major summer heatwaves, there were a total of 1462 excess deaths in the affected regions.</p><p>The report continued that changes in climatic conditions since 1950 are making it easier for the Aedes mosquito species to transmit dengue virus, increasing the risk of the occurrence of disease. In parallel, the global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades, and about half of the world population is now at risk of infection. In 2019, the world experienced a large increase in dengue cases.</p><p>The other highlights of the report are:</p><p>Climate variability and extreme weather events are among the key drivers of the recent rise in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe crises. After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again \u2013 over 820 million people suffered from hunger in 2018.</p><p>Among 33 countries affected by food crises in 2018, climate variability and weather extremes a compounding driver together with economic shocks and conflict in 26 countries and the leading driver in 12 of the 26. In light of this, the global community faces an enormous challenge to meet the Zero Hunger target of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p><p>The food security situation deteriorated markedly in 2019 in some countries of the Greater Horn of Africa due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict and violence. By late 2019, about 22.2million people, (6.7million in Ethiopia, 3.1million in Kenya, 2.1million in Somalia, 4.5million in South Sudan, 5.8million in the Sudan) were estimated to be severely food insecure, only slightly lower than during the severe and prolonged drought in 2016-17.</p><p>There was exceptional dryness in March and much of April followed by unusually heavy rainfall and floods in October-December. The unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the severe desert locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa region - the worst in over 25 years, and the most serious in 70 years for Kenya. This is expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.</p><p>More than 6.7 million new internal disaster displacements were recorded between January and June 2019, triggered by hydrometeorological events such as Cyclone Idai in Southeast Africa, Cyclone Fani in South Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. This number was forecast to reach close to 22 million in 2019, up from 17.2 million in 2018. Of all natural hazards, floods and storms contributed most to displacement.</p><p>Also drought affected many parts of southeast Asia and Australia, which had its driest year on record, influenced by the strong positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole.</p><p>Southern Africa, Central America and parts of South America received abnormally low precipitation amounts.</p><p>Australia finished the year where it started: with extreme heat. The 2018-2019 summer was the hottest on record, as was December. Australia's hottest area-averaged day on record (41.9\u00b0C ) was on December 18. Australia's seven hottest days on record, and nine of the 10 hottest, occurred in 2019.</p><p>Two major heatwaves occurred in Europe in late June and late July. In France, a national record of 46.0\u00b0C (1.9\u00b0C above the previous record) was set on 28 June at V\u00e9rargues. National records were also set in Germany (42.6\u00b0C), the Netherlands (40.7\u00b0C), Belgium (41.8\u00b0C), Luxembourg (40.8\u00b0C) and the United Kingdom (38.7\u00b0C), with the heat also extending into the Nordic countries, where Helsinki had its highest temperature on record (33.2\u00b0C on 28 July).</p><p>It was also an above-average fire year in several high-latitude regions, including Siberia (Russian Federation) and Alaska (US), with fire activity occurring in some parts of the Arctic where it was previously extremely rare.</p><p>The severe drought in Indonesia and neighbouring countries led to the most significant fire season since 2015. The number of reported fires in Brazil's Amazonia region was only slightly above the 10-year average, but total fire activity in South America was the highest since 2010, with Bolivia and Venezuela among the countries with particularly active fire years.</p><p>Australia experienced an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season in the later part of 2019 with repeated major outbreaks which continued into January 2020. As of early 2020, 33 deaths had been reported and over 2000 properties had been lost, while a total of about 7 million hectares had been burnt in New South Wales and Victoria.</p><p>Daily total wildfire CO2emissions generally followed the 2003-2018 average, according to the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service ECMWF Global Fire Assimilation System dataset. The largest increases above the 17-year mean in July, August, September and the end of December corresponding to the peak activity of wildfires in the Arctic/Siberia, Indonesia and Australia respectively.</p><p>Tropical cyclone activity globally in 2019 was above average. The Northern Hemisphere had 72 tropical cyclones. The 2018-19 Southern Hemisphere season was also above average, with 27 cyclones.</p><p>Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March as one of the strongest known on the east coast of Africa, resulting in many casualties and widespread devastation. Idai contributed to the complete destruction of close to 780000 ha of crops in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, further undermining a precarious food security situation in the region. The cyclone also resulted in at least 50905 displaced persons in Zimbabwe, 53237 in southern Malawi and 77019 in Mozambique.</p><p>One of the year's most intense tropical cyclones was Dorian, which made landfall with category 5 intensity in the Bahamas.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, RENAISSANCERE HOLDINGS LTD.: Thanks, Keith. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We begin 2020 looking and feeling very different as a company from where we started 1 year ago. This journey charted a very intentional path designed to make RenRe not only more resilient, but also a broader, deeper and better partner to our customers.</p><p>It has been a long and deliberate track, one that is not yet complete, but successfully underway. It has taken us to where we now have a diversified book evenly divided between Property and Casualty and Specialty business. This change was at the behest of our customers who asked us to deepen and broaden our relationship with them, but also because we saw a path to greater efficiency. I am pleased with where we currently are and excited about our future course.</p><p>Last year, I started the call in January by asking 2 questions. 1 year on, I think we should ask ourselves the same 2 questions. The first is, how is our financial performance? And the second is, have we achieved the year's goals and effectively executed our strategy?</p><p>Starting with question 1, how is our financial performance? We grew book value per share by 15.7% and tangible book value per share plus accumulated dividends by 17.9%. For the year, our return on equity was 14.1%, and our operating return on equity was 8%. In our Casualty segment, we generated a consistent diversifying underwriting profit. Bob will discuss our financial results in more detail later, but I believe we've performed well, especially against a difficult background.</p><p>In 2019, our industry experienced approximately $75 billion of insured catastrophe losses, including Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis in Japan, and Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean. In addition, loss creep on prior year events continued to plague the industry.</p><p>In Casualty lines, the market is recognizing rate is required as losses are being impacted by social inflation from exponentially increasing jury verdicts and adverse development on recent prior accident years. For the industry, third-party capital was constrained in 2019 due to poor returns, mounting loss creep and concerns over climate change. Against this backdrop, we deployed more capital, both in respect to our own capital as well as the capital we manage on behalf of our partners.</p><p>Our partner capital increased by $1.3 billion in 2019, with an additional $525 million raised for the January 1, 2020, renewal. This highlights our ability to procure the most efficient capital for multiple sources and provides us considerable underwriting capital and financial flexibility heading into what we expect to be the best market opportunities we've seen in years. So in answer to the first question, I'm satisfied with our financial performance and the returns we have generated in 2019.</p><p>Moving on to question 2, how -- have we achieved the year's goals and effectively executed our strategy? We began the year with several goals. First was quickly and effectively integrating TMR's people, systems and risk into RenRe. Second was organically growing our business in a strengthening market, and third was increasing the operational efficiency of our organization by growing operating and corporate expenses slower than premiums.</p><p>I'm proud to report we outperformed on these goals. Bob will update you on the TMR integration, but it is essentially complete. An important element of the integration was to continue executing our strategy and organically growing the business. As the markets improved, we focused on expanding and deploying more capital. Finally, our operational and capital leverage continued to improve. And over the previous 3 years, we have more than doubled our gross premiums written while only growing shareholders' equity by 22% and increasing run rate expenses by only 13%.</p><p>Just as critical as accomplishing these goals effectively was doing so expediently. In 2019, we moved quickly and efficiently to position ourselves to execute into an improving market. Most of the heavy lifting is now behind us, and we have the increased scale, better tools, superior access to risk and financial resources necessary to outperform in 2020. So in conclusion, 2019 was an exceptional year when viewed against these strategic objectives.</p><p>I'll provide more details on the January 1 renewal and opportunities we are expecting in 2020 later in the call, but first, let me turn it over to Bob to talk about our financials. Bob?</p><p>ROBERT QUTUB, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, RENAISSANCERE HOLDINGS LTD.: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by saying we had a good year. We executed strongly, both financially and operationally during the quarter and the year. Today, I will divide my remarks between our fourth quarter and year-end 2019 results. I'll first discuss our consolidated financial performance before moving on to our segment results, investment portfolio returns, and finally, capital activities.</p><p>Starting with our consolidated results and beginning with the fourth quarter, where our annualized return on average common equity was 2.5%, and our annualized operating return on average common equity was 1.7%. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $905 million, up $358 million or 65% from the comparable quarter last year. About 2/3 of this was organic growth. We reported net income for the quarter of $34 million or $0.77 per diluted common share.</p><p>Our operating income was $23 million or $0.52 per diluted common share. Operating income excludes $18 million of net realized and unrealized gains on investments, and $5.7 million of transaction, integration and compensation expenses associated with the TMR integration. We had an underwriting loss for the quarter of $65 million and reported an overall combined ratio of 106.7%.</p><p>Now before moving on to our full year results, I'd like to provide more clarity on how the noncontrolling interest from our joint ventures impact our financial statements. Each quarter, we fully consolidate the results of DaVinci, Medici and Vermeer. And since we do not own 100% of these entities, we remove the portion of their returns that we do not own.</p><p>For example, 100% of DaVinci's results are included in our underwriting and investment income. However, because we only own 22% of DaVinci, we removed 78% of DaVinci's returns from our net income. This elimination is reflected in the income statement as the net loss or income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Therefore, when these ventures produce positive returns, the elimination of the income attributable to third-party investors is reflected as a reduction to our net income. Likewise, when these ventures have negative results, the elimination is reflected as an increase to our net income.</p><p>We have added a new page to the financial supplement that provides a breakdown of the components of the noncontrolling interest adjustment. This has always been reflected in our 10-K and 10-Q, but given the increasing significance, we thought it would be helpful if we included it in the financial supplement. As you will see in the new disclosure, for the quarter, we reflected a positive noncontrolling interest of $2.6 million. While both Vermeer and Medici produced positive returns for the quarter, these were more than offset by negative returns in DaVinci, resulting in a net overall loss for these vehicles, which is reflected as a positive noncontrolling interest adjustment.</p><p>Now moving on to the full year 2019, where we grew our book value per share by 15.7%, and tangible book value per share plus accumulated dividends by 17.9%. We realized a return on average common equity of 14.1%, and an operating return on average common equity of 8%. We reported net income of $712 million for the year, or $16.29 per diluted common share, and our operating income was $403 million or $9.13 per diluted common share. In 2019, our overall combined ratio was 92.3%. Net premiums earned for 2019 were $3.3 billion, up $1.4 billion or 69% year-over-year.</p><p>Now before moving to our segment results, I'd like to update you on our operational efficiency. Our direct expenses, which are the sum of our operational and corporate expenses, totaled $82 million for the quarter, which is an increase of $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2018. However, the ratio of direct expense to net premiums earned was 8.5%, a decrease of almost 4 percentage points for the same period last year. Likewise, for the year, direct expenses were up by $105 million to $317 million, while the ratio of direct expense to net premiums earned decreased by 1.2 percentage points in 2019 to 9.5%. Adjusting for the impact of $50 million in TMR integration costs incurred in 2019, direct expenses would have been $267 million for the year or 8% of net premiums earned.</p><p>Now moving on to our segments, and starting with our Property segment. Property gross premiums written grew by $45 million or 23% over the comparative quarter to $245 million. This growth was driven by an increase in other property of $109 million. The growth in other property was partially offset by a $64 million decline in property cat gross premiums written. We do not typically write much property cat in the fourth quarter outside of reinstatement premiums, which were down this year, reflective of loss activity and business mix. Other property is becoming a larger percentage of our overall property book, and for the year, it makes up 34% of property gross premiums written compared to 23% in 2018.</p><p>As a reminder, we access proportional business through our other property book, and due to the nature of this business, it carries a higher acquisition expense ratio. As this business becomes a greater part of the Property segment, acquisition expenses may increase. Our Property segment reported an underwriting loss of $87 million and a combined ratio of 118.6% in the fourth quarter, with property catastrophe reporting a 141% combined ratio and other property reporting an 88.6% combined ratio.</p><p>Current quarter losses in property cat were primarily driven by Typhoon Hagibis. On our last call, we announced an estimated net negative impact for the fourth quarter related to Typhoon Hagibis of approximately $175 million. We remain comfortable with this estimate. As you saw in our financials, we have allocated $128 million of net negative impact specifically to Hagibis, with the remainder being incurred under our aggregate covers. So to be clear, our estimate has not changed.</p><p>We have also reallocated $22 million in net negative impact from the third quarter events to 2019 aggregate losses. While this reallocation primarily relates to Typhoon Faxai, our estimates for both Faxai and Dorian remain the same at $103 million and $52 million, respectively.</p><p>For the year, gross premiums written in our Property segment grew by $670 million or 38%. This broke down to growth of $246 million or 18% in our property catastrophe class of business, and $424 million or 103% in our other property class of business. For the full year, our Property segment reported underwriting income of $209 million and a combined ratio of 87%.</p><p>Now moving on to the Casualty segment, where our gross premiums written were up $313 million or 90% in the fourth quarter of 2019 over the comparative quarter. Approximately 2/3 of this quarterly growth was organic. We reported underwriting income of $21 million and a combined ratio of 95.9% for the quarter. The current and accident year loss ratio for the Casualty segment was 68%. For the year, gross premiums written were up $827 million or 53%. About half of this growth was organic. The segment reported underwriting income of $46 million and a combined ratio of 97% for the year.</p><p>Now moving to fee income, where total fee income was $13 million for the quarter, with management fees contributing $24 million and performance fees being negative $11 million. The negative performance fees were driven by the cat activity in the quarter, primarily Hagibis, which triggered the reversal of previously accrued performance fees. Overall, our quarterly fee income was up by $5 million relative to the comparable quarter. For the year, total fee income was $114 million, up $24 million from 2018.</p><p>Now turning to investments. We posted total investment results of $131 million for the fourth quarter, which includes mark-to-market gains of $18 million. For the year, total investment results were $838 million, with $415 million in mark-to-market gains. Our fixed maturity and short-term investment return for the quarter was $97 million, and overall net investment income for the quarter was $113 million, almost flat compared to the third quarter. This quarter, we have enhanced our disclosures in the financial supplement to include retained total investment result. This delineates the net investment income and mark-to-market results that apply to our retained investment portfolio. In short, this is the quarterly investment return that contributes to our net income, and the remainder is what belongs to our partner capital.</p><p>Of the $113 million of the net investment income, we retained $91 million, a retention of about 80%, which is consistent with the full year 2019 and 2018. In the fourth quarter, our managed investment portfolio reported yield to maturity of 2.1% and duration of 2.9 years on assets of $15.7 billion, while our retained investment portfolio reported yield to maturity of 2.2% and duration of 3.6 years on assets of $11.2 billion.</p><p>Now moving on to capital management. The fourth quarter was once again active from a capital management perspective. As Kevin mentioned, we had a successful capital raise in preparation for 1/1 renewals, raising over $525 million in Upsilon and Medici, effective January 2020. This is in addition to the $1.3 billion in partner capital that we raised across our various joint ventures in 2019.</p><p>Looking forward to 2020. On March 15, the $250 million tranche of 5.75% senior notes will mature. As a reminder, last year, we issued $400 million of 3.6% senior notes due in 2029. Consequently, we remain in a strong capital and liquidity position going into 2020, and with an improving interest rate environment, anticipate additional opportunities to deploy capital into the business. As such, we did not repurchase any of our shares during the fourth quarter.</p><p>Before I turn it back over to Kevin, I want to update you on a change that we'll be making to our operating income calculation starting in the first quarter of 2020. As you know, operating income excludes net realized and unrealized gains on investments attributable to shareholders, transaction, integration and compensation expenses associated with the TMR acquisition, and income tax impact associated with these exclusions. With the addition of TMR and their nondollar balance sheet, we will be refining our methodology to also exclude foreign exchange gains and losses. While we hedge our economic FX exposure, we sometimes experience accounting-driven volatility that, over time, should be relatively neutral in terms of bottom line impact.</p><p>And finally, I'd like to update you on our TMR acquisition. With the 1/1 renewal behind us, we have re-underwritten effectively all of the TMR book, renewing the deals which met our strategic and financial thresholds. We exceeded the 2 primary metrics that we set out at the time of the acquisition as we retain greater than $700 million of TMR premium and will achieve an after-tax earnings run rate contribution greater than $100 million by the end of Q1 2020. When I think about the integration, it's the operational successes behind the financial ones that are even more important. We have a single view of risk. Our key systems are integrated. We have deepened our bench strength, and our people are working extremely well together. Going into 2020, we will benefit from the increased scale and operational efficiency that TMR has brought us. Because of the significant time and effort we spent on integration activities in 2019, we are free from distraction and well positioned to capture opportunities in this improving market.</p><p>And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Kevin for more details on our segments.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Thanks, Bob. I'll divide my comments between our Property segment and our Casualty and Specialty segment, starting with a discussion of 2019 results and then moving to the January 1 renewal and opportunities for 2020. After that, we'll take your questions.</p><p>For the full year in 2019, we grew gross written premiums in our Property segment by $670 million or 38% to $2.4 billion. A substantial portion was organic. Particularly, the 103% growth in other property reflects the opportunity that we've seen in E&amp;S property markets. We experienced a number of large natural catastrophes in the quarter. Last quarter, we preannounced and continue to hold $175 million net negative impact from Typhoon Hagibis, which was based on a $15 billion industry loss. We are monitoring the reports on Hagibis and expect to learn more as we approach the 4/1 renewal. And if the facts change, so will our estimate.</p><p>Last year, I discussed the impact of Hurricane Irma's loss creep, and noted it would be, by itself, one of the largest events in 2018. Fast forward 1 year, and we continue to experience billions of dollars of loss creep in Florida, and not only from Hurricane Irma, which made landfall 2.5 years ago, but now also from Hurricane Michael, which struck almost 1.5 years ago. Suffice it to say, we have not yet realized the benefits of last year's AOB reforms. This is deeply disappointing.</p><p>Several Florida domestics are now close to exhausting their 2017 private market reinsurance. This is yet another indicator of the deep structural problems afflicting Florida. In addition, as I discussed last quarter, Florida is increasingly exposed to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, increased rainfall and flooding, and intensifying hurricanes. Although it is easy to talk about the June renewal, I can say that these 2 factors are materially impacting our view of Florida and will result in the need for substantial rate increases.</p><p>Florida has always been and will always be an important market for RenRe. We have been leaders in this business for decades. That said, we reduced our exposure to Florida domestic companies last year and are prepared to do so again if rate increases do not meet our return hurdles. At the same time, we are exploring additional means for accessing wind risk in this market.</p><p>2019 was an active year for Japan, with Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis causing widespread damage. Loss creep from Typhoon Jebi also continues to be an issue. Our team of scientists, meteorologists and engineers believe that climate change will further increase the natural catastrophe risk Japan faces. Sea level rise will intensify. Storm surge, rainfalls will increase and average typhoon intensity will be stronger, and there will be more typhoons of Category 4 intensity or greater. Typhoons Hagibis and Faxai are likely portents of the impact that climate change will have on Japan. We have underwritten the Japanese market for 25 years and greatly value the long-term relationships we have developed with our clients.</p><p>Taken as a whole, however, the unprecedented scale of storms in Japan over the last 2 years has caused us to increase our view of typhoon risk. Unfortunately, the price increases the Japanese market experienced last year have been more than offset by the post-renewal loss creep from Typhoon Jebi. Substantial rate increases are needed at 4/1 to accurately reflect Japan's elevated level of risk.</p><p>As I discussed on our Q3 conference call, the property market experienced a V-shaped renewal at January 1. Both primary insurance and retro rates were up materially, but reinsurance rates on loss-free business were only up slightly. Loss-affected business, such as treaties exposed to California wildfires, experienced material rate increases at renewal, and complex commercial risks were more stressed.</p><p>A key element of our strategy is to build options to access the full spectrum of risk, which allows us to adjust our portfolio mix between different classes of business, increasing on the best and decreasing on the worst. So while our top line premium increased marginally, the underlying business mix shifted materially to focus on the most profitable lines. We wrote less primary reinsurance risk. We sold more retro as its rates were more attractive, but it was most efficient against our partner capital and we will recognize this benefit through increased fees.</p><p>Finally, we grew our other property book materially as this is how we access primary property. As a reminder, we take cat risk in our other property portfolio, and in 2020, we have additional exposure to cat activity from this portfolio. The net impact, overall, of these changes is a more profitable property book that consumes less capital in the tail.</p><p>We continue to share risk through traditional retro and other structures. While retro has become more expensive relative to recent years, we've strategically focused our purchase to continue to support our clients, while maximizing the efficiency of our retained underwriting portfolio. Our latest Mona Lisa cat bond transaction was a key component of our gross to net strategy, providing $400 million of protection at relatively attractive pricing. The retro capacity we raised through Mona Lisa is very efficient capital, leaving us in a strong position heading into 2020.</p><p>It has been several years since we last accessed the cat bond market, and our ability to do so successfully is yet another indicator of our agility in sourcing the most efficient capital as market conditions change. Our partner capital business augmented our gross to net strategy at the January 1 renewal. DaVinci, Upsilon and Vermeer provided us with additional flexibility to match desirable risk with efficient capital at a time that retro markets have diminished capacity.</p><p>Looking forward, the pricing beat cannot continue indefinitely. In 2020, we anticipate property rates will continue to increase, especially in the U.S. and Japan. We also expect retro and E&amp;S to remain attractive. I'm optimistic about both the opportunities that will present themselves and our superior positioning to benefit from them.</p><p>For the year, we grew gross written premiums in our Casualty and Specialty segment by 53%. This is across all subclasses, reflecting a mix of organic growth as well as the impact of TMR, and resulting in a better balanced and more diverse portfolio. We construct our casualty portfolio to have an attractive return on risk and continue to achieve scale in this segment. As a result, we are generating a stable diversifying earnings stream, producing $46 million of net underwriting income and a combined ratio of 97 for the year.</p><p>Casualty and Specialty markets were broadly up at the January 1 renewal. Rate increases achieved by our customers have been above plan and expected to continue in 2020. We believe this rate change is greater than the increase in loss trends. We also saw significant improvements in terms and conditions, including broad-based reductions in ceding commissions that were also larger than anticipated. The improved trading conditions should be sustainable for the foreseeable future as insurance companies have recognized the need for rate and have been disciplined in decreasing supply to the market. As we move into 2020, these improved trading conditions should allow us to continue to profitably scale our casualty business, resulting in improved operational leverage and consistent underwriting profit.</p><p>Social inflation continues to impact the casualty industry. Our casualty underwriters have navigated effectively this market by being rigorous about selecting the best risks and overweighting our portfolio in the more attractive classes, while avoiding the most challenging. We benefit from close coordination between our underwriters, claims, reserving and pricing functions, and are aided by tools that allow us to quickly recognize loss trends. More importantly, we have a strong underwriting culture that focuses on the bottom line.</p><p>So the fourth quarter was a solid close to a strong year, which we rapidly and effectively integrated TMR, materially grew our top line while increasing our operational efficiency, all while delivering strong underwriting and investment results. As always, we remain resolutely focused on executing our strategy and maximizing shareholder value and are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2020 to deploy material capital at increasingly attractive returns.</p><p>Thank you. And with that, we'll turn it over to questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous.</p><p>RYAN JAMES TUNIS, PARTNER OF PROPERTY &amp; CASUALTY INSURANCE, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I had a couple. The first one is just thinking about, I guess, the cat loss activity in 2019. It seems like Ren's market share of that on a net basis was a little bit higher than it was in '17 and '18, if we think about maybe like a $60 billion industry cat year. I'm wondering, how much of that growth do you think was attributable to the actual growth in the size of your book or the nature or the type of loss events we experienced?</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: So yes, I think that's a good question. And I think sometimes thinking about what's an average cat year from an industry perspective, it's difficult to relate it to what happens with the reinsurance portfolio. What happened last year is we had several large events. We had Hagibis, Faxai, Dorian, all of which as events become larger, there's going to be a disproportionate effect on reinsurance. I think the things affecting us on 2019 are: we had a different retro protections in 2019 than we had in 2018, and where the storms hit were places where we had a little bit less retro. So we have -- tend to protect the southeast wind pretty aggressively, and we had the losses in Japan, which is a little bit more of a net book.</p><p>The size of the book, which is the second part of your question, played a role. But that was not the biggest component of it. It was much more around the size of the retro we have protecting the portfolio.</p><p>RYAN JAMES TUNIS: Understood. And then on the Specialty Casualty side, I guess, obviously, you talked about how you're being vigilant about the tort trends and all that. I'm just curious, did -- has any of that had an impact on your loss picks here in 2019? Or is it one of those things where you're kind of monitoring it, and maybe not releasing reserves quite as fast? I'm just curious if the actual tort environment has put any upward pressure on your loss ratio in Casualty Specialty?</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Let me start with pricing, and then I'll move to reserving. From a pricing perspective, what I mentioned is, I think the rate change that we're seeing is above the loss trend that we're observing. So our pricing curves, our pricing picks are actually dropping. We are not moving that to our reserving ratios, though. So our reserving ratios are consistent with what they've been historically, but where we are observing trend, we are making adjustments and pushing the ultimate expected up. So we are reflecting the change in trend in our legacy book, and we are not recognizing the improved pricing terms in the current renewals.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR, SENIOR ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just had a question on the Casualty business. How have -- like as you reserve, are you -- have you been overly conservative in your reserves, given the social inflation issues that you've observed? Or are you basically assuming that the trends will be consistent with how they've been, but not get worse?</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Reserving is always an area of focus for any risk-taking company in this business, and it's something we put a lot of attention to. We believe that our picks are appropriate, and we take in all factors that we think will affect the ultimate dates. So we are looking at loss trend, we are looking at rate environments. We have historic rate monitoring tools. All of that is resonant within the picks that we have, but we feel like they are appropriate, and we stand by them as our best estimate.</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR: Yes. I think the reason I was asking is, in response to the previous question, you sort of implied that you've been adjusting your pricing for it, but you're not building in an extra cushion in your reserves if trends continue to deteriorate.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Yes. So there's always -- looking at our book there, historically, is a difference between reserving -- and what reserving actuaries will reserve and what pricing actuaries will expect. We do -- as a general rule, we wait for development of about 30% of the curve before we take any measure that would be considered to be a positive trend in pricing. So even if our pricing actuaries are accurate in their assessment of today's risk, it will take a couple of years before that would be reflected by our actuaries. It's just the nature of the reserving process.</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR: Okay. And then on your cat business, in terms of premium, fourth quarter is obviously not a good, big quarter. Your premiums were down, but it's usually not a big quarter anyway seasonally. What are you seeing in terms of primary company behavior in terms of purchase of cat insurance? Just -- are companies buying more or less given how much prices have gone up?</p><p>ROBERT QUTUB: It's -- if I have to put a blanket statement out, I would say the demand for reinsurance is relatively flat. There are some new purchases from some larger players that have come into the market. I think we have great relationships and great access, so we tend to have opportunities where there is even limited growth. But if you ask for a blanket statement, I would say relatively flat.</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR: Okay. And then just lastly, if I could ask one more. You seem fairly positive on pricing, and it seems like you're confident that 4/1 and midyear renewals, you'll continue to see upward moves in pricing. What gives you that comfort, given that some of the issues that have caused the soft pricing over the past few years, like excess capital in the industry, those are still out there? So just if you could share some insights on why you're optimistic about pricing.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Yes. The comments that you're referring to will have to do with the property cat renewals at 4/1 and...</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR: Yes.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: So I'll comment on that. At 4/1, we have had ongoing discussions with our partners in Japan. They recognize that the change that was put through the market for Jebi was inadequate based on the development that we've seen since 4/1 on Jebi. In addition, the size of Hagibis and the size of Faxai, I think, will become more clear as we approach the 4/1 renewal. And historically, the Japanese market has responded as good partners. When there's losses to recognize, there is a need for additional rate.</p><p>Within Florida, I think there's a substantial structural issue in Florida. We've seen loss creep, we've seen ineffective legislation change with regard to AOB. And as we look at that market, our view is it goes up or we reduce. So I'm not going to forecast what the change will be, but I will say, unless we see changes that meet our return expectations, we will reduce in 2020, like we did in 2019.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Well, we appreciate you joining today's call. Thank you for tuning in, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference call.

The storm delivered high winds and record-breaking precipitation to a large portion of Honshu from Mie Prefecture in the west to Iwate in the north. Storm surge raised sea levels by more than 1 meter above mean sea level along parts of the coast.  The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its Level 5, or highest level, special warning for heavy rain; unprecedented rainfall followed. A wide swath of Honshu just outside the Tokyo metro area received between 250 mm and 500+ mm (10 and 20+ inches) of rain; the resort town of Hakone, where 939.5 mm (37 inches) of precipitation was recorded, broke the calendar-day rainfall record for all of Japan.

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa, with opening remarks from Mr. Derek Bulas. Mr. Bulas, please begin.</p><p>DEREK BULAS, ASSOCIATE VP OF LEGAL, FAIRFAX FINANCIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED: Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2019 year-end results. This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under Risk Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian securities regulators and is available on SEDAR.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, FAIRFAX FINANCIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED: Thank you, Derek. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's 2019 year-end conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on -- pass the call on to Jen Allen, our chief information -- Chief Financial Officer, for additional financial and accounting details. But to begin today's conference call, I'd like to comment on last night's press release announcing Paul Rivett's retirement. Paul told me recently that for family reasons, he wanted to retire as President of Fairfax, and it was with great sadness that I accepted his decision. For 17 years, Paul has given us all and has been instrumental in our success over that time. I've had the pleasure of working very closely with Paul all those years, and I will miss him greatly. He retires with our gratitude and with all our best wishes to him, his wife Janice and his children and his retirement. Paul will continue to work on projects for us and will remain the chairman of the boards of some of our noninsurance investments. So we thank you very much, Paul, and Paul is here with us. Paul?</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Thank you, Prem. As -- Prem, as you said, I started at Fairfax in late 2003 and became the President 7 years ago and began doing these conference calls 2 years ago at the end of 2018 and working with you and the entire Fairfax family has been a joy and an honor and a privilege. There is no better place to work. It's always been fun at Fairfax, whether defending the organization or helping grow the company over the years, working with such talented people and assisting other businesses and individuals along the way. Over the last 2 decades with this fantastic team and atmosphere, I've given everything I had to help better this business, and it has been great fun. It is for personal reasons that I've decided to step back from working to spend more time with my family. And that said, as Prem mentioned, I will continue to sit on the Board of several Fairfax investee companies. To Prem, the entire Fairfax family and all our great shareholders, I'm so grateful for my time at Fairfax, and I look forward to watching the exciting future of the organization continue to unfold. Thank you, Prem, for everything.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Hey, thank you, Paul. And Paul, of course, will be at our AGM, and you'll have a chance to say hi to Paul.</p><p>So ladies and gentlemen, we'll just go right into fourth quarter call, year-end call. Fairfax's net earnings were $2 billion in 2019 versus $376 million in 2018, which equates to net earnings per share of approximately $70 per share versus $11.65 in 2018. Fairfax's book value per share in 2019 increased by 14.8%, adjusted for the $10 per share common dividend paid in the quarter of -- first quarter of 2019. The book value ends the year at $486 per share. We had record earnings, as I said, in 2019, at just over $2 billion, but became just shy of our 15% target for growth in book value. If not for some foreign exchange movements and pension expense that went through other comprehensive earnings, we'd have passed 15%.</p><p>Our companies continue to have good results with a strong combined ratio of 96.9% consolidated, strong reserves and producing an underwriting profit of $395 million for the year. All of our major insurance companies generated combined ratios of less than 100%, with Zenith leading the charge at 85.2%, Northbridge at 96.2%, Brit at 96.9%, Odyssey at 97.2%, Allied World at 97.5% and Crum &amp; Forster at 97.6%.</p><p>For the year, operating income was strong at $1.1 billion, and our net gains on investments for the year were $1.7 billion. This consisted of realized gains in our investment portfolios of $612 million that includes ICICI Lombard, BDT, Brookfield and Seaspan, and unrealized gains of $1.1 billion, principally Eurobank, CIB bank, BDT, Go Digit and Seaspan.</p><p>As we've mentioned at our annual meetings and in our annual reports and quarterly calls with IFRS accounting where stocks and bonds are recorded at market, and subject to mark-to-market gains or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate, and investment results will only make sense over the long term. Of course, these results were after taking mark-to-market losses in BlackBerry, EXCO, Stelco and Fairfax Africa.</p><p>Underwriting income continued to increase with a lower consolidated combined ratio and strong organic growth continuing at our companies. Our insurance and reinsurance business net for written premium increased year-over-year by approximately 10%, in addition to an increase of 9% in 2018, primarily due to growth at Northbridge, Odyssey, Crum &amp; Forster and Allied World. Zenith is our only company not seeing premium increases as workers' compensation rates in the United States continue to decrease. At the subsidiary level, the change in net premiums written for the year and the fourth quarter were as follows: Odyssey Group for 2019 up 17%, and the fourth quarter up 25%; Crum &amp; Forster for the whole year 18%, for the fourth quarter 27%; Northbridge 15%, for the fourth quarter 20%; Zenith was down 9% for the year and minus -- and down 7% for the quarter; Brit was flat for the year as Lloyd's restructuring took place, and for the fourth quarter, they were down 7%; Allied World was up 6% for the year 2019, and 7% for the quarter. So you can see on a quarterly basis, our -- the premiums would have been increasing very significantly. If you look at on a quarterly basis and for the whole year 2019, first quarter was up 4%, this is the net written premium; second quarter, plus-6%; third quarter, plus-12% and fourth quarter plus-13%. And these are mainly because of rate increases. Rate increases have been accelerating during the year, and we expect this trend to continue in 2020. We continue to look to put more of our cash to work without reaching for yield or taking duration risk. Over the last 24 months, we have invested our cash and short-term U.S. treasuries and short-term investment grade bonds. We have also deployed some of our cash into real estate and mortgages. We now have an annual run rate of approximately $850 million in interest and dividend income and continue to focus on redeploying cash.</p><p>In December, as you saw in the press release, the company entered into an agreement to sell a 40% equity interest and its wholly owned European runoff group for cash of approximately $600 million to OMERS. Pursuant to the sale, OMERS and the company will jointly manage the European runoff after completion of the sale, which we expect to happen in the first quarter. With our partners, we hope to work together to help European runoff expand, given the many opportunities that they are seeing there in London, particularly. At the closing date, the company will deconsolidate European runoff from its runoff reporting segment and apply the equity method of accounting for its remaining equity interest. The transaction, of course, is subject to regulatory approval, and as I said, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. The assets and liabilities of European runoff are presented as held for sale in the company's consolidated balance sheet at year-end.</p><p>We remain conservatively positioned with common shareholders' equity of $13 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $11.8 billion in the previous year, and holding company cash and marketable securities at $1.1 billion. Always looking to be soundly financed first, we have begun to repurchase our partners' interest in our insurance companies as well as repurchasing Fairfax shares. During 2019, we repurchased 479,000 shares and since the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately 2 years, we have purchased over 1.2 million Fairfax shares.</p><p>Fairfax India had an excellent year in 2019 as its book value per share increased by almost 22% to 16.89%, almost $17 a share. Bangalore International Airport had an increase in its valuation because of its second runway and second terminal and a validating investment by a third-party investor for 10% of our position. For more details, please refer to the Fairfax India press release.</p><p>Fairfax Africa had a difficult deal, mainly because of mark-to-market losses in Atlas Mara and CIG, so its net asset value dropped by 9%. We expect its net asset value to come back to $10 per share soon. For more details, again, please refer to the Fairfax Africa press release.</p><p>You'll remember, we continue to hold CPI-linked deflation flow of contracts with a notional amount of $100 billion and an average remaining term to maturity of 2.8 years. We carry these contracts at only $7 million, and they continue to provide us with downside protection in the event of a catastrophic turn of world events. As of December 2019, we have $10 billion in subsidiary cash and short-term investments in our portfolio, which is approximately 26% of our portfolio investments, to take advantage of opportunities that come our way. We have another $5.4 billion of approximately 1-year treasury bills, classified as bonds, and approximately $3.6 billion of high-quality corporate bonds with an average maturity of 1.5 years. In total, we have approximately $19 billion in cash and short-dated securities, which is almost 50% of our portfolio investments. Investment portfolios will be largely unimpacted by rising interest rates as we have not reached the yield. In fact, we will benefit from rising investment income with a run rate of approximately $17 billion in gross premium, a huge focus on underwriting discipline, a portfolio of approximately $38 billion, which does not include the RiverStone U.K. portfolio, which we will continue to manage, and HWIC, our investment subsidiary operating in a stock pickers market, all grounded in our fair and friendly culture built over 34 years. We expect to generate 15% return for our shareholders over time. We think the best is yet to come.</p><p>I will now pass the call over to Jen Allen, our Chief Financial Officer. Jen?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN, CFO, FAIRFAX FINANCIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED: Thank you, Prem. Before I discuss Fairfax's 2019 results. I would like to acknowledge Paul and thank him for his unparalleled support that he's provided to me and the finance team over the years. We wish Paul all the best in his future. We wanted to also provide the readers with -- sorry, we wanted to also let you know that in addition to the press release that was issued yesterday, that all of the details on our 2019 financial results will be made available in our annual report, which will be posted on the company's website on March 6, 2020.</p><p>Turning to Fairfax's consolidated results for the full year 2019. I will highlight the results of our operating companies and then finish with our consolidated financial position. For the full year 2019, Fairfax has reported net earnings of just over $2 billion or $69.79 per share on a fully diluted basis, which as Prem noted, was a record year for the company. That compared to net earnings of $376 million or $11.65 per share on a fully diluted basis in the full year of 2018. The full year 2019 net earnings primarily reflected strong net investment gains and higher interest dividend income and strong underwriting results at the operating companies. Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations in 2019 increased to $395 million with a combined ratio of 96.9%, compared to an underwriting profit of $318 million and a combined ratio of 97.3% in 2018. The increase in underwriting profit of $76 million principally reflected a lower accident year loss ratio, partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Current period catastrophe losses in 2019 totaled $498 million, represented 4.0 combined ratio points, principally related to Typhoon Hagibis at $146 million or 1.2 combined ratio points; Typhoon Faxai at $76 million or 0.6 combined ratio points; and Hurricane Dorian, $66 million or 0.5 combined ratio points. That was lower than the current period catastrophe losses in 2018 of $752 million that represented 6.5 combined ratio points. In 2018, it principally related to the California wildfires, Hurricane Michael and Typhoon Jebi.</p><p>Our combined ratios benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 of $480 million, representing 3.8 combined ratio points. That compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 of $789 million, representing 6.8 combined ratio points. Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 10% in 2019, principally reflecting increases at Odyssey Group, Crum &amp; Forster and Northbridge.</p><p>Looking to our operating company results, starting with Northbridge. Northbridge's underwriting profit of $47 million and a combined ratio of 96.2% in 2019 was fairly consistent with its 2018 underwriting results. 2019 reflected lower non-catastrophe loss experience related to the current accident year, principally improvements in their transportation business. Partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Northbridge's underwriting profit in 2019 included net favorable prior year reserve development of $67 million, representing 5.4 combined ratio points, reflecting better-than-expected loss emergence across all major lines of business. This compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $107 million, representing 9.5 combined ratio point in 2018, reflecting better-than-expected emergence on automobile and casualty lines of business. The underwriting results in 2019 included $12 million that represented 1 combined ratio point of current period catastrophe losses, that principally related to storms in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec. That compared to current period catastrophe losses in 2018 of $19 million that represented 1.7 combined ratio points. In Canadian dollar terms, Northbridge's net premiums written increased by 18% in 2019, reflecting price increases across the group, strong retention of renewal business and growth in the new business.</p><p>Moving on to Odyssey Group, in 2019, Odyssey Group reported an underwriting profit of $90 million at a 97.2% combined ratio compared to an underwriting profit of $181 million at a 93.4% combined ratio in 2018. Lower underwriting profit in 2019 reflected lower net favorable prior year reserve development, and higher current period catastrophe losses. Odyssey Group's combined ratio in 2019 benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $230 million, which represents 7.2 combined ratio points, principally related to better-than-expected emergence on non-catastrophe losses of $148 million, primarily related to better-than-expected emergence from both non-catastrophe loss experience principally in the casualty, auto, marine and aviation lines and property catastrophe loss experience. That compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $346 million or 12.5 combined ratio points in 2018. Current period catastrophe losses of $280 million represented 8.8 combined ratio points in 2019, principally related to Typhoon Hagibis at $88 million or 2.8 combined ratio points; Typhoon Faxai at $42 million or 1.3 combined ratio points; and Hurricane Dorian at $25 million or 0.8 combined ratio points. And that compared to current period catastrophe losses of $252 million that represented 9.1 combined ratio points in 2018, that principally related to the 2018 California wildfires, Hurricane Michael and Typhoon Jebi. Odyssey Group wrote $3.4 billion of net premiums in 2019, which represented an increase of 17% from the prior year. This reflected growth in all divisions, with the majority of the increase related to U.S. insurance, with growth in the U.S. cross motor and financial product lines. The London market in new line -- Odyssey's new line business and its U.S. casualty reinsurance.</p><p>Moving on to Crum &amp; Forster. Crum &amp; Forster's underwriting profit in 2019 improved to $52 million with a combined ratio of 97.6% from an underwriting profit of $33 million and a combined ratio of 98.3% in 2018. The increase in underwriting profit was principally due to higher business volumes and profitable lines of business and lower current period catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased commissions as a result of growth and higher commission lines of business. Crum &amp; Forster's net premium written increased by 18% in 2019, primarily reflecting growth in accident and health, surety and programs, and surplus specialty lines of business.</p><p>Looking to Zenith. Zenith National reported underwriting profit in 2019 of $109 million with an 85.2% combined ratio compared to an underwriting profit of $140 million with an 82.6% combined ratio in 2018. The decrease in underwriting profit in 2019 principally reflected the impact of price decreases due to continued favorable loss trends. The underwriting profit in 2019 included $82 million or 11.2 combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve development which reflected net favorable loss development trends for accident years 2013 through 2018. Net premiums written by Zenith of $721 million in 2019, decreased by 9% from $789 million in 2018, with the decrease primarily reflecting price decreases due to continuing favorable loss trends.</p><p>Brit insurance in 2019 reported an underwriting profit of $51 million and a combined ratio of 96.9%, compared to an underwriting loss of $77 million and a combined ratio of 105.2%. The year-over-year improvement in Brit's underwriting results principally reflected a decrease in current period catastrophe losses and a decrease in the attritional loss ratio, partially offset by a decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development. Current period catastrophe losses of $70 million represented 4.3 combined ratio point in 2019, principally related to Typhoon Hagibis at $25 million or 1.5 combined ratio point; Typhoon Faxai, $12 million or 0.8 combined ratio point; and Hurricane Dorian, $24 million or 1.5 combined ratio points. That was significantly lower than current period catastrophe losses of $210 million that represented 12.7 combined ratio points in 2018 that related to the California wildfires, Typhoon Jebi, Hurricane Florence and Michael. Net favorable prior year reserve development was lower in 2019 at $47 million and represented 2.8 combined ratio points, reflecting better-than-expected claim experience across most lines of business, compared to $99 million that represented 6.0 combined ratio points in 2018. Brit's net premium written decreased by 1% in 2019 after excluding the onetime intercompany reinsurance transaction with runoff in 2018 that's eliminated on consolidation. The decrease reflected an increased use of proportional treaty reinsurance in the marine and property lines of business, partially offset by growth in premiums written, primarily growth in the reinsurance segment. That was partially offset by lower business volumes due to reductions in noncore lines of business.</p><p>Allied World reported an underwriting profit of $58 million and a combined ratio of 97.5% in 2019 compared to an underwriting profit of $43 million and a combined ratio of 98.1% in 2018. The improvement in underwriting profitability principally reflected lower current period catastrophe losses, partially offset by net adverse prior year reserve development in 2019, compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018. Current period losses in 2019 were $85 million or 3.7 combined ratio points, principally related to Typhoon Hagibis at $31 million or 5.7 combined ratio point; Typhoon Faxai at $20 million, 0.8 combined ratio point; Hurricane Dorian, $14 million and 0.6 combined ratio points. That compared to current period catastrophe losses in 2018 of $223 million or 9.8 combined ratio point that principally related to the California wildfires, Typhoon Jebi, Hurricane Florence and Michael. Net adverse prior year reserve development of $32 million or 1.4 combined ratio points in 2019 reflect a deterioration in both the insurance segment and the reinsurance segment, compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $97 million or 4.2 combined ratio points in 2018. Allied World's net premium written increased by 3%, reflecting growth in gross premiums written, partially offset by decreased premium retention, primarily driven by increased reinsurance purchase in their insurance segment.</p><p>Moving to Fairfax Asia. Fairfax Asia's underwriting profit increased to $6 million at a combined ratio of 97.0% in 2019 and that compared to an underwriting profit of $0.4 million at a combined ratio of 99.8% in 2018. With the increase in underwriting profit principally reflecting higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Our insurance and reinsurance other segment reported an underwriting loss of $18 million and a combined ratio of 101.7% in 2019 compared to an underwriting loss of $49 million and a combined ratio of 104.6% in 2018. The decrease in the underwriting loss in 2019 principally reflected higher net favorable prior year reserve development, primarily at Group Re, Fairfax Central and Eastern Europe and Brit Insurance. That was partially offset by a higher current period catastrophe losses, primarily related to the Chilean riots.</p><p>And finally, looking to run off. Excluding the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter 2018 reinsurance transactions, runoff reported an operating loss of $219 million in 2019 compared to an underwriting loss of $288 million in 2018. The decrease in operating loss in 2019, principally reflected the runoff of Advent's unearned premiums and lower loss on claims, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Losses on claims in 2019 reflected net adverse development at U.S. runoff of $216 million, principally related to the strengthening of asbestos, pollution and other latent claim reserves. That was partially offset by European runoff net favorable reserve development of $66 million.</p><p>As Prem noted, on December 20, 2019, the company entered into an agreement to contribute its wholly owned European runoff group to a newly formed RiverStoneBarbados company that will be jointly managed with OMERS. Pursuant to the agreement, OMERS will subscribe for 40% equity interest in RiverStoneBarbados for cash consideration of approximately $600 million. At the closing date, the company will deconsolidate European runoff and remove runoff -- remove from the runoff reporting segment and commence the equity method of accounting to its joint venture interest in the RiverStoneBarbados entity. At December 31, 2019, on our consolidated balance sheet, the assets and liabilities of that European runoff operation were presented as held for sale in the company's balance sheet. And as Prem noted, the transaction is subject to regulatory approval with anticipated closing in the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>Looking to our consolidated results of Fairfax, our consolidated interest and dividend income increased year-over-year from $784 million in 2018 to $880 million in 2019, primarily reflecting higher interest income earned on increased holdings of high-quality U.S. corporate bonds, partially offset by lower interest income earned on decreased holding of our U.S. municipal bonds. Fairfax recorded a provision for income taxes of $262 million at an effective tax rate of 12% in 2019, with the lower effective tax rate in 2019, primarily due to income earned outside of Canada that's taxed at lower rates and the recognition of previously unrecorded U.S. foreign tax credits. Our total debt-to-total-cap ratio, excluding our non-insurance companies, decreased to 24.5% at December 31, 2019, from 25.0% at December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the increase in total capital. We ended 2019 with an investment portfolio, which included the holding company cash and investments of $39 billion, slightly higher than $38.8 billion held at December 31, 2018. Book value per share at December 31, 2019, was $486.10 compared to $432.46 at December 31, 2018, an increase of 14.8% adjusted for that $10 dividend that the company paid in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>And now I'll pass it back over to you, Prem.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Thank you very much, Jen. We look forward to answering your questions. Please give us your name, your company name and try to limit your questions to only one, so that it's fair to everyone on the call. Okay, Annie, we are ready for the questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Jaeme Gloyn from National Bank Financial.</p><p>JAEME GLOYN, ANALYST, NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Premium's growth, obviously, really solid. I was hoping you could break out what organic growth was in Q4?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So organic growth in Q4 was approximately 13% in terms of net written premium. So we're -- basically, Jaeme, we're seeing a rate increase -- accelerated rate increases through 2019. And we've been very careful, and as you know, not writing -- not increasing our premiums over the years in a soft market. In fact, decreasing it. And so now we're expanding. We grew in 2019 and -- on an accelerated basis quarter-by-quarter, that's why I showed it to you, and we think that trend continues in 2020.</p><p>JAEME GLOYN: Okay. And where do you think leverage can reach? And how quickly can Fairfax achieve those levels?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: You mean, in terms of premiums to equity and that type of leverage you're talking about? Yes, so in the past, we've gone to 1.5x net written premiums to shareholders' equity. But our companies, we are very decentralized. So each of our precedence, particularly the big ones, Odyssey, Allied World, Crum &amp; Forster, Brit, they're all ready to expand. They know what to do. It has -- it's not just the price increases, you have to get the right margins because there's also a potential risk with the insurance business, and we have the ability to expand as much as we like in the next few years. And in the past, 2001 -- now this is as a much bigger company today than we were in 2001, but in 2001 after September 11, 2002, '03, and '04, we more than doubled our premium and -- in those 3 years. Now -- right now, we have $17 billion in gross premium, approximately $13 billion in net written premium. But that's how you look at it in total, but what you should look at is each of the companies, $4 billion in Odyssey, approximately $4 billion in Allied and on and on and on. And all of those companies have the ability to expand if the pricing is appropriate. And at the moment, it seems like it's appropriate.</p><p>JAEME GLOYN: Okay, great. And just a follow-up. Can you balance that sort of commentary with shareholding repurchases, given the stock trend and the low book value, it would seem like a decent use of capital to repurchase shares as well. Can you balance those 2 competing uses of capitals?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. Of course, first is to help our companies grow because these opportunities don't last forever. And secondly is to buy back our stock, yes. But we have to do it in a financial way, we have to do it in a way that doesn't put us at risk. And so we -- that's the balance, Jaeme, that we are going through in terms of using on the excess funds that we think we won't need in terms of our expansion potential in the insurance business and buyback our stock. So we bought some and by the way, I've said publicly that we want to buy our shares, we don't want to issue shares, we don't want to expand, we've got a very diversified platform of the insurance, reinsurance business all over the world, but I said that over 10 years. So it's over time, not like every quarter. We'll buy it as and when we feel comfortable to take advantage of it. And -- but we're not going to do it at the expense of our financial position or at the expense of our insurance companies' ability to take advantage of good pricing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>MARK ALAN DWELLE, DIRECTOR OF INSURANCE EQUITY RESEARCH, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of questions. Can you help with -- the holding company cash was about $1.7 billion at the end of last quarter, and it's down to about $1 billion even or so at the end of this quarter. Can you help with just a couple of the major items that accounted for the move from $1.7 billion to about $1 billion?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. Jen?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: So -- right. Sure. So at the end of the last quarter, the $1.7 billion represented, we had $500 million drawn on our credit facility that's been fully repaid in the fourth quarter. There was also some residual capitalization put into our underlying insurance companies to help them with growth.</p><p>MARK ALAN DWELLE: Okay. That's helpful on that. And then...</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: And Mark, as we've said, we get another $600 million in the first quarter as and when this RiverStone U.K. closes. And so we like to build our cash and marketable position to a higher level than $1.1 billion.</p><p>MARK ALAN DWELLE: Okay. That's helpful. The second question, in the -- there was a sizable loss in the fourth quarter related to the profit share in associates and non-insurance entities. Could you talk a little bit about what was there? I'm sure it's probably some type of a mark-to-market, but just to help understand it.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes, for sure, Mark. Jen, would you answer that, please?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: Sure. So Mark, maybe just on that summarized income statement, there will be more details in our MD&amp;A when it comes out in the annual report, to give you more clarity. But high level, I think there's a couple of things to note in that non-insurance companies line. So in there, we have Thomas Cook that you recall is a consolidated investment, but it owns the underlying Quess shares that were demerged in the fourth quarter. Upon that demerger, there was $191 million, but that's an impairment on the Quess shares relating to the noncontrolling interest of Thomas Cook. That full $191 million is attributed to the noncontrolling interest line on the Fairfax net P&amp;L, so 0 impact to our book value per share. It's a growth presentation.</p><p>The other thing to note on that noninsurance operation line is also Fairfax India is presented in that line before we do our consolidation. As Prem noted, that they had an excellent quarter and an uptake, principally related to the Bangalore airport. As a result, they accrue for a performance fee of about $48 million. That's also in that line as an expense. But the way the consolidation works, we have the benefit coming through on the Fairfax line at $48 million. So it's the net benefit that you would actually see in our results of the 66% that we retain. So there is a little bit of noise on kind of a one-off transaction in those lines, just to clarify.</p><p>MARK ALAN DWELLE: No, that's helpful. And then just one last item, if I can. You mentioned within the runoff segment that there were asbestos charges, typically, that's all in the fourth quarter. Could you just quantify how much impact that had on the fourth quarter results?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: You said $216 million, right?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: $216 million.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: $216 million in gross in U.S. asbestos. We had some redundancies in the U.K. and the net impact was $150 million. And of course, Mark, we have interest and dividend income, and you have gains and losses on the stock side, take them all together and approximately, it's about a $50 million loss in our runoff company in -- at a U.S. runoff company, or the total runoff company is about $50 million loss. And so asbestos has been a problem for some time. And the plaintiff's lawyers, this is what they call social inflation, plaintiff's lawyers have been extending their reach into also some nooks and crannies to get anything that's got a little asbestos, as they come after the companies. And we think it might be somewhere here in the next few years might be peaking, but we happen to have the best team in RiverStone, very well versed team for asbestos in environmental settlements. We've made acquisitions on that front also. And so we think we know what we're doing. And we'll grind it to a halt as time goes by. But it is a industry-wide concern as the plaintiff's lawyers extend that reach. They've gone through -- they've been coming after the insurance companies and other companies for decades now. And somewhere here, we think it'll peak out, but it is still something that we watch very carefully and we look at it every year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from the line of Tom MacKinnon from BMO Capital.</p><p>TOM MACKINNON, MD &amp; ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: A question with respect to your minority insurance partners. And they've helped you make acquisitions in the past. And I think the trend has been to sort of help -- to buy them out. But the RiverStone acquisition seems to go a little bit the other way, where you're actually selling some of the stuff back to them. So do you see -- envision an increasing role with these partners going forward? Or do you envision a role where you're going to be buying up your ownership from these partners going forward?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So our -- yes, there are 2 ways -- 2 sides, right, Tom. One is our insurance companies, and we've been buying back our partners' interest over time. So like that would be Brit and that would be Eurolife and that would be Allied. Allied comes this year. So yes, so we'd be looking to eventually own those companies 100%. They are insurance companies and over time, we'd be looking at only 100%. In terms of the RiverStone, we've taken that -- we've taken OMERS as a partner, and we think what we've done is that, as a partner, we've allowed -- that allows us to deconsolidate. And our U.K. company now, RiverStone, can -- there's a lot of Lloyd's companies, and there's a lot of runoffs in the U.K. So it helps us to finance that separately with our partner. And eventually, there's all sorts of possibilities, including taking it public at some point in time. So we're looking at Riverstone U.K. in a separate basis. But it's very much -- it's been a great performer, U.K., and we think the big advantage is it allows us to finance it separately from the Fairfax insurance companies.</p><p>TOM MACKINNON: And what would be the -- in order to take Eurolife and Britain and Allied up to 100% ownership, what's left for you? What kind of cost do you see of that over the next couple years?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So the year Eurolife we'll doing it sometime this year. That we'll probably do it, right, from the company itself. We've done very well in Eurolife. So that won't need much money. And for Brit, we need about 10%, we have to buy back and we're looking at buying back that as soon as we can. And then Allied is -- opens up in June, I think, somewhere June, July, and then we have the ability to do that. I think the -- for Allied, Peter, if I remember, it was something like $1.5 billion, something like that, that we need to buy at some point in time in the next 3, 4 years.</p><p>TOM MACKINNON: Okay. And what about -- and in the Brit, is that -- what's the dollar amount on that?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: The Brit, we don't have to, but it's approximately $100 million, plus/minus $100 million.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from the line of Christopher Gable, an individual investor.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GABLE: I'd like to follow-up a little bit on the rate of share repurchases, which personally had a higher expectation for the rate since I was up there on 10/17, there's about 4% has been purchased back and you mentioned that you're trying to try to reduce it over time from '20 to '23. And today is first time I heard that your time frame is 10 years, I thought it was shorter, but it...</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. We -- I quoted in our annual report, and I quoted and I talked about it in our AGM. The king of buybacks is a guy by the name of Henry Singleton.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GABLE: Know the name.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes, you know the name. But something like 85% of the shares outstanding. But they bought it -- but he bought it over 10, 15 years. And I wanted to make sure that we've got a platform, Christopher, that -- of $17 billion worldwide insurance. And that doesn't include about $2 billion from Eurolife and from Gulf Insurance Co. and some from Digit in India. And so we've got a better part of $20 billion, we don't have to buy anything more. When we grow at 10%, we're growing at $1.7 billion, plus/minus another Brit is how we look at it, right? So we are going to have a tremendous ability going forward when we can balance, as we were saying, our financial position, ability to finance our insurance companies' growth and buyback stock. So over time, we'll be buying back a significant amount of our stock. But we don't want to do it at the expense of our financial position and we don't want to, as I said, do it at the expense of restricting the growth in our insurance companies.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our question is from Mikel Abasolo from Solo Capital Management.</p><p>MIKEL ABASOLO, FOUNDER, SOLO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SL: I have 1 quick specific one and 1 more general, if I may. The specific one has to do with the unrealized gain on Go Digit. I'm surprised by that because in the annual report of 2018, I see that your 45% stake in that company amounts to a total of $3.4 million and the company lost money in the year 2018. So I was curious about that.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So that's a good question. And this is a company that's totally digitized, right? That's all-digital, growing like a weed. In 2 years, Kamesh Goyal, who's the founder of the company, has grown it to $300 million. And more recently, he's been able to raise -- we can only own, at the moment, 49%. He's been able to raise about 10%, a little more than 10%, and a valuation of $800 million plus. And so we might have put, I don't know, $140 million, something like that, $150 million. So that increase for our shares from $800 million plus to what we put is where that $350 million comes from. But Jen, you want to add to that?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: Sure. Maybe just to give you, Mikel, a little bit more color, there's 2 components to that investment that we hold in Digit. So the part that you're referring to is the common stock and a small portion of some pressures that we own. As Prem noted, we're limited to a 49% interest in India. Those shares are at a historic cost was about $16 million currently carried at nil because we do our equity pickup on that basis of the 49%. The large unrealized gain that you've noted of just over $350 million relates to the convertible press shares. So that's where we -- as Prem indicated, they had 3 private equity firms come in and value the company at over $850 million. Our share percentage of that on the convertible press that are a mark-to-market basis is what you're seeing come through on the unrealized gain. It's not the equity-accounted position.</p><p>MIKEL ABASOLO: Right. Excellent. And if I may, I have 1 more general, and I'm coming back with this year after year, almost year after year. And that is I guess that if there is a stockpicker's market, I'm pretty confident that Fairfax will do very well even if the discrepancy or the divergence between growth and value does not close soon enough, but I'm very worried that you confront a general call in the stock markets. You are as aware as I am that the Shiller P/E is at record levels, valuations, any way you look at them, they are extreme. And I mean, my worry is that if there is a general collapse or slow collapse in stock markets, I'm still very confident that Fairfax common stock would do much better than the indices, but I fear that you would be dragged down. And of course, you cannot spend relative dollars.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: No, that's right. And you never know in the stock market, 50% drop, 30% drop, which it could easily do, how we would do? But I do mention to you to look at our 2002, '03 and '04 annual report. In 1999 to 2002, the stock market dropped 50%. This is, of course, the .com bust, but the whole market dropped 50%, and our equity portfolios went up 100%. So there's -- value has been -- had a tough time for years and years and years, perhaps the whole decade. So if some of these high-flying stocks come down, you may not be surprised that the value stocks do well. If history is any guide, that's what's happened before.</p><p>MIKEL ABASOLO: Yes, I'm worried that this time it will be systemic, which it wasn't in 2001, '02, '03.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: And it might well be that. Might will be that. It might well be right on it.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Jeff Fenwick from Cormark Securities.</p><p>JEFFREY MICHAEL FENWICK, MD &amp; HEAD OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH, CORMARK SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So Prem, obviously, to begin, the headlines of late has been the spread of the coronavirus, and I've been getting some questions about that with respect to Fairfax. So can you just frame for us a little bit, maybe the extent of the risk exposure from Fairfax's perspective with respect to things like is this interruption insurance and that type of thing. Is there any sort of commentary you can offer up on that?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So on the insurance side, Jeff, business interruption or anything else would be very minimal yet. Very minimal. We haven't seen any pickup in claims. And we're looking at size, for example, in the past. We don't expect that to be significant, but it could affect some of our investments, business travel might be slow and some other businesses, you hear them all making comments at the -- from the investment side, that might be slower. But from the insurance side, it's that's highly unlikely that will be affected by the coronavirus.</p><p>JEFFREY MICHAEL FENWICK: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just turning to the investment gains. Specific to Q4, fairly sizable equity gain there. Was that the -- did you came with it loaded principally in the fourth quarter?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: That's correct, yes. That was in the fourth quarter.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. Well, that -- yes. Yes. That was exactly right, Jeff.</p><p>JEFFREY MICHAEL FENWICK: Okay. And then maybe just one last one here. I know with the -- part of the market -- pardon me, needs to be associated with some capacity leaving the market, notably from Lloyd's. Do you think that's sustainable? Or as they sort of reorganize there and we see the rates improving, does that capacity start to come back into the market in fairly short order?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Not in short order. It'll come back, but not in short order. And if history is any guide, again, if you see what happened in the past, you get a few years of significant price increases. You had some big companies, like Lloyd's is one, AIG has publicly said they are reducing their capacity significantly, that I think they've dropped it by 75% and a lot of the other large European companies have dropped. The social inflation, there's cat exposure, so these hurricanes that come into Florida, big losses, right, that has taken some time to hit and when it turns, price increases are taking place now. But as you said, Jeff, it'll turn, but you might have a good one for a few years. That's what's happened in the past.</p><p>OPERATOR: It's from [Sardeep Banerjee], a private investor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Congrats on the great result on Fairfax India and Fairfax Financial. So I have a quick question on Bangalore Airport on Fairfax India side. So I don't know if you have already discussed this, but -- so encouraging infrastructure, who did Fairfax serve into? Is it to OMERS? Or did you guys release that information? Or who did...</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: We haven't released that yet. We will release it sometime, but we haven't released it yet. We just said that it was a third-party institutional investor who validated the investment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. But my question is that is the multiple that Fairfax India sold it to -- I mean, to third-party investors, is it a very -- is it a very high, like is it a reach valuation. So my question is coming from that. And can we assume that the future gain would be muted for the Bangalore Airport?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: No. I mean, you should look at it like this. The whole -- we happen to be fortunate about the airport at a valuation, 100%, now I'm talking, at about $1.4 billion. And so the valuation here was about $2.8 billion, less than $3 billion. That's $3 billion for Bangalore International Airport, which is going from 30 million passengers, second terminal, second runway to 45 million, 50 million, 60 million, 70 million and ultimately after 90 million passengers. If you look at Shanghai, it's trading in excess of USD 20 billion. So this is trading at $3 billion, and it's a long ways off from Shanghai, I understand that. But this is a private airport, it's really well run, and it's in the third-largest city in India, as you know, in Bangalore, and there's a ton of software engineers there, almost as many as in Silicon Valley.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes, thanks, Prem. And I can validate that, I've been to the airport and it's really phenomenal. I mean, it's probably the best airport I have been to, except Dubai. Another final question is that Fairfax India share repurchase, right? So if you look at 30th September, the normal course issuer bid cancellation, so as we all know, right, and you already mentioned that Fairfax India share value is undervalued, right? So why then out of $3.5 million that you guys could buy back, only you bought back $1.3 million. Is it an indication of management that is not that undervalued or any comment on that?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: No, no. It's like anything else. We buy as much as we can. And I forget exactly how much we've bought. We've disclosed it, but with a net asset value of close to $17 and stock's trading at $12.5, I don't think you need a lot of work to be done to figure out that it's pretty undervalued. And India is in a tremendous -- with Mr. Modi getting reelected last year, he's got a huge opportunity in the next 5 years.</p><p>So thank you very much for your question. And Annie, thank you very much. I think there is no more questions, Annie. So thank you for joining us all on the call. We look forward to seeing you at our Annual General Meeting, AGM on April 16. We invite you all to come for the meeting, and Paul Rivett will also be there. So we look forward to seeing you all. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: And that concludes today's conference.
