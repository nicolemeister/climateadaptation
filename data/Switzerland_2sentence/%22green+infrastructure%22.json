For the 2025 hurricane season, NOAA forecasts19 to 25 named storms, 7 to 11 hurricanes, and 3 to 6 major hurricanes (Category 3+). Colorado State Universitypredicts a 125% increase in activity over historical averages. Warmer Atlantic sea surface temperatures and climate patterns, specifically the expected transition to neutral ENSO conditionsin August, drive these forecasts.</p><p>Hurricane Trends: Rising Intensity and Risk</p><p>Long-term trends underscore hurricane risks. According to the National Climate Assessment, there has been a measurable increase in the intensity and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes over the past two decades. Rapid intensification events, storms escalating from Category 1 to major hurricane strength within 24 hours, have more than doubled since the 1990s, according to AP News.</p><p>Research from NASAand other climate organizations links warming sea surface temperatures and climate risks to stronger winds, more intense rainfall, higher base sea level, and higher storm surges. While overall storm frequency has held steady, the proportion of major hurricanes (Cat 3+) has steadily increased, according to the EPA.</p><p>Guidewire HazardHub Hurricane Risk Scoresoffer the highest-resolution insights and visibility into hurricane vulnerability. These insights are powering smarter decisions for insurers, communities, and homeowners.</p><p>HazardHub Insights by U.S. Region</p><p>Florida: Epicenter of Hurricane Risk</p><p>* Florida has the highest overall concentration of \"D\" and \"F\" rated properties in the U.S. for hurricane vulnerability, according to the HazardHub Hurricane Risk Score.</p><p>* 3 million homes in Florida are at risk of storm surge flooding.</p><p>* 34% of all housing units in the state are vulnerable to surge flooding. Texas: Under Increased Threat</p><p>* HazardHub identifies Texas as a high-risk state for future hurricane landfalls, with the Houston-Galveston corridor facing particularly elevated exposure.</p><p>* Approximately 5% of homes in Texas are vulnerable to storm surge flooding. Due to the state's large population, this equates to millions of properties and residents at risk. Gulf Coast States: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama</p><p>* Louisiana leads the nation in surge vulnerability, with 52% of homes at risk, approximately 910,000 properties.</p><p>* Mississippi (9% of homes at high risk) and Alabama (3%) also show significant exposure along the coast.</p><p>* These states are frequently affected by both Category 1+ hurricane activity and slow-moving, flood-producing systems. Southeast Corridor: South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina</p><p>* South Carolina: 21% of housing units are at risk of storm surge.</p><p>* Georgia: 4% of homes are at risk, mostly in coastal zones like Savannah.</p><p>* North Carolina: 7% of homes face hurricane-related surge threats and wind damage. Mid-Atlantic &amp; Northeast: Delaware, Virginia, New Jersey, New York</p><p>* Delaware: 20% of homes are exposed to storm surge.</p><p>* Virginia: 13% surge exposure rate. While New York and New Jersey are not among the most exposed states by percentage, HazardHub flags specific coastal regions, including Long Island and the Jersey Shore, as vulnerable to surge flooding and hurricane wind damage in the event of northern-shifting storms.</p><p>Top States for Hurricane Risk</p><p>The top ten states for hurricane risk, based on the percentage of properties rated as \"D\" (high) or \"F\" (very high) risk for hurricane damage in the Guidewire HazardHubHurricane Risk Model, are:</p><p>1. Florida</p><p>2. Louisiana</p><p>3. South Carolina</p><p>4. Texas</p><p>5. Mississippi</p><p>6. North Carolina</p><p>7. Delaware</p><p>8. Georgia</p><p>9. Alabama</p><p>10. Virginia These states face the highest hurricane risk, based on factors such as the likelihood of Category 1 or stronger hurricanes, coastal proximity, and the frequency of tropical and subtropical systems.</p><p>States at Risk of Storm Surge</p><p>The percentage of housing units at risk of storm surge flooding in high-risk hurricane states, based on an 'F' rating in the HazardHub SurgeMax Storm Surge Flooding Model, are:</p><p>* Louisiana - 52%</p><p>* Florida - 34%</p><p>* South Carolina - 21%</p><p>* Delaware - 20%</p><p>* Virginia - 13%</p><p>* Mississippi - 9%</p><p>* North Carolina - 7%</p><p>* Texas - 5%</p><p>* Georgia - 4%</p><p>* Alabama - 3% The HazardHub SurgeMax Score is designed to help assess the risk associated with storm surge events, which can be a significant threat in coastal areas, particularly during severe hurricanes.</p><p>Building Resilience</p><p>While HazardHub highlights where risks are highest, it also empowers proactive resilience. Across the U.S., many high-risk states are taking bold steps to mitigate flood threats-investing in stormwater retention systems, flood barriers, green infrastructure, and voluntary buyout programs. Leading the way are states like Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, Virginia, and New York, each implementing measurable and innovative solutions:</p><p>* Louisiana - Coastal Master Plan: A nationally recognized blueprint that integrates levees, marsh restoration, and storm surge barriers. One standout example is the Barrier Island and Ridge Restorationinitiative, which rebuilds protective natural features using dredged sediment to strengthen defenses against hurricanes and coastal erosion.</p><p>* Florida - Resilient Coastlines Program: Provides grants to support vulnerability assessments and infrastructure adaptation. The Adaptation Planning Grant Programhelps communities design and implement projects such as stormwater management systems and shoreline stabilization to reduce flood risk.</p><p>* South Carolina - Office of Resilience (SCOR): Coordinates statewide efforts to manage floodplains, upgrade infrastructure, and reduce community risk. A key initiative is the Voluntary Buyouts Program, which acquires flood-prone properties and converts them into open green spaces that absorb floodwaters and reduce future losses.</p><p>* New York - NY Rising and Resiliency Institute: Created in response to Hurricane Sandy, this initiative led to citywide zoning reforms that support flood-resilient construction. Notably, new codes enable the elevation of buildings and promote the use of flood-resistant designs in vulnerable coastal zones.

It continues what we started in 2019 and sheds further light on how we are going to execute on our ambition to become net-zero by 2050 across our insurance business, investments and operations, and contribute to the wider society in our role as an insurer.</p><p>The effects of climate change are all around us. The record-breaking heatwaves, floods, droughts and wildfires we have witnessed in recent years are expected to become even more frequent and severe in the next years. These consequences should be addressed by helping society become more resilient while enabling an economy-wide transition to net-zero.</p><p>We are supporting the net-zero transition while helping make society more resilient, so that together, we can build a better future for the next generations.</p><p>Indeed, we are determined to help the society of the future. This means we must act now, because climate risks are becoming too expensive and too painful. We want to provide a solution through what we do best: risk management. Through prevention, resilience and adaptation, we can better manage the physical impacts of climate change and reduce the size and frequency of potential losses, ensuring the world remains insurable.</p><p>This must be a collaborative effort in which all actors play their part. Today, the economy-wide transition is not progressing fast enough to meet the ambition of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in temperatures to 1.5\u00b0?C above pre-industrial levels and to avoid the worst impacts. To change course, we need radical collaboration across and between the public and private sectors.</p><p>Public policy must provide the right frameworks and incentives, but there is also a need for new technology, new solutions and considerable investments.</p><p>Supporting a successful transition offers the prospect of a stronger, more prosperous future that will ultimately benefit our customers, the companies we invest in, and our own business. There will be setbacks and challenges, but the price we pay for inaction is far higher than the price of protection.</p><p>As a global insurer, Zurich will be part of a collaborative solution.

The world must rapidly reach net-zero emissions to avoid the most damaging impacts and simultaneously build greater resilience against the physical hazards which will continue to grow even as we transition. Insurers are fundamental to answering this challenge: as risk managers, helping customers to understand, prevent and reduce climate-related risks; as risk carriers, protecting households, companies and communities by absorbing the financial shocks from increasingly</p><p>Defining net-zero?1</p><p>At a global level, net-zero emissions refer to achieving an overall balance between greenhouse gas emissions produced and taken out of the atmosphere. To limit the average rise in temperature to 1.5\u00b0C, the world must reach net-zero by 2050. This will require deep, rapid and sustained emissions reductions.</p><p>1 Climate Council, 2023: What doesnet-zeroemissions mean?</p><p>extreme weather; and finally, as institutional investors, financing the transition of companies and scaling capital towards climate solutions.</p><p>In 2019, Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich) committed to becoming a net-zero business by 2050 across our insurance, investments and operations. This is our first climate transition plan ('Plan') which outlines how we are executing on this commitment.</p><p>Our Plan prioritizes supporting the transition to a net-zero economy, not just pursuing a net-zero Zurich. We believe this approach is in the best long-term interests of our customers, investee companies and our own business, because achieving net-zero will make the economy more resilient and successful.</p><p>1.2 Dependencies</p><p>Transitioning the entire economy to net-zero will require the efforts of many organizations, across both public and private sectors. Our net-zero ambition and parts of our Plan are dependent on a range of factors which will influence or directly impact our ability to achieve our ambition and to reach our targets in time.</p><p>Some of the most critical factors include the introduction of the right public policy frameworks, the development of new technologies and climate solutions, and how effectively the real-world economy decarbonizes.</p><p>As a result, a significant focus of our Plan is advocating for supportive policies, standards and regulations needed to enable the economy to reach net-zero.</p><p>As the transition progresses, we will continue to iterate our Plan based on the best available data, technologies, science, infrastructure, standards and policy outlooks. This will include looking more systemically at the integration of nature-related risks, opportunities, and nature-based climate solutions into our climate strategy.</p><p>We operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and will adapt and manage the execution of our Plan continuously to ensure it is aligned with such laws and regulations.</p><p>[[&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; CEO      &amp;nbsp; 1.

The insights we gather help inform how we support our customers, our approach to investments, and our understanding of likely decarbonization pathways.</p><p>Our focus is on creating real-world impact, so we prioritize engagement with customers who can make the greatest contribution to emission reductions and where our direct relationship means we have a greater degree of influence.</p><p>Within the next 12 months3, we will engage with</p><p>65 insurance customers on their transition-related objectives, opportunities and challenges. We will continue to expand our engagement efforts, so that by 2030 we will have engaged with 450 of our large</p><p>insurance customers who contribute most heavily to our portfolio emissions.4</p><p>As we engage with our customers on an ongoing basis, we look at their transition plans along four criteria:</p><p>1. Alignment with the Paris Agreement and net-zero targets.</p><p>2. Commitment, including what near-term plans and significant investments are in place.</p><p>3. Delivery, including what progress has been made so far against targets.</p><p>4. Communication, in particular transparent and regular disclosures.</p><p>As we build our understanding of and evaluate our customers' plans, we will prioritize our support and capacity for those customers who are actively transitioning.</p><p>1. From the publication date of this Plan</p><p>2. Determined by scope 1&amp; 2 for our customers' emissions using the PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) insurance associated emissions methodology for commercial lines, covering customers with revenues &gt; USD 1bn</p><p>We engage our investee companies to better understand their climate commitments and transition plans, and to encourage those which have not done so to set and deliver against targets aligned with the Paris Agreement. We believe this is a significantly more effective approach to supporting an economy-wide transition than simply divesting from companies which are carbon-intensive today. As investors, we retain an active dialogue and influence with our investee companies, such as using our voting rights to support their net-zero commitments, which would not be possible if our approach emphasized divestment and exclusions.</p><p>Since 2019, we have engaged with companies representing 60 percent of our investment portfolio emissions. Looking ahead, we will evolve our approach to prioritize bilateral engagements with a select group of companies. Continuing our engagement efforts over the past years, by 2030, we will directly engage with 20 high-emitting companies which currently do not have credible science-based targets. The rationale behind this strategy is to focus our efforts on those companies with the greatest potential to reduce real-world emissions. Where an investee company is also an insurance customer, we coordinate our engagement to maximize our impact.</p><p>Should engagement fail and companies refuse to set targets after due dialogue, Zurich will use its voting rights against board members at shareholder meetings and, ultimately, will divest.</p><p>Our diversified investment approach means Zurich often owns a small stake in individual companies. Therefore, to maximize our impact beyond bilateral engagements, we engage with investee companies through two other routes: we work with initiatives which bring together investors and asset owners to amplify our voice, and we instruct the asset managers who place our funds to consider climate change as part of their mandate and stewardship. We also advocate for public policies and regulations which would support the transition (see section 2.3. for further details).</p><p>[[&amp;nbsp; CEO      1.

In 2023, the combined investment in renewable power and grids overtook the amount spent on fossil fuels for the first time, an unprecedented investment in clean energy infrastructure5. We believe helping meet this accelerated demand through both underwriting and our investments is an important area where Zurich can make a significant contribution to the transition.</p><p>Insuring the transition</p><p>Insuring the development, manufacture, construction, and operation of this vast scale of new projects will be an essential part of the transition to net-zero and presents a significant growth opportunity for our sector. The knock-on effect of USD 2 trillion investments in renewable power generation and distribution grids alone is already expected to increase the size of the construction insurance market by between USD 10?-?30 billion across the U.S., Europe and Asia6. At the same time, renewable energy will make up an ever-larger part of the energy insurance market and is expected to grow from USD 3 billion in 2022 to reach USD 16 billion by 2035?7.</p><p>Keeping pace with the scale of insurance needed for the transition presents its own challenges and will place new pressures on the industry's underwriting capacity. Analysis suggests a significant net expansion of insurance capacity will be needed, particularly through to 2030.8</p><p>[[5       IEA, June 2024, Investment in clean energy this year is set</p><p>&amp;nbsp;  to be twice the amount going to fossil fuels</p><p>]]</p><p>1.

Beyond supporting the development of green infrastructure, we also see growing commercial opportunities in our core underwriting services. Between 2022 and 2023, revenues from environmental solutions more than doubled to reach USD 479 million9. As just one example, in North America a newly approved service contract solution in 2023 for portable electronics gives repair priority over replacement (revenue of USD 131.7 million). In almost all cases the devices are repaired, saving the resources and energy required to produce a replacement.</p><p>Our key levers</p><p>We are focusing on channeling our insurance capacity across all insurance lines, profitably expanding our range of sustainable products and services, and deploying and growing our expertise to support key net-zero technologies and infrastructure in key markets.</p><p>This includes applying our core insurance capabilities to underwrite new infrastructure, as well as developing new insurance solutions for nascent technologies which present new risks and therefore require innovative approaches to insurance. By engaging early, we collect crucial data to identify and mitigate technological risks, thus improving the insurability and access to finance for these innovations. This proactive approach helps accelerate the commercialization of emerging sustainable energy technologies.</p><p>The transition will happen faster in some sectors than others. The heaviest emitting sectors face the most difficult and longest journey ahead and will require technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, that have not yet achieved commercial scale.</p><p>9Zurich Sustainability report (SR) 2023, pages 182 - 184</p><p>[[&amp;nbsp;  CEO       1.
