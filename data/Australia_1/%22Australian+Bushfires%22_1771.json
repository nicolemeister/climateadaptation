But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election.

But when it comes to his own children, surely Rupert Murdoch has a limit to abusing his power and stripping their privileges.  After copping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-murdoch-loses-family-trust-case-nevada/\">a 93-page shellacking</url> from Nevada probate commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch should give this scandalous family control grab a rest and instead embrace the peace sentiment from James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who jointly said yesterday they hope they can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members\u201d.   And what does Rupert\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/12/10/rupert-murdoch-project-harmony-case-lachlan-james-prudence-elisabeth/\">big-noting celebrity lawyer</url> Adam Streisand do in response? He immediately declares a plan to appeal. Talk about tone-deaf. It's fair to say that James Murdoch, who turns 51 on Friday, won\u2019t be getting any birthday wishes from father Rupert and older brother Lachlan, who reportedly spent some time together in Australia.  Lachlan appears obsessed with James and prepared to do almost anything to keep him at bay. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New York Times</emphasis> reporting of the judgment reveals, it was Lachlan\u2019s idea to ask Rupert to make the outrageous unilateral change to the family trust \u2014 which would have given permanent control of the conservative media empire comprising Fox and News Corporations to Lachlan after Rupert dies \u2014 with just a day\u2019s notice before an emergency trust meeting in London.  The probate commissioner, however, found that the three legally victorious adult children did not share \u201cany singleness of purpose in changing the management of Fox News\u201d and actually \u201cdisavowed any plan to oust their brother\u201d, ruling against Rupert and Lachland's plan. As such, it would be extraordinary of Rupert to soldier on with Lachlan\u2019s paranoid schemes.   What sort of father summons his two adult daughters to an emergency family trust meeting in London and gives them virtually no notice of his plan to remove their equal voting rights, negotiated over many months during his divorce proceedings with second wife Anna Murdoch almost two decades earlier? The optics of a 93-year-old man on his fifth marriage refusing to trust his two adult daughters to manage long-standing tensions between Lachlan and James says a lot about the patriarch\u2019s misogyny.   Surely it is time for a negotiated family settlement by agreement, not judicial decree. For instance, why is Lachlan the only family member entitled to serve as a director of the two public companies at the heart of the family\u2019s media power, Fox Corp and News Corp? Were the other three adult children even consulted when Lachlan and Rupert decided to replace the retiring former Ford CEO and BHP chairman Jac Nasser <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/09/25/tony-abbott-fox-board-grievance-and-division/\">with Tony Abbott</url> on the Fox Corp board last year? This first executive move \u2014 made after Rupert\u2019s retirement from both boards was announced in September last year \u2014 sent a clear message about the muscular right-wing path Lachlan wanted to take.  It was always going to be difficult for Rupert to prove in court that his heirs would face disaster unless Lachlan was given complete control. How could he prove that James, Prudence and Elisabeth would blow up the Fox News right-wing business model, particularly given Lachlan\u2019s record is nothing to write home about? At his first AGM run as solo chair of News Corp last month, Lachlan attracted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">second-largest protest vote</url> of the six directors up for election. A day earlier at Fox Corp\u2019s AGM, he was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">second-most opposed</url> of their seven directors.  Indeed, if you strip out the 103.5 million shares or 44% voting stake that Rupert Murdoch personally controls in Fox Corp, Lachlan's recent reelection as executive chair was only carried with 78.2 million votes in favour and a hefty <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/656ae3d3-3404-40fb-9d4d-f45213c0ba82\">28.4 million against</url>. It was an even more pronounced protest at News Corp, where a <url normalizedValue=\"https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20241122/pdf/06bq0zkxnbjf96.pdf\">clear majority</url> of the independent shareholders supported an activist resolution to unwind the company\u2019s undemocratic capital structure that has entrenched the Murdoch family\u2019s voting control.  The visible war between Lachlan and James has been running since the summer of 2019-20 when James went public about News Corp\u2019s climate denialist coverage of the devastating Australian bushfires and then later quit the News Corp board altogether. Even since, he\u2019s been playing with Lachlan\u2019s mind, with multiple media reports suggesting that his three adult siblings will move against him once Rupert passes.  This latest setback is not the first time Rupert and Lachlan\u2019s long-term power management plans have been foiled. In October 2022, they proposed a merger between News Corp and Fox Corp, but it was withdrawn in January 2023, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fox-news-corp-deal-merger-murdoch-1235309361/\">reportedly</url> after James sent letters to both boards objecting.  Rupert reportedly said the following at that fateful London trust meeting last year: \u201cI love each of my children, and my support of Lachlan is not intended to suggest otherwise. But these companies need a designated leader and Lachlan is that leader.\u201d This is rubbish, particularly given the governance and management challenge of leading two separate, enormous public companies.  From a one-man-control perspective, if the News Corp and Fox Corp merger had gone through, it would have been easier for Lachlan to manage the combined empire as executive chair. Instead, since Rupert\u2019s retirement as co-chair of both boards last November, Lachlan has stepped up to head both, a clear leadership overreach, particularly for someone who insists on living in Sydney and working remotely through the night.  If it was just about money, a settlement could involve a carve-up of the assets with the dissidents receiving certain assets in exchange for cancelling their subtrust entitlements. However, given the global notoriety of Fox News and its coming peak power during the second Trump presidency, some observers believe the more progressive adult children are more interested in selling the cash machine and removing the long-term stain on the family\u2019s reputation, rather than managing it more moderately.  Fox News is easily the most lucrative part of the Murdoch empire, and it's the only thing apart from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Australian</emphasis> that Rupert started from scratch and controls to this day. Selling it would be a wrench, but if someone like Elon Musk was prepared to pay $20 billion-plus for it, bringing an end to the family wars, then why not? If Rupert was prepared to sell 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 and is trying to sell Foxtel now, then don\u2019t be surprised if a potential sale of Fox News before Rupert\u2019s death comes into play.  However, with Rupert seemingly in good health, the other tactic could be to simply abandon the appeal plans, apologise to the kids and hope that a few more years with Lachlan and Rupert in control would repair the rift. After all, News Corp shares hit a record high this month, and with Fox News ratings and profits also hitting new levels, the family empire has arguably never been in ruder financial health.

Although she's always imagined herself having children, she's now adamant that she doesn't want to bring a child into a world filled with uncertainty and environmental decline.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then there's the 25-year-old builder, distressed and heartbroken, whose long-term partner just ended their relationship because they couldn't agree on having children. She was undecided, torn by the challenges of the future, while he desperately wanted a family.</p><p>Or the 21-year-old law student who, during a routine discussion about birth control, casually mentioned that she's decided not to have children at all, citing the rising cost of living, housing insecurity, and what troubles me most - a deep-seated fear for the future rooted in the state of our environment.</p><p>This fear is not irrational. We live in a world where fossil fuel production is contributing to a growing burden of disease.</p><p>The situation is urgent. Health groups have long warned that fossil fuels are not just an environmental threat-they are a direct threat to human health. A new report by the medical advocacy group Doctors for the Environment Australia (DEA) highlights the peril that we face from the continued burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>The consequences of our reliance on fossil fuels are staggering.</p><p>Microplastics - a byproduct of fossil fuels - are found everywhere, including in the human body. They have been detected in the blood, organs such as liver and kidneys, as well as in the placenta and in the cord blood of newborns. Plastics are contributing to male infertility, premature births, and cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Burning coal, oil and gas causes dangerous air pollution, including fine particles (PM2.5). These harmful particles can cross from our lungs into our bloodstream and from there throughout all body organs, including our hearts, brains and reproductive systems. Pollution is a major contributor to heart disease, stroke, cancer, and poor pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>The combustion of fossil fuels also increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in the trapping of heat and warming of our planet. As we edge closer to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures, we see the severity of disasters like bushfires, floods, and storms escalating. These events disproportionately impact pregnant women, their unborn babies, and infants.</p><p>A recent study published in the authoritative Lancet Planetary Health underscores the dangers: pregnant women exposed to disasters like floods face heightened risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and long-term health complications. Stress, physical strain, and limited access to healthcare during these events compound these risks, leading to outcomes that can affect future generations.</p><p>In my own collaborative research on the 2019-20 Australian bushfires, we found that caregivers faced severe challenges due to inadequate planning and support. Delayed evacuations and unsafe conditions in evacuation centres left lasting impacts on their health and recovery.</p><p>READ MORE:</p><p>Will a falling population be better for the environment? OK, Millennial, have you really stopped your whining? The landscape has changed and we could sleepwalk into war without knowing Similarly, research following the Northern Rivers flood of 2022 revealed the dire conditions women and children faced in evacuation centres, where unmanaged risks created unsafe environments, leading to gender-based violence and a lack of access to essential services like contraception and abortion.</p><p>As health professionals, we have a duty to call out when health is severely threatened and to find ways to act. Now is the time to tell our government that the health harms of fossil fuels must be addressed with the same urgency as those of tobacco, alcohol, and gambling.</p><p>A shift from hazardous fossil fuels to clean energy such as solar and wind needs to be a key priority. This isn't just a moral obligation to the next generation - it's a matter of their survival.</p><p>Dr Michelle Hamrosi is a general practitioner in NSW.

Although she's always imagined herself having children, she's now adamant that she doesn't want to bring a child into a world filled with uncertainty and environmental decline.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then there's the 25-year-old builder, distressed and heartbroken, whose long-term partner just ended their relationship because they couldn't agree on having children. She was undecided, torn by the challenges of the future, while he desperately wanted a family.</p><p>Or the 21-year-old law student who, during a routine discussion about birth control, casually mentioned that she's decided not to have children at all, citing the rising cost of living, housing insecurity, and what troubles me most - a deep-seated fear for the future rooted in the state of our environment.</p><p>This fear is not irrational. We live in a world where fossil fuel production is contributing to a growing burden of disease.</p><p>The situation is urgent. Health groups have long warned that fossil fuels are not just an environmental threat-they are a direct threat to human health. A new report by the medical advocacy group Doctors for the Environment Australia (DEA) highlights the peril that we face from the continued burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>The consequences of our reliance on fossil fuels are staggering.</p><p>Microplastics - a byproduct of fossil fuels - are found everywhere, including in the human body. They have been detected in the blood, organs such as liver and kidneys, as well as in the placenta and in the cord blood of newborns. Plastics are contributing to male infertility, premature births, and cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Burning coal, oil and gas causes dangerous air pollution, including fine particles (PM2.5). These harmful particles can cross from our lungs into our bloodstream and from there throughout all body organs, including our hearts, brains and reproductive systems. Pollution is a major contributor to heart disease, stroke, cancer, and poor pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>The combustion of fossil fuels also increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in the trapping of heat and warming of our planet. As we edge closer to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures, we see the severity of disasters like bushfires, floods, and storms escalating. These events disproportionately impact pregnant women, their unborn babies, and infants.</p><p>A recent study published in the authoritative Lancet Planetary Health underscores the dangers: pregnant women exposed to disasters like floods face heightened risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and long-term health complications. Stress, physical strain, and limited access to healthcare during these events compound these risks, leading to outcomes that can affect future generations.</p><p>In my own collaborative research on the 2019-20 Australian bushfires, we found that caregivers faced severe challenges due to inadequate planning and support. Delayed evacuations and unsafe conditions in evacuation centres left lasting impacts on their health and recovery.</p><p>Similarly, research following the Northern Rivers flood of 2022 revealed the dire conditions women and children faced in evacuation centres, where unmanaged risks created unsafe environments, leading to gender-based violence and a lack of access to essential services like contraception and abortion.</p><p>As health professionals, we have a duty to call out when health is severely threatened and to find ways to act. Now is the time to tell our government that the health harms of fossil fuels must be addressed with the same urgency as those of tobacco, alcohol, and gambling.</p><p>A shift from hazardous fossil fuels to clean energy such as solar and wind needs to be a key priority. This isn't just a moral obligation to the next generation - it's a matter of their survival.</p><p>Dr Michelle Hamrosi is a general practitioner in NSW.

an energy-efficient early fire smoke detection system.</p><p>It is estimated the remote sensing method could detect fires 500 times faster than traditional on-ground processing of imagery.</p><p>The Kanyini mission is a collaboration between the SA government, SmartSat CRC and industry partners to launch a 6 U CubeSat satellite into low Earth orbit to detect bushfires as well as monitor inland and coastal water quality.</p><p>Equipped with a hyperspectral imager, the satellite sensor captures reflected light from Earth in different wavelengths to generate detailed surface maps for various applications, including bushfire monitoring, water quality assessment and land management.</p><p>Lead researcher UniSA geospatial scientist Stefan Peters said Earth observation satellites had traditionally not had the onboard processing capabilities to analyse complex images of Earth captured from space in real-time.</p><p>His team, which includes scientists from UniSA, Swinburne University of Technology and Geoscience Australia, has overcome this by building a lightweight AI model that can detect smoke within the available onboard processing, power consumption and data storage constraints of cube satellites.</p><p>\"Smoke is usually the first thing you can see from space before the fire gets hot and big enough for sensors to identify it, so early detection is crucial,\" Dr Peters said.</p><p>To demonstrate the AI model, they used simulated satellite imagery of recent Australian bushfires, using machine learning to train the model to detect smoke in an image.</p><p>Using a past fire event in the Coorong as a case study, the simulated Kanyini AI onboard approach took less than 14 minutes to detect the smoke and send the data to the South Pole ground station.</p><p>\"This research shows there are significant benefits of onboard AI compared to traditional on ground processing,\" Dr Peters said.</p><p>\"This will not only prove invaluable in the event of bushfires but also serve as an early warning system for other natural disasters.\"</p><p>The research team hopes to demonstrate the onboard AI fire detection system in orbit in 2025 when the Kanyini mission is operational.</p><p>\"Once we have ironed out any issues, we hope to commercialise the technology and employ it on a CubeSat constellation, aiming to contribute to early fire

But as our <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.17283\">research</url> shows, a series of unusual events in recent years caused ozone holes that lasted longer. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol\">Montreal Protocol</url>, which came into force just four years after the ozone hole was discovered in 1985, has been enormously successful in preventing many ozone-depleting gases from entering the atmosphere. </p><p>But the hole will continue to open each year for at least another <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/01/1132277\">four decades</url> because of the long lifetimes of gases emitted last century.</p><p>Ozone depletion is also linked with climate change, and there are other emerging issues which could affect ozone recovery. These include <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/bushfire-smoke-eats-up-the-ozone-protecting-us-from-dangerous-radiation-the-damage-will-increase-as-the-world-heats-up-201375\">more frequent mega-wildfires due to climate change</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/a-rapidly-growing-rocket-industry-could-undo-decades-of-work-to-save-the-ozone-layer-unless-we-act-now-198982\">emissions from rocket launches</url> and more satellite debris burning up in the upper atmosphere. </p><p>All this indicates ozone depletion is <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43630-024-00577-8\">far from a solved problem</url>. </p><h>Why ozone matters</h><p>Most atmospheric ozone resides in the stratosphere, at around 10-50km above Earth's surface, where it absorbs the sun's ultraviolet-B rays. </p><p>In New Zealand and Australia, summertime <url normalizedValue=\"https://uv.substack.com/p/global-patterns-in-uv\">peak UV levels</url> are higher - sometimes by as much as 30% - than at comparable latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. </p><p>This is due to lower levels of air pollution, slightly <url normalizedValue=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002JD002770\">lower ozone amounts historically</url> and proximity to the sun, which is closer during Southern Hemisphere summers.</p><p>New Zealand and Australia also have the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ozone.unep.org/system/files/documents/EEAP-assessment-report-2022-QA.pdf\">highest melanoma rates in the world</url>. This is partly because of the higher UV levels, but there are other contributing factors, including improved diagnosis due to increased awareness. </p><p>If the Montreal Protocol had not been implemented, melanoma rates would be significantly higher today. </p><h>How the ozone hole contributes to climate change</h><p>Even though most ozone-depleting gases are now banned, it will take decades before they are gone from the stratosphere. </p><p>In the meantime, the ozone hole continues to form above <url normalizedValue=\"https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Antarctica each spring</url>, causing <url normalizedValue=\"https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.652\">cascading changes</url> in temperature, winds and rainfall patterns across the Southern Hemisphere. </p><p>Ozone depletion causes the prevailing westerly winds at southern mid-latitudes (the \"Roaring Forties\") to strengthen and shift toward Antarctica during summertime. This has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/chapter-3-2/\">increased surface melting on Antarctic ice shelves</url> and is changing summertime rainfall and temperature patterns in New Zealand and Australia.</p><p>While the ozone hole drives climate change, protection and recovery of the ozone layer has additional benefits for the climate. </p><p>Many ozone-depleting gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are also potent greenhouse gases. By phasing out these gases, the Montreal Protocol has helped the world avoid a catastrophic collapse of the global ozone layer, and also limited global warming. </p><p>One study estimated the Montreal Protocol delayed the first ice-free summer in the Arctic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2211432120\">by up to 15 years</url>.</p><p>Ozone depletion and climate change are interlinked issues. While ozone depletion affects Southern Hemisphere climate, global ozone recovery is in turn affected by emissions of dominant greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane. </p><h>Technological innovations bring new threats</h><p>The discovery of the ozone hole in 1985 was a major surprise. While the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/249810a0\">alarm bells</url> had been sounded in the 1970's that CFCs destroy stratospheric ozone, scientists didn't predict the existence of the large hole above Antarctica. </p><p>It was some years after the ozone hole was discovered that scientists began to understand just how ozone depletion works in the cold Antarctic stratosphere.</p><p>The Montreal Protocol is arguably the most successful environmental treaty, but the ozone story brings continual surprises. The timing of ozone recovery depends in part on future emissions but there are other contributing factors.</p><p>Recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05683-0\">research shows</url> mega-wildfires such as the Australian bushfires of 2019 can contribute to ozone depletion.

His poetry is sublime. This is a collection of short stories, beautifully packaged by Transit Lounge. Kinsella is deeply concerned about the environment. His language, when he talks about our fragile planet, is like music. I have not yet read all the stories in this collection - I intend to savour them, one at a time - but he sure knows how to get you in, with elevator pitches like these: \"Two men must awkwardly meet again when their daughters -attend the same ballet class\". Bravo John. I'm so happy to have this in my to-be-read pile.</p><p>FIREWORKS By Oliver Smuhar Mountain Blue Publishing, Children 274pp, $7 This book was truly a labor of love for the author, who is also the illustrator. In his letter to readers, Oliver says: \"First of all, I would like to thank you for your donation!\" Because some of the money raised is going to the FireWorks fund for the environment. Oliver is a young and passionate writer, who published his first book, a young adult fantasy, before he'd even finished high school. He says: \"From the bottom of my heart, I hope you enjoy what I've created\", which is a lovely story about Illuka the koala and Bouddi the sugar glider, who had to try to survive Australian bushfires.</p><p>BOY WITH A BLACK ROOSTER By Stefanie vor Schulte (translated by Alexandra Roesch) New South, Fairytale 184pp, $29.99 This little book is described as a \"fairy tale for adults\". It was originally published in German but is now available in English, and it has won a number of different prizes, among them the Mara Cassens Prize for best German-language debut. It was also nominated for the Klaus-Michael Kuhne Prize. The premise is fascinating: can an 11-year-old boy succeed where others have failed, and recover a kidnapped child? The boy in question is accompanied at all times by his friend, the black rooster. You'll cheer for him, as he goes about his adventures. It's a morality tale, by and large.</p><p>THE OUTSIDE By Larry Blair and Jeremy Goring Penguin Random House, Nonfiction 305pp, $29.99 This book has got a little of the Trent Daltons about it, except that Larry Blair has decided not to fictionalise his life story but to tell it with a friend. According to the blurb, he \"shot to fame at just 19, coming from nowhere to take the largest ever cash prize in surfing\". He's also won Hawaii's Pipeline Masters, twice. Nobody knew how far he'd come: his father, Baldy Blair, was a bank robber, and his mother, -Patricia, a jewel thief. Larry's co-writer is also his long-time surfing partner. The ocean shimmers, a symbol of peace throughout.</p><p>SHAKESPEARE IS HARD BUT SO IS LIFE By Fintan O'Toole Head of Zeus, Nonfiction 196pp, $29.99 This is a hard copy, issued by Bloomsbury for the Australian market, and if you're at all interested in Shakespeare - I mean, who isn't? - you need this on your shelves. Fintan O'Toole is a columnist for the Irish Times, and an editor at the New York Review of Books. He is a warm, funny guide to the Bard, but he's also keen to pick apart the idea that Shakespeare essentially writes morality plays, saying: \"We are not in a moral universe of comeuppances and rewarded virtue.\"</p><p>BENEATH THE SOUTHERN CROSS: LOOKING FOR AUSTRALIA IN THE 21ST CENTURY Edited by Peter Kurti Connor Court, Essays 230pp, $29.95 This is a new collection of essays from writers and academics who take, as a jumping off point, the idea that the voice referendum exposed some divisions in the Australian community, which perhaps reflect deeper changes in our culture. The foreword, by Lorraine Finlay, sets the scene: \"What does it mean to be Australian? There is no single, objectively correct answer to this question.\" Yet it's absolutely critical for any nation to have something of a national story, and a sense of pride in that story. To that end, the writers are keen to \"restore cultural self-confidence, and recover a truly national identity\". The contributors include Georgina Downer, Anne Henderson, Gary Johns and Tanveer Ahmed.</p><p>JOHN BERGER AND ME By Nikos Papastergiadis Giramondo, Memoir 212pp, $32.95 Studies of male friendship are rarer these days than they used to be, which is why I was so pleased to see this elegant volume, when it first crossed my desk. The author is a sociologist, who studied at the University of Melbourne and the University of Cambridge; he is now a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. He recalls and examines in this book his long friendship with writer and art critic, the late John Berger, with whom he lived a peasant life over many summer months, including during the harvest in a French village. The author says: \"This book is about how he (Berger) changed my appreciation of my -father's peasant life (in Greece) and how his memory continues to shape my life.\" Lovely.</p><p>HEIMLICH UNHEIMLICH By Hazel Smith and Sieglinde Karl-Spence Apothecary Archive, History 53pp, $22 This is an important book. It takes the contrasting childhoods of the two author-illustrators as a starting point. They have also made use of glorious photographs from their family albums. The characters are Hessian, a German girl whose father fought in the German army, who migrates to Australia while she is still a child; and Muslin, who was born to a Jewish family in England after the war, before becoming a poet, and moving to Australia. Her family is keen to preserve Jewish culture, and cannot forgive the Nazis. Second and even third-generation trauma is still being unpicked by sociologists, and this is a -wonderful contribution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-8b31b598546911efbcf6ec30b1deccd8d2e18aa42090ae53452b96cbaa7afcf7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CRD-7181-JD3N-53MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Review Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 17, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000CY63</classCode><className>BEAM GLOBAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4931 ELECTRIC &amp; OTHER SERVICES COMBINED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>BEEM (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UTI</classCode><className>FANTASY LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UCO</classCode><className>POETRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DIF5</classCode><className>ADULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009UWW</classCode><className>YOUNG ADULT LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX000150</classCode><className>AWARDS &amp; PRIZES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST0009X2F</classCode><className>BALLET</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N511130CC</classCode><className>BOOK PUBLISHING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>GS127</classCode><className>HAWAII, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Trees shrink to shrubs extending in all directions until you reach the waters' edge.</p><p>Standing beside Sanamere Lagoon, it's quiet \u2014 eerily so. A local legend claims the lagoon is haunted, and with no sign of fish in the water, nor birds calling, it's easy to believe.</p><p>There aren't many animals here because the soil contains so few nutrients. The shrubby heath around the lagoon includes little pitcher plants that supplement their diet with insects.</p><p>But while the area may be poor in nutrients, it's rich in information. This lagoon has been quietly recording environmental changes for around 20,000 years.</p><p>A couple hundred kilometres south is another natural archive dubbed Big Willum Swamp.</p><p>It's not as vast as Sanamere \u2014 around a 20th the size \u2014 and it sits in a protective bubble of eucalypt woodland smack bang in the middle of an active bauxite mine.</p><p>Big Willum is 3.5 metres deep in the dry season, but dark watermarks across the surrounding trees, around the height of my head, show this swamp can expand significantly in wetter months.</p><p>There is more life at Big Willum Swamp than Sanamere. Lilies float on the water's surface and birds sing from the trees. The Peppan Traditional Owners welcome us to the site, and join us on the water.</p><p>At Sanamere and Big Willum, we paddle out as close to the middle of the water as possible to extract sediment cores.</p><p>This basically involves pushing a circular or D-shaped tube into the mud, either by hand or with the help of a hydraulic corer mounted on a raft, and pulling up a long, thin column comprising layers of mud.</p><p>These cores, collected in 2016 and 2017 respectively, take us back 8,000 years at Sanamere and 3,000 at Big Willum.</p><h>The hunt for ancient fires</h><p>With cores collected, the analysis begins.</p><p>The cores are sliced thinly and a few chosen slivers of sediment are analysed to calculate their age.</p><p>If a slice contains loads of charcoal, that's a good sign that a lot of vegetation burned during that period.</p><p>The particles can be tiny. The smallest fragments of charcoal look like black dust.</p><p>It's only when you turn to the microscope that you can appreciate what you're seeing.</p><p>Bubblewrap, blocky, mesh, sponge-like; these are some of the many shapes and structures I see in these tiny black specks.</p><p>The largest particles (around 2 to 0.25 millimetres across) show the most detail, but even some of the smallest have structure to them.</p><p>Spending hours at a microscope isn't the only way to look at signs of ancient fire from soil.</p><p>We can use a chemical technique to separate and measure different types or isotopes of carbon, which tells us how much charcoal from these sites came from burnt grasses or trees and shrubs.</p><p>Charcoal that has been counted under a microscope can include particles burned at a whole range of intensities.</p><p>In contrast, the chemical method isolates charcoal produced by high-intensity fires. This is called pyrogenic carbon.</p><p>If a slice of sediment core contains more pyrogenic carbon as a proportion of total charcoal, that tells us high-intensity or hot fires dominated the environment at that time.</p><p>Why do we look at fire intensity? Put simply, it's something humans can influence.</p><p>Indigenous cultural burning is usually done in patches as a \"mosaic\" of low-intensity burns lit at different times suited to the plants of a region.</p><p>Historically, <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2002.00677.x\">cultural burning across northern Australia took place year-round</url>. Careful, region-specific management meant fires could be lit in hotter, drier months without becoming destructive, thanks to the patches burnt earlier.</p><h>Then and now</h><p>While we can't pick out individual fires to analyse (for most lakes we can't even pick out individual years), we can look at how fire intensity changes throughout time.</p><p>So how do fires over the past century stack up against the thousands of years before?</p><p>The Sanamere mud core shows the amount and intensity of fires stayed fairly steady between 5,000 and 8,000 years ago.</p><p>But the core taken from Big Willum reveals that the past 50 to 100 years have not been business as usual.</p><p>At Big Willum Swamp, high-intensity or hot fires increased significantly over the past century, compared to low levels sustained throughout the rest of the 3,000-year mud core record.</p><p>This is, of course, just one part of Australia.

The next day, the spotter aircraft reported 26 smokes within the forests south-east of Perth. The Incident controller plotted the location of these fires onto his fuel-age plans and was relieved to find that, of the 26 fires, 20 were burning in fuels that were less than four years old, so could initially be left unattended. He then concentrated all fire-fighting efforts on the six fires burning in heavier fuels. These were brought under control, with a total of only 6000 hectares of forest burnt.</p><p>This is another, of the many examples, where fuel reduction by prescribed fire has been successful in avoiding potential catastrophe.

Ann Kaplan famously described mothers in cinema as \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315001999/motherhood-representation-ann-kaplan\">an absent presence</url>\" - background figures that might facilitate the narrative but who are rarely, if ever, its focus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am palpably reminded of this watching the opening scenes of Mahalia Belo's assured debut feature film The End We Start From. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Skilfully adapted by Alice Birch from Megan Hunter's 2017 novella, the film opens in the bathroom of a London townhouse. </p><p>The headless torso of the heavily pregnant unnamed woman (the excellent Jodie Comer) potters in the background, chattering to her off-screen partner (Joel Fry). Steam from a running bath slowly clouds the camera lens. The sounds of rushing water drown the woman out until she is silenced.</p><p>The End We Start From is an ecological disaster story set in a near-future London besieged by floods, so it is unsurprising the film opens with this watery submersion. </p><p>Nonetheless, it is hard not to read the scene as a nod to the long cinematic history of erasing mothers. Belo sets this tradition up only to tear it back down in her insistence on viewing the cataclysmic events through the eyes of a new mother.</p><h>Motherhood as catastrophe</h><p>Centring a survival story on a new mother has its roots in mainstream portrayals of motherhood as difficult and depleting. </p><p>Popular culture is rife with discussions of mothers who feel they have \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://kateborsato.com/featured/losing-identity-as-a-mom/\">lost themselves</url>\" in their new maternal role. </p><p>The film begins dramatically, pairing the breaking of the woman's waters with the heavy deluge pounding London. The sequence crosscuts between closeups of Comer's face and disorientating angles of rising water levels, reaching a crescendo as the baby's head crowns at the exact moment flood waters erupt through the windows and doors of the couple's home.</p><p>Despite the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21810682/faq/\">small budget</url> and limited special effects, the moment packs a wallop. In pairing motherhood with mother nature, the film depicts birth as both a beginning and an end, a seismic event that, however ordinary, feels biblical in scale.</p><p>Reproduction has <url normalizedValue=\"https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/64058\">long featured in dystopian texts</url> as a metaphor for exploring anxieties around technological interventions, threats to human agency, and the creeping eradication of personal freedoms.  </p><p>But mothers themselves have been demonstrably absent. </p><p>Frequently dead, appearing only in memories and dreams as per Cormac McCarthy's apocalyptic novel The Road (2006) or even Margaret Atwood's feminist dystopia The Handmaid's Tale (1985), critics have argued mothers in speculative fiction are little more than \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://intellectusspeculativus.wordpress.com/2018/12/03/aliette-de-bodard-on-motherhood-and-erasure/\">empty spaces or hollowed out characters</url>\".</p><p>In a reversal of this trope, the absent father-figure haunts The End We Start From, seen only in flickering glimpses by the mother at the centre.</p><p>The film is part of a growing dystopian subgenre of \"maternal cli-fi\" seeking to upend this tradition of absent mothers. Other examples include Clare Moleta's novel Unsheltered (2021), Diane Cook's novel The New Wilderness (2020), and the Australian TV series The Commons (2019).</p><p>These works depict characters navigating worlds ravaged by climate change and environmental disaster. Not surprisingly, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/26/stories-to-save-the-world-the-new-wave-of-climate-fiction\">climate fiction</url> has experienced a surge in popularity as events like the 2022 Auckland floods and Australian bushfires render the seemingly unimaginable frighteningly real.</p><p>What distinguishes maternal cli-fi from climate fiction more broadly is its use of motherhood as a narrative strategy to raise ethical questions about the future of the world and our place in it.</p><h>Is it OK to still have children?</h><p>In the face of profound environmental precarity and an uncertain global future, many women are questioning whether or not to have children at all. </p><p>Up to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/2021-deloitte-global-millennial-survey-report.pdf\">60% of millennial and gen Z women</url> cite global warming as a key factor when considering parenthood, while <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.acf.org.au/women_will_change_their_lives_and_votes_for_climate_action\">one in three Australian women under the age 30</url> say they are reconsidering having (more) children due to climate anxiety. </p><p>Maternal cli-fi takes these fears seriously, personalising the global and bringing the world's crises closer to home. </p><p>As many modern mothers will attest, motherhood lends itself well to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221111-what-is-maternal-ambivalence-and-why-it-matters\">ambivalence and uncertainty</url>, often manifesting in guilt, doubt and second-guessing.</p><p>Although tempting to dismiss maternal cli-fi as depressing and grim, The End We Start From also finds pleasure in unexpected places. Scenes between mother and infant are intimate and bodily, bathed in chiaroscuro lighting to create an embryonic cocoon at odds with the environmentally ravaged society-on-the-brink. </p><p>Further reprieve from the simmering violence comes via the woman's burgeoning friendship with another new mum (an effervescent Katherine Waterston), providing solace and support.</p><p>The End We Start From does not answer whether we should continue to have children in a world where our future is anything but guaranteed. </p><p>Instead, this tender, fierce film seeks to excavate the mother from her place of erasure and remind us of the ethical potential of the maternal point of view. </p><p>Belo has described how motherhood prompted her to view \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressreader.com/uk/cambridge-news/20240126/281719799458161\">the world slightly differently</url>\" - a perspective maternal cli-fi implores us to share.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The End We Start From is now streaming on Apple TV.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Williamson does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAUS-232475</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAUS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8V-3T91-DXP7-11MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><timeReceived>2:03 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Australia</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6070\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 18, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp;

New research has found recent bushfires and volcanic eruptions have caused ozone holes to extend over the continent from spring into summer. And it's the swift reduction of carbon emissions that will give the ozone layer the chance to recover. Rachel Hayter reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> After a long winter at sea, animals return to Antarctica in summer and the icy continent bursts into life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharon Robinson:</emphasis> The penguins will all come up onto the beaches and lay their eggs and rear their chicks and the seals also will be having their pups up on the sea ice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> Professor Sharon Robinson from the University of Wollongong is a climate change biologist.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharon Robinson:</emphasis> In the summer when you go down there, there's usually loads of penguins nesting and rearing their chicks and it's very noisy and very exciting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> She's been working with the Australian Antarctic Division at Casey Station which has some of the best moss beds in all of Antarctica.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharon Robinson:</emphasis> In the summer the ice melts and whole areas just become really green. You go down to Antarctica expecting everything to be white and it's a real treat to see these really glossy green moss beds and sometimes you can even see them photosynthesising. You can see little bubbles of oxygen coming off them into the water and being trapped under the icy layers in some of the lakes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> But over the last four years, summers in Antarctica have become extreme. The UV index has risen to 14, more than double what it was in the 1970s. It's now at similar levels to summer in Sydney and it's happening because of damage to the ozone layer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharon Robinson:</emphasis> It's very much more concerning if you have ozone depletion in December compared to ozone depletion in September and October when everything's under snow and nicely covered and protected by that reflective snowy layer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> In a paper published in Global Change Biology, Professor Robinson and three other international scientists have shown while the highest ozone depletion over Antarctica would previously have happened in September and October, it's now lasting through until December and natural disasters in Australia are partly to blame.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharon Robinson:</emphasis> In 2019-2020 the Australian bushfires were so intense that they pushed smoke particles up into the stratosphere and that meant there were more chemicals up in the stratosphere breaking down ozone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> We don't yet know how Antarctica's penguins and seals will cope with higher exposure to UV.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharon Robinson:</emphasis> Like us, they probably have some vulnerability in their eyes. One of the biggest things with humans, we either get skin cancer and the other big effect of sun, UV damage is cataracts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> But it is clear all animals and plants will need to invest more energy into sun protection.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharon Robinson:</emphasis> That is a cost to their growth and their reproduction so if they're putting energy into making melanin or algae in the sea can make microsporin-like amino acids so there's all these different sunscreen chemicals that animals and plants are really good at making but it costs to make sun protection and living in Antarctica is pretty tough anyway so I don't think they need any more stress.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> Sea ice researcher at the University of Tasmania, Dr Will Hobbs is also concerned by rising UV over Antarctica.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Hobbs:</emphasis> Ultraviolet radiation is an ionising radiation which means it can change your body chemistry and this is why UV light can cause cancer, skin cancers in humans, it's actually monkeys around with your DNA and animals and even algae and so on are no different.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> But he's optimistic about our power to preserve the Antarctic ecosystem.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Hobbs:</emphasis> We have agency here, how much warmer the planet gets is not really set in stone, we do have choices but those choices need to be made urgently. We need to worry not so much about 2050 targets, we need to think about 2030 targets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rachel Hayter:</emphasis> A swift global reduction in carbon emissions would give the hole in the ozone layer time to recover which would lower UV levels for Antarctica's precious animals and plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Samantha Donovan:</emphasis> Rachel Hayter reporting.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCAM-103774926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BWK-2YD1-JBN5-F008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PM(ABC Transcript)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4050\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 26, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000638</classCode><className>OZONE DEPLETION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DT1H</classCode><className>NATURAL SCIENCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Australia's High Commissioner to the UK George Brandis revealed the prince had personally made \"a substantial private donation\" to an Australian charity helping Australians recover from the devastation.</p><p>The novelist Lord Archer was the auctioneer and he extracted nearly ??100,000 ($198,000) for items donated, including a couture dress by designers Ralph &amp; Russo, business class flights and tickets to every match from Qantas and Cricket Australia, a private box at the Royal Albert Hall, lunch with and a personalised portrait by Barry Humphries and a backstage tour of Her Majesty's Theatre in London with Phantom of the Opera star Josh Piterman.</p><p>Melbourne-born Piterman, the widely acknowledged star of the night, sang Music of the Night and The Prayer at the event which was hosted by comedian Adam Hills, who capped off the evening singing the national anthem to the tune of Jimmy Barnes' Working Class Man.</p><p>Lord Archer revealed that Rupert Murdoch had phoned him that morning to lodge a bid worth ??15,000 for a small Russell Drysdale watercolour.</p><p>But Murdoch was immediately outbid by a buyer in the room when the media mogul was revealed as the bidder.</p><p>It is estimated that between ticket sales, a silent auction, private donations and the public auction the event raised more than half a million dollars.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520251735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDK-J171-JBJ7-N2V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><timeReceived>01:53 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

By limiting disturbance, forests can reach an appropriate age where they can be better protected from the increased frequency and severity of Australian bushfires.?<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Rob Rogers says the level of hazard reduction burning is already low, and reducing it would make little difference.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He says the Black Summer fires tore across 5.5 million hectares but in a busy year NSW authorities only deliberately burn about 200,000 hectares.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We get thousands of fires every year - there's accidental escape, there's arson, there's lightning. Most of the fires are not hazard reductions, they are other factors.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Hazard reduction compared to the whole landscape is just not that big. I can't see that making all these changes, I just don't think it's practicable.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Forestry Australia dismissed the findings, saying the consensus among bushfire scientists confirms prescribed burning is a key tool in managing bushfires. \"Reduced fuel levels in forests will reduce the severity of bushfires in all bar the most catastrophic fire weather conditions,\" says Tony Bartlett, the organisation's science policy advisor. ?Criticising prescribed burning is like dismissing the value of seat belts in cars because people still die in car accidents.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The peer reviewed research is published in the journal Biological Reviews.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B58-YVK1-DYG0-900X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><timeReceived>5:32 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.

By limiting disturbance, forests can reach an appropriate age where they can be better protected from the increased frequency and severity of Australian bushfires.?<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Rob Rogers says the level of hazard reduction burning is already low, and reducing it would make little difference.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He says the Black Summer fires tore across 5.5 million hectares but in a busy year NSW authorities only deliberately burn about 200,000 hectares.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We get thousands of fires every year - there's accidental escape, there's arson, there's lightning. Most of the fires are not hazard reductions, they are other factors.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Hazard reduction compared to the whole landscape is just not that big. I can't see that making all these changes, I just don't think it's practicable.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Forestry Australia dismissed the findings, saying the consensus among bushfire scientists confirms prescribed burning is a key tool in managing bushfires. \"Reduced fuel levels in forests will reduce the severity of bushfires in all bar the most catastrophic fire weather conditions,\" says Tony Bartlett, the organisation's science policy advisor. ?Criticising prescribed burning is like dismissing the value of seat belts in cars because people still die in car accidents.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The peer reviewed research is published in the journal Biological Reviews.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B58-YVK1-DYG0-900V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><timeReceived>5:32 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.

normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-31/nsw-south-coast-fires-rfs-emergency-warnings/11833712\">\"looking into the gates of hell\"</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For those of you who have been lucky enough to miss it, large areas of Australia remain engulfed by flames.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though the full toll of the devastation remains unclear, <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-03/nsw-vic-australia-bushfire-crisis-live-blog-january-3/11838342\">people have died, hundreds of properties have been razed</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/03/a-statement-about-the-480-million-animals-killed-in-nsw-bushfire.html\">more than 450 million animals are estimated to have been killed</url> since the start of the fire season.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the National Security Committee of Cabinet will <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-02/scott-morrison-urges-patience-and-calm-to-deal-with-bushfires/11837358\">meet on Monday</url> to consider the Federal Government's long-term response to the bushfire crisis.</p><p>How are politicians responding?</p><p>As the bushfires ravage communities, it seems as though there's one topic either on the tip of your tongue or at the bottom of your agenda: climate change.</p><p>The blazes have proven a lightning rod for concern around the warming climate - and the subsequent political response to it.</p><p>Mr Morrison previously said the <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-02/scott-morrison-urges-patience-and-calm-to-deal-with-bushfires/11837358\">best response to the fires was \"the way that Australians have always responded to these events\"</url> and said people should have confidence in state emergency services.</p><p>But he also confirmed the security committee would address \"contingencies\" required for the current fire season \"as well as the longer-term response and some issues we have identified to consider amongst premiers after the fires\".</p><p>Meanwhile, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the bushfires were \"certainly not business as usual\" and the situation should prompt a more ambitious response to emissions reduction.</p><p>Why is Scott Morrison under fire?</p><p>Anger over Mr Morrison's response to the fires has been mounting not only in Australia, but around the world.</p><p>The situation kicked off back in December when he was forced to <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-20/andrew-probyn-analysis-scott-morrison-hawaii-holiday/11817356\">apologise for holidaying in Hawaii as bushfires burned</url> across the country, later conceding with the benefit of hindsight he would have made a different decision.</p><p>Mr Morrison again found himself in hot water in the New Year after he said the fires were unfolding against the \"backdrop\" of the cricket - in this case a dead rubber against New Zealand.</p><p>But it was arguably his <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-03/scott-morrison-got-bushfire-welcome-he-deserved-says-liberal-mp/11838476\">visit to Cobargo, on the NSW South Coast, that brought the situation to a head</url>.</p><p>People in the town, <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-31/victoria-bushfire-trapping-people-in-east-gippsland-live-blog/11833630\">where a father and son died in a blaze earlier this week</url>, shouted and abused the Prime Minister during the brief trip.</p><p>In one particularly tense interaction, Mr Morrison grabbed the hand of a woman who had refused to shake his hand.</p><p>As the Prime Minister was leaving, people swore at him and told him he should be \"ashamed of himself\" after he \"left the country to burn\".</p><p>British broadcaster Piers Morgan has since waded into the debate, <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-03/scott-morrison-got-bushfire-welcome-he-deserved-says-liberal-mp/11838476\">echoing comments by senior NSW Liberal Andrew Constance that Mr Morrison got \"the welcome he probably deserved\"</url>.</p><p>\"Morrison got what he deserved ... absolutely unconscionable for a Prime Minister to holiday in Hawaii as his nation burns,\" Morgan tweeted.</p><p>Volunteer firefighters become the story</p><p>Volunteer fire crews have been run off their feet by the unprecedented nature of this season's bushfires, <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-21/volunteer-firefighters-deserve-compensation/11820016\">sparking widespread calls for compensation</url>.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-31/rfs-volunteer-firefighter-dies-in-truck-rollover/11833634\">deaths of three volunteer firefighters in the space of just two weeks</url> cemented those community sentiments, and some within the Federal Government       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-27/darren-chester-suggests-volunteer-firefighters-should-be-paid/11828474\">questioned the sustainability of unpaid brigades working for months on end.</url></p><p>After initially only offering an <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-24/firefighters-public-service-leave/11825416\">extra four weeks of paid leave to volunteer firefighters who were Government employees</url>, the Prime Minister announced       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-29/scott-morrison-announces-volunteer-firefighter-compensation/11830758\">volunteer crews in NSW would be able to apply for up to $6,000 in compensation</url> from the Federal Government.</p><p>That offer was <url

counterparts</url>.</p><p>Making headlines for all the wrong reasons</p><p>Australia's fauna may be renowned around the globe, but it's made headlines for all the wrong reasons in recent weeks.</p><p>A striking image of a kangaroo fleeing from a burning house was <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-03/australia-bushfire-crisis-in-pictures/11838792\">front page news in the United Kingdom</url>, with photographer Matthew Abbott describing the scene as \"like the apocalypse\".</p><p>\"Been covering the Australian bushfires for the last 6 weeks, but haven't seen anything like [Wednesday's] fire that decimated the town of Conjola, NSW,\" he tweeted.</p><p>Millions of native animals have died in the fires and there have been warnings that some populations and eco-systems may never recover.</p><p>It'll come as little surprise to those that have sweltered through the summer to date, but <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-02/2019-was-australias-hottest-and-driest-year-on-record/11837312\">the Bureau of Meteorology has already confirmed that 2019 was the hottest, driest year on

Australia's High Commissioner to the UK George Brandis revealed the prince had personally made \"a substantial private donation\" to an Australian charity helping Australians recover from the devastation.</p><p>The novelist Lord Archer was the auctioneer and he extracted nearly ??100,000 ($198,000) for items donated, including a couture dress by designers Ralph &amp; Russo, business class flights and tickets to every match from Qantas and Cricket Australia, a private box at the Royal Albert Hall, lunch with and a personalised portrait by Barry Humphries and a backstage tour of Her Majesty's Theatre in London with Phantom of the Opera star Josh Piterman.</p><p>Melbourne-born Piterman, the widely acknowledged star of the night, sang Music of the Night and The Prayer at the event which was hosted by comedian Adam Hills, who capped off the evening singing the national anthem to the tune of Jimmy Barnes' Working Class Man.</p><p>Lord Archer revealed that Rupert Murdoch had phoned him that morning to lodge a bid worth ??15,000 for a small Russell Drysdale watercolour.</p><p>But Murdoch was immediately outbid by a buyer in the room when the media mogul was revealed as the bidder.</p><p>It is estimated that between ticket sales, a silent auction, private donations and the public auction the event raised more than half a million dollars.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520251735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDN-62F1-JBJ7-N0T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><timeReceived>01:53 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It is the latest accumulation of all the best research and it runs to a mind-numbing 2391 pages.</p><p>On page 1586 it says: \"(Tropical cyclone) landfall frequency over Australia shows a decreasing trend in Eastern Australia since the 1800s, as well as in other parts of Australia since 1982. A paleoclimate proxy reconstruction shows that recent levels of (tropical cyclone) interactions along parts of the Australian coastline are the lowest in the past 550-1500 years.\" Pause on that. Not only does observation show there are fewer cyclones since the industrial revolution began belching extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, there is evidence to suggest cyclone activity in Australia is at its lowest ebb since the days of the Tang dynasty and the decline of the Western Roman Empire.</p><p>The CSIRO echoes that finding in its State of the Climate Report 2022 and adds: \"The trend in cyclone intensity in the Australian region is harder to quantify than cyclone frequency, due to uncertainties in estimating the intensity of individual cyclones and the relatively small number of intense cyclones.\" What of droughts? The IPCC finds southwestern Australia has been drying out since the 1950s and there is evidence that the length of droughts in southeastern Australia has \"increased significantly\". But it says \"the Millennium drought in eastern Australia was not unusual in the context of natural variability reconstructed over the past millennium\" and concludes \"there is currently low confidence that recent droughts in eastern Australia can be clearly attributed to human influence\" (p1089).</p><p>In summary, on page 1663, it says there is low confidence in observed trends, or projected changes, to droughts in central and eastern Australia as the climate warms. In northern Australia there is medium confidence of a \"decrease in the frequency and intensity of meteorological droughts\". So, more rain for the Top End then.</p><p>The report notes the major drivers of drought in Australia as well-known natural climate events: \"During the last millennium, the combined effect of a positive (Indian Ocean Dipole) and El Nino conditions have caused severe droughts over Australia\" (p1104).</p><p>What of bushfires? \"Extreme conditions, like the 2019 Australian bushfires and African flooding, have been associated with strong positive (Indian Ocean Dipole) conditions\" (p1104).</p><p>And, in case you were wondering, \"There is no evidence of a trend in the Indian Ocean Dipole mode and associated anthropogenic forcing\" and \"The amplitude of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability has increased since 1950 but there is no clear evidence of human influence\" (p1104).</p><p>Let's be clear. There is plenty of evidence in the IPCC report demonstrating the climate is changing, that the world and Australia are getting warmer, and that industrial activity has played a part in forcing some of it. We should take that seriously. In response Australia should do its proportionate share in cutting greenhouse gas emissions without destroying our local ecology or impoverishing the nation.</p><p>But here is the good news: we are not facing a climate Armageddon. Again, this is not just my view but one shared by British professor Jim Skea, who was appointed chairman of the IPCC last year.</p><p>\"The world won't end if it warms by more than 1.5 degrees,\" Skea told German weekly magazine Der Spiegel last year. \"It will however be a more dangerous world. Countries will struggle with many problems, there will be social tensions.</p><p>\"And yet this is not an existential threat to humanity. Even with 1.5 degrees of warming, we will not die out.\" Skea worries the zealots are doing their cause a grave disservice. \"If you constantly communicate the message that we are all doomed to extinction, then that paralyses people and prevents them from taking the necessary steps to get a grip on climate change,\" he said.</p><p>What it is also designed to do is scare people out of questioning absurd statements and bad policies.</p><p>Here there is another assault on reason by ideologues. In this game of witch burning, questioning a policy response to global warming is evidence of the crime of climate change denial. Their argument can be expressed as a syllogism.</p><p>Premise 1: Climate change is real.</p><p>Premise 2: Renewable energy combats climate change.</p><p>Conclusion: Therefore, to question renewable energy is to deny climate change. This is the logical fallacy of a false dichotomy; it ignores the possibility of neutrality or nuance. But logic, like science, has long since departed in this debate. This is all about faith.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-6b80fd841d5b11efa1de29e28a18940e150f750386e7aa300cbbbf9ecd58892a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C56-F2Y1-F0JP-W1W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1188\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 1, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Even with 1.5 degrees of warming, we will not die out.\"</p><p>Skea worries the zealots are doing their cause a grave disservice. \"If you constantly communicate the message that we are all doomed to extinction, then that paralyses people and prevents them from taking the necessary steps to get a grip on climate change,\" he said.</p><p>What it is also designed to do is scare people out of questioning absurd statements and bad policies. </p><p>Here there is another assault on reason by ideologues. In this game of witch burning, questioning a policy response to global warming is evidence of the crime of climate change denial. Their argument can be expressed as a syllogism.</p><p>Premise 1: Climate change is real.</p><p>Premise 2: Renewable energy combats climate change.</p><p>Conclusion: Therefore, to question renewable energy is to deny climate change.</p><p>This is the logical fallacy of a false dichotomy; it ignores the possibility of neutrality or nuance. But logic, like science, has long since departed in this debate. This is all about faith.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Now is the time for those right-wing columnists to deny climate change, not May 2024.</p><p>Travis, Clifton Beach</p><p>Re Judges decision not to declare a youth violent. I always carry bolt cutters on public transport. You never know when you may need to cut something off a bus. Really! When are these judges going to grow a backbone.</p><p>Old timer, Cairns</p><p>With such bad polling, I wonder if state gov will find a hearing aid to save a few seats. No means No.</p><p>G.A, Westcourt</p><p>50% of Australian bushfires are lit by arsonists, 76 in Qld this year so far. The rest are human error or lightning strikes. No proof that the east coast of Australia will be under water for several centuries to come. But still green cult climate alarmists, highly educated in our esteemed universities, still preaching that 1.5 trillion borrowed dollars must be spent on foreign owned renewable energy projects.</p><p>Rex, Edmonton</p><p>Why is it that we have a federal referendum on the Voice but the states don't have to ask us whether we want treaty? Good on Crisafulli for growing some Bs.</p><p>Ray, Ravenshoe</p><p>After the worst fire conditions he had witnessed in Qld in 43 years of service, I wonder if QFRS Superintendent Waltisbuhl (CP 27/10) would be classed as an \"alarmist\" by climate change denying ostriches.</p><p>Dominic, Redlynch</p><p>Re: Wilfred, CP, (27/10) Mate, university education does not guarantee intelligence, just as youth does not guarantee it either.</p><p>Greg, Kanimbla</p><p>Re: Atticus (CP, 27/10) Why, what would he see, other than the things he described? He's extremely familiar with the problems. He just doesn't pander to the white-guilt brigade who cannot face facts.</p><p>Stu, Brinsmead</p><p>The good old days Bill Blackmore (CP 28/10) Are you kidding me? I wish I got picked up and driven to school, had a mobile phone, wide-screen TV, slept in an airconditioned room and didn't have to worry about being conscripted to fight in Africa, New Guinea or Vietnam.</p><p>Clive, Trinity Beach</p><p>So the council wants to employ 5 security guards for the CBD.
