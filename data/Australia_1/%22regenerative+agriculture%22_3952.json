Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER COMMONWEALTH EQUITY SERVICES, LLC SELLS</p><p>COMMONWEALTH EQUITY SERVICES, LLC (CIK:0000312272) sold 21,488 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER COMMONWEALTH EQUITY SERVICES, LLC SELLS</p><p>COMMONWEALTH EQUITY SERVICES, LLC (CIK:0000312272) sold 21,488 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP SELLS</p><p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp (CIK:0001390777) sold 226,376 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP SELLS</p><p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp (CIK:0001390777) sold 226,376 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP SELLS</p><p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp (CIK:0001390777) sold 226,376 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP SELLS</p><p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp (CIK:0001390777) sold 226,376 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND DIRECTOR/PDMR SHAREHOLDING</p><p>NOTIFICATION OF TRANSACTIONS BY PERSONS DISCHARGING MANAGERIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERSONS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM</p><p>Source: West Corporation</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND HALF-YEAR REPORT</p><p>14August 2025</p><p>2025 Interim Results Highlights</p><p>Admiral Group reports excellent H1 2025 results</p><p>1 Alternative Performance Measures refer to the end of the report for definition and explanation.</p><p>2 Re-presented on a continuing operations basis, to exclude the US Insurance result following the announcement of its planned sale.</p><p>Over 13,000 employees will each receive free share awards worth up to 1,800 under the employee share schemes based on the interim 2025 results.</p><p>Comment from Milena Mondini de Focatiis, Group Chief Executive Officer:</p><p>We have delivered another excellent first half with strong execution across all strategic objectives.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER TD ASSET MANAGEMENT INC.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND DIRECTOR/PDMR SHAREHOLDING</p><p>NOTIFICATION OF TRANSACTIONS BY PERSONS DISCHARGING MANAGERIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERSONS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM</p><p>Source: West Corporation</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND HALF-YEAR REPORT</p><p>14August 2025</p><p>2025 Interim Results Highlights</p><p>Admiral Group reports excellent H1 2025 results</p><p>1 Alternative Performance Measures refer to the end of the report for definition and explanation.</p><p>2 Re-presented on a continuing operations basis, to exclude the US Insurance result following the announcement of its planned sale.</p><p>Over 13,000 employees will each receive free share awards worth up to 1,800 under the employee share schemes based on the interim 2025 results.</p><p>Comment from Milena Mondini de Focatiis, Group Chief Executive Officer:</p><p>We have delivered another excellent first half with strong execution across all strategic objectives.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER TD ASSET MANAGEMENT INC.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND DIRECTOR/PDMR SHAREHOLDING</p><p>NOTIFICATION OF TRANSACTIONS BY PERSONS DISCHARGING MANAGERIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERSONS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM</p><p>Source: West Corporation</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND HALF-YEAR REPORT</p><p>14August 2025</p><p>2025 Interim Results Highlights</p><p>Admiral Group reports excellent H1 2025 results</p><p>1 Alternative Performance Measures refer to the end of the report for definition and explanation.</p><p>2 Re-presented on a continuing operations basis, to exclude the US Insurance result following the announcement of its planned sale.</p><p>Over 13,000 employees will each receive free share awards worth up to 1,800 under the employee share schemes based on the interim 2025 results.</p><p>Comment from Milena Mondini de Focatiis, Group Chief Executive Officer:</p><p>We have delivered another excellent first half with strong execution across all strategic objectives.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND DIRECTOR/PDMR SHAREHOLDING</p><p>NOTIFICATION OF TRANSACTIONS BY PERSONS DISCHARGING MANAGERIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERSONS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM</p><p>Source: West Corporation</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND HALF-YEAR REPORT</p><p>14August 2025</p><p>2025 Interim Results Highlights</p><p>Admiral Group reports excellent H1 2025 results</p><p>1 Alternative Performance Measures refer to the end of the report for definition and explanation.</p><p>2 Re-presented on a continuing operations basis, to exclude the US Insurance result following the announcement of its planned sale.</p><p>Over 13,000 employees will each receive free share awards worth up to 1,800 under the employee share schemes based on the interim 2025 results.</p><p>Comment from Milena Mondini de Focatiis, Group Chief Executive Officer:</p><p>We have delivered another excellent first half with strong execution across all strategic objectives.

where bees, trees and livestock thrive, writes FIONA SHEEAN From boilermaker to Nuffield Scholar, Jackie Morrison's journey to regenerative farming hasn't followed a conventional path.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, nothing about Honeyvale Farm at McLeans Ridges in the NSW Northern Rivers region, fits the traditional mould.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 40-hectare operation runs on circular economy principles where supermarket food waste feeds free-range pigs that produce high-quality salami, while 70 beehives provide raw honey and specialty beeswax products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Add in 750 pecan trees, rainforest restoration and plans for farm-stay tourism, and Jackie and her husband Luke Edwards' vision extends far beyond typical agricultural boundaries.</p><p>\"To me, farming is about the long-term plan - you're wondering what your soil will look like in 100 years, not just next year,\" Jackie said.</p><p>FORMULA THAT WORKS Diversification is key on their farm with bees contributing 75 per cent of income, pigs 20 per cent, and the remaining 5 per cent free-range chickens, eggs and agistment.</p><p>\"We run 16 pigs maximum at a time in a big fenced paddock,\" Jackie said. \"Once a week they move along to \" Continued Page 54 \" From Page 53 the next square in the rotation, and we sow a cover crop behind them.\" The pigs also consume fruit, vegetables and bread waste from local supermarkets to prevent it going to landfill.</p><p>The cover crops that follow the pigs provide bee forage, while pig manure fertilises the future pecan orchard.</p><p>The operation currently produces four tonnes of salami annually, made by fourth-generation Italian salami makers at nearby Biggera Waters, NSW.</p><p>\"The only thing that doesn't get used is the squeal,\" Jackie said, adding how pecan oil in the pigs' diet created a unique flavour profile in the final product.</p><p>\"Wherever we do tastings at markets, the salami sells itself - it's beautiful,\" Jackie said.</p><p>SWEET SPOT While diversification defines Honeyvale Farm's approach, beekeeping remains its economic cornerstone, with apiaries strategically placed across market gardens, macadamia farms and native bushland throughout the Northern Rivers region.</p><p>The operation centres on Langstroth hives chosen for their convenience and bee-friendly design, with honey cold-extracted to preserve natural enzymes, pollen and health benefits.</p><p>The couple harvest year- round, packing 15 tonnes of honey and a tonne of high-quality beeswax each year.</p><p>The wax is a valuable secondary income stream that reaches diverse markets from local wrap makers to Melbourne pastry companies and commercial fruit operations in Queensland.</p><p>The farm also produces its own limited range of value-added products including lip balms, beeswax wraps, candles and various balms.</p><p>KNOWLEDGE SHARING Jackie and Luke's community focus extends to their Ballina Honey business, which operates like a co-operative without the administrative burden.</p><p>Besides processing their own honey, the couple purchase it from about 20 local suppliers - from backyard beekeepers to commercial operators.</p><p>\"People can come and get a good price for their honey and not worry about the admin side of it,\" Jackie said.</p><p>\"Some only have five hives in their backyard and they sell us their excess honey - others have 400-plus hives and we buy by the tonne.\" The couple wholesale to shops across the Northern Rivers and retail through their website and Alstonville Markets, where Jackie values direct consumer interaction.</p><p>\"Markets are a great way to have a chat,\" she said, noting how many people lacked understanding about bees and pollination systems.</p><p>Those interactions have prompted future plans that include farm stay accommodation, beekeeping courses and children's programs to reconnect urban populations with food production systems.</p><p>\"There is a big influx of people from Sydney and Melbourne who don't have any connection to their food and farming systems anywhere,\" Jackie said.</p><p>\"It would be really good in the long run to have more adults and kids come to the farm and get connected with the soil, bees and pollinating.\" INNOVATION UNDER PRESSURE Jackie's world shifted in 2022 when Varroa mite was first detected in Australia. She volunteered with the Department of Primary Industries during the emergency response at Newcastle, NSW, where it was discovered in sentinel hives.</p><p>\"After volunteering there I realised just how unprepared Australian beekeepers were for pests like varroa destructor,\" she said.</p><p>The Northern Rivers hosts Australia's highest concentration of amateur beekeepers, many operating outside formal networks and unaware of emerging threats.</p><p>\"Many aren't part of bee clubs and aren't educated on best practices,\" Jackie said.</p><p>Varroa's arrival has fundamentally changed management practices. \"Varroa is everywhere in the world outside of Australia and has been for years, but it hasn't been studied in tropical climates like ours where we harvest year-round,\" Jackie said.</p><p>Traditional beekeeping involves opening hives three to four times yearly, but Varroa requires monthly alcohol washes to monitor mite levels.</p><p>\"The number of hives one person can manage has gone right down,\" Jackie said, adding how this impacted the economics of smaller operations.</p><p>The couple trials practical innovations including brood trapping techniques learned from European beekeepers, where queens are caged to concentrate mites in specific brood areas that can be removed and fed to chickens.</p><p>They're also trialling queens from breeding programs selecting for Varroa-resistant traits, though Jackie said most Australian bees currently lacked the hygienic behaviours common in other countries.</p><p>\"Bees that have developed resistance - that is a long-term goal,\" Jackie said. BUILDING RESILIENCE The farm's diversification strategy proved crucial during recent challenges. Jackie and Luke purchased the property during severe drought in 2019, then soon after faced the Northern Rivers' worst flooding in 2022.</p><p>Off-farm income has been essential with Jackie continuing boilermaker work to fund capital expenses while building farm enterprises.</p><p>\"If we wanted to be straight out commercial and not worry about anything else, we wouldn't have to work off farm,\" she said.</p><p>\"But off-farm income pays for our varroa management trials.\" Jackie's 2023 Nuffield Scholarship, supported by AgriFutures, examined Integrated Pest Management in beekeeping across Europe, North America and the Pacific with particular focus on potential tropical climate applications relevant to Australian conditions.</p><p>LEGACY THINKING Jackie's global research has reinforced the couple's commitment to solutions that work over decades, not just seasons.</p><p>The pecan trees represent long-term thinking that characterises regenerative agriculture.</p><p>Pecans suit local conditions with few pests, deep taproots for nutrient cycling, and deciduous canopies enabling inter-row cropping.</p><p>Jackie and Luke have replanted eight hectares to Big Scrub Lowland Subtropical Rainforest through a Greenfleet partnership, restoring habitat in what was once Australia's largest lowland subtropical rainforest.</p><p>\"The important part of regenerative agriculture - it's all about saying we've tried this, is it working?\" Jackie said.</p><p>\"We are finding chemical-free and good environmental and community solutions to things that will do the best in the long run even if it is harder in the short term.\" .</p><p>JACKIE MORRISON HONEYVALE FARM, MCLEANS RIDGES, NSW THE 40ha farm runs on circular economy principles THEY have 70 beehives, free-range pigs, pecan trees and chickens PACK 15 tonnes of honey each year PRODUCE their own value-added products .</p><p>The hunt is on for The Weekly Times Coles 2025 Farmer of the Year.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER TD ASSET MANAGEMENT INC.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER TD ASSET MANAGEMENT INC.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [5 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER DEKABANK DEUTSCHE GIROZENTRALE SELLS</p><p>Dekabank Deutsche Girozentrale (CIK:0001456228) sold 942 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER MARKEL CORP BUYS</p><p>Markel Corp (CIK:0001096343) bought 22,500 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER KOSHINSKI ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [5 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER DEKABANK DEUTSCHE GIROZENTRALE SELLS</p><p>Dekabank Deutsche Girozentrale (CIK:0001456228) sold 942 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CBOE VEST FINANCIAL, LLC SELLS</p><p>CBOE Vest Financial, LLC (CIK:0001709632) sold 107,115 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

The degradation of soil in Australia is a barrier to its health, in terms of how poor soils are now and how low organic matter is.\"</p><p>There were two key steps Queensland graziers could take to understand their soil improvement journey.</p><p>\"One, digging multiple holes in the field, underneath fencelines and in undisturbed areas to look at what's really happening with water infiltration,\" she said.</p><p>\"Then doing a slaking test, [that shows] how well your soil holds together.</p><p>\"You only need a little aggregate of soil [for a slaking test]: I want you to put it into a cup of water and to look at whether it holds onto its structure or collapses.</p><p>\"This [test] looks at the difference between fungi being active and not active.\"</p><p>Ms Masters said underground networks of fungi called mycorrhizae supported pastures by transporting air, water and nutrients through soil systems.</p><p>\"Fungi make glues and exudates that stick, proteins and nitrogen that will hold soil together,\" she said. </p><p>\"They increase the access to water by about 20 per cent from about two per cent of surface area that a plant can capture without mycorrhizal. They also release nutrients bound on rocks: you will never run out of minerals.\"</p><p>The amount of organic matter in soils was directly and indirectly linked to pasture resilience, nutrition, water retention, overall health and its ability to generate a profit, according to Ms Masters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/241483465/fd40433b-90a3-42e9-a34f-3b0588ccbb8e.jpg\">Ms Masters said she was blown away by the interest in regenerative agriculture in Queensland, but many graziers probably didn't realise how much credible innovation was happening here.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [5 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER DEKABANK DEUTSCHE GIROZENTRALE SELLS</p><p>Dekabank Deutsche Girozentrale (CIK:0001456228) sold 942 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [5 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER DEKABANK DEUTSCHE GIROZENTRALE SELLS</p><p>Dekabank Deutsche Girozentrale (CIK:0001456228) sold 942 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-160825043624980005670181102130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH4-9NB3-RVFW-73TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2191\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER MARKEL CORP BUYS</p><p>Markel Corp (CIK:0001096343) bought 22,500 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER MARKEL CORP BUYS</p><p>Markel Corp (CIK:0001096343) bought 22,500 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER MARKEL CORP BUYS</p><p>Markel Corp (CIK:0001096343) bought 22,500 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER MARKEL CORP BUYS</p><p>Markel Corp (CIK:0001096343) bought 22,500 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER KOSHINSKI ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER AUSTRALIAN SUPER PTY LTD SELLS</p><p>Australian Super Pty Ltd (CIK:0001694164) sold 288,290 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CYNDEO WEALTH PARTNERS, LLC BUYS</p><p>Cyndeo Wealth Partners, LLC (CIK:0001950947) bought 205 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-150825043632980005670180102130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGX-BDP3-RTF0-T260-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2191\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER CYNDEO WEALTH PARTNERS, LLC BUYS</p><p>Cyndeo Wealth Partners, LLC (CIK:0001950947) bought 205 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER AUSTRALIAN SUPER PTY LTD SELLS</p><p>Australian Super Pty Ltd (CIK:0001694164) sold 288,290 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER KOSHINSKI ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER AUSTRALIAN SUPER PTY LTD SELLS</p><p>Australian Super Pty Ltd (CIK:0001694164) sold 288,290 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   CARGILL: CARGILL SETS A NEW GLOBAL BENCHMARK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE COCOA SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>Cargill today announced a transformation of its global cocoa supply chain, unveiling a series of interconnected investments that reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste, and boost efficiency from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe. The company's upgrades span renewable energy, circular logistics, and smart infrastructure.</p><p>\"Sustainability isn't a single project at Cargill-it's how we operate,\" said Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa &amp; Chocolate Europe and West Africa. \"From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we're showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.\"</p><p>In Cote d'Ivoire, cocoa shells once discarded are now used to fuel biomass boilers. In Ghana, a solar plant powers production in Tema, and new ISO tanks are replacing disposable packaging, providing the opportunity to cut up to 100 metric tons of waste each month.</p><p>Once the beans and semi-finished cocoa products produced in origin arrive in Europe, they enter a fully integrated logistics network. Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, then transported to Cargill's factory in Zaandam via the world's first fully electric barges-eliminating 190,000 kg of CO&amp;#8322; emissions annually. The electricity for these vessels, and for Cargill's Dutch facilities, comes from Windpark Hanze, a renewable energy partnership with Vattenfall.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER KLP KAPITALFORVALTNING AS BUYS</p><p>KLP KAPITALFORVALTNING AS (CIK:0001717443) bought 28,800 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [9 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER AUSTRALIAN SUPER PTY LTD SELLS</p><p>Australian Super Pty Ltd (CIK:0001694164) sold 288,290 shares in the quarter ended Jun 30, 2025.

Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY [4 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ARCHER DANIELS MIDLANDINSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER KOSHINSKI ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.

This initiative aims to combine certified carbon offsets with premium commodity exports, enhancing sustainability compliance, traceability, and differentiation for global institutional buyers.</p><p>Advancing a Carbon-Integrated Commodity Model</p><p>In response to increasing demand for ESG-aligned trade and voluntary carbon market participation, Davis Commodities is preparing to introduce carbon-offset-linked transactions across select product lines. The initial rollout is expected to feature Bonsucro-certified sugar and ISCC-certified rice, with each shipment planned to include a verified volume of carbon credits to support buyer net-zero objectives.</p><p>The company intends to source these credits from Gold Standard and Verra-certified reforestation and regenerative agriculture projects and is also evaluating blockchain-based carbon registries to enhance traceability and reporting. In parallel, Davis Commodities is in the early stages of developing a proprietary digital dashboard that will allow clients to monitor, audit, and eventually retire their carbon credits in real time.</p><p>Capturing Opportunity in a Growing Market</p><p>Based on internal research and industry projections, Davis Commodities estimates a potential $2 billion addressable opportunity in carbon-integrated agricultural trading over the next three years.</p><p>ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT [Link]</p><p>Davis Commodities Explores Carbon Credit Trading Unit to Integrate ESG with Certified Commodity Trade can be viewed via the link below.</p><p>Source:  West Corporation Click <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.net/BuySellSignals/report/Usnasdaq/Stock/News/202507159494662-en_9999999_0.html\">http://www.buysellsignals.net/BuySellSignals/report/Usnasdaq/Stock/News/202507159494662-en_9999999_0.html</url></p><p>COMPANY IDENTIFIERS</p><p>Exchange: NASDAQ</p><p>RIC: DTCK.O</p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.BuySellSignals.com\">www.BuySellSignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRUBSG-180725151411604300016946</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRUBSG2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G93-0SF3-RT37-X4G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367750</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"340\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

As a global leader in agriculture and food, Cargill marked its third consecutive year of participation, showcasing its diverse supply chain solutions once again in the Green Agriculture Chain Zone. Through an immersive booth experience, Cargill systematically demonstrated its end-to-end supply chain capabilities enabled by global-local synergy, highlighting its pioneering practices and long-term commitment to enhancing supply chain resilience and advancing the sustainability of the global food system.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   PEPSICO AND CARGILL COLLABORATE TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>PURCHASE, N.Y. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 - PepsiCo and Cargill today announced a strategic collaboration to advance regenerative agriculture practices across 240,000 acres from 2025 through 2030.</p><p>The partnership will focus on the companies' shared corn supply chain in Iowa, where Cargill sources from local farmers to produce ingredients used in some of PepsiCo's most iconic products. Agriculture, and creating a more resilient agricultural system, is essential to PepsiCo's business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries to make its convenient foods and beverages. As a global supplier to PepsiCo, Cargill plays a key role in aligning the supply chain from farm to shelf. Together, the companies aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support positive outcomes for farming communities by helping them implement regenerative practices, and unlock new opportunities for advancing sustainable agriculture at scale.</p><p>Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system.</p><p>\"By partnering across the supply chain - and working with farmers to understand what's best for their farms - we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers,\" said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer. \"This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.\"</p><p>This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-150825193718980005670181102130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH2-VC33-RSJT-D14G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2191\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.
