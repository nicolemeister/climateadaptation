they love getting photos of kids on hay bales or old tractors as props,\" Nick said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The former finance worker has transformed the family's 34 hectare weekender, nestled within a green wedge zone five kilometres from the coast at Flinders, into a viable and sustainable agricultural enterprise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It began as a small-scale garlic operation nine years ago in 2016 but more recently Nick and Jay have diversified with cut flowers, berry picking experiences and on-farm accommodation making up their evolving business model.</p><p>Leveraging tourism dollars has helped underwrite their agricultural production costs.</p><p>\"Ideally we want 40 per cent of our income from garlic, 40 per cent between flowers and berries, and 20 per cent from accommodation on the property,\" Nick said. </p><p>\"It is nice to have that underlying base income so if you did have a season where you lost all your garlic, it insulates you from that a bit.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AN UNEXPECTED START</emphasis></p><p>Nick's journey into agriculture began unexpectedly. </p><p>\"I had a real pull to stay on the farm as much as possible,\" he said. </p><p>A chance meeting with a chef introduced him to black garlic in 2018, launching his original business, Flinders Black Garlic.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/agribusiness/young-couple-reap-financial-rewards-from-small-farm/news-story/3f17dc25efb442bad941325a5dce91c0\">\"We were building that up quite nicely, and then covid hit,\" Nick said.</url></p><p>The pandemic forced a pivot. </p><p>\"The first lockdown, everyone was excited and still getting paid so people were cooking at home - we sold lots of garlic online,\" he said.</p><p>As restaurants closed, Nick and Jay transitioned to fresh garlic production, which proved less labour-intensive than black garlic processing. </p><p>Today, their garlic operation spans 1.2ha, with plans to expand to up to 3ha next season and capping at 6ha in the longer term.</p><p>However, rising costs have presented economic challenges. </p><p>\"I found my cost of production was three times higher doing organic than conventional,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"Our cost of production per hectare is about $60,000 for organic, whereas for conventional it is about $20,000. </p><p>\"When we first started growing organic, there was a price differential - our costs were double what they were for conventional but we were getting double the money so it made economic sense.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDUCING GREEN WASTE</emphasis></p><p>Their biggest costs are labour and the extensive use of weed matting, which is essential for organic production but presents its own environmental concerns.</p><p>\"Weed gunnel is used extensively for weed management, but it's expensive and cannot be reused when growing garlic at scale,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"Currently, the only method of disposal is sending it to landfill. </p><p>\"This contributes to the reason organic garlic is so expensive - it's the high cost of production.\"</p><p>This challenge sparked his successful application for a 2024 Nuffield Scholarship to help solve the environmental paradox of organic garlic farming and find ways to reduce waste and costs. </p><p>The benefits would be two-fold.</p><p>\"It would encourage producers to consider growing garlic using organic methods, which improves the quality of the garlic and soil health,\" Nick said. </p><p>\"It would also make buying organic garlic more affordable for consumers and open it up to a bigger number of shoppers.\"</p><p>Organic garlic currently retails for between 25 and 40 per cent more than conventional garlic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUTTING COSTS</emphasis></p><p>Nick has already completed extensive international travel for the scholarship, including visits to Indonesia, France, Denmark, California, and Chile.</p><p>\"As a first-generation farmer, I've found it incredibly valuable,\" he said.</p><p>The scholarship research focuses on finding economically and environmentally sustainable methods for organic garlic production. </p><p>Nick, who is on the board of the Australian Garlic Industry Association, said the research aligned with the industry's strategic plan to help address supply, production, climatic and sustainability challenges.</p><p>His immediate plan on the farm is mechanisation.</p><p>\"We're in transition from doing it all by hand to mechanising,\" Nick said. </p><p>\"Currently, it takes a week to roll out all the weed matting with eight to 12 people. </p><p>\"For planting, it can take three to five days, so it's a two-week process just to get the garlic in the ground.\"</p><p>At a cost of between $5000 and $7000, Nick hopes to purchase a basic mechanical planter and harvester and have them operational by May 2026.</p><p>\"I'm not looking to spend a huge amount of money but the most important thing is you could do it with two people and in a short space of time,\" he said, cutting labour costs by more than 80 per cent.</p><p>For weed management, he is exploring cutting-edge technologies from Germany that use rubber tynes between rows.</p><p>\"There is all sorts of new technology coming out from laser weeding to precision farming and we are looking to bring some of that to our farm from next season,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STRATEGIC MARKETING</emphasis></p><p>They have trialled a variety of seedstock over the years with soft neck Italian purple and Dunganski proving the most successful on the clay-loam soil and with their average annual rainfall of 700mmto 800mm.</p><p>Growing conditions have been drier than average in recent years and while garlic is not a water intensive crop, irrigation from dams and a bore is available to draw on towards the end of the growing season in spring and early summer.</p><p>Soil and leaf analysis tests are conducted for targeted fertiliser application and mixed species cover crops are planted in resting paddocks.</p><p>They plant about half a tonne of garlic per hectare and harvest 10 tonnes or more annually.</p><p>A third of each harvest is retained as seedstock for the following year.</p><p>Ninety per cent of their garlic is sold to a chain of greengrocers in Melbourne via large weekly orders, while the remainder is sold at the farm gate and local retail outlets.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/horticulture/the-paddock-lal-lal-wins-gold-for-aussie-grown-garlic/news-story/106aa22d7dc69f62d139de64e0b60285\">\"Australian growers account for only 15 to 20 per cent of garlic consumed in Australia,\" Nick said.</url>\u00a0</p><p>\"A lot is imported from China. In terms of price, we couldn't even come close to competing.</p><p>\"But the difference in the product is immeasurable. Fresh Aussie garlic versus Chinese - it's like chalk and cheese.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALIGNING CONSUMER DEMAND</emphasis></p><p>Nick has observed shifting consumer preferences that align with his business model.</p><p>\"There's been a shift from consumers - not necessarily organic, but where the garlic comes from,\" he said. </p><p>\"The provenance or locale of it has become as important as the organic side.\"</p><p>Nick and Jay maintain a focus on soil health and sustainability. </p><p>\"We want to leave the property in a better shape than when we first got it,\" he said. </p><p>Their soil health has improved significantly with less compaction, weed pressure and improved pH levels.</p><p>\"We had a great interest in regenerative agriculture and that's where cover cropping came in,\" Nick said. </p><p>\"We put in radish - it has a big strong root to help break up the soil and that has helped. </p><p>\"The next step would be to integrate some livestock before we

A chance meeting with a chef introduced him to black garlic in 2018, launching his original business, Flinders Black Garlic.</p><p>\"We were building that up quite nicely, and then Covid hit,\" Nick said. The pandemic forced a pivot.</p><p>\"The first lockdown, everyone was excited and still getting paid so people were cooking at home - we sold lots of garlic online,\" he said.</p><p>As restaurants closed, Nick and Jay transitioned to fresh garlic production, which proved less labour-intensive than black garlic processing.</p><p>Today, their garlic operation spans 1.2ha, with plans to expand to up to 3ha next season and capping at 6ha in the longer term.</p><p>However, rising costs have presented economic challenges.</p><p>\"I found my cost of production was three times higher doing organic than conventional,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"Our cost of production per hectare is about $60,000 for organic, whereas for conventional it is about $20,000.</p><p>\"When we first started growing organic, there was a price differential - our costs were double what they were for conventional but we were getting double the money so it made economic sense.\" REDUCING GREEN WASTE Their biggest costs are labour and the extensive use of weed matting, which is essential for organic production but presents its own environmental concerns.</p><p>\"Weed gunnel is used extensively for weed management, but it's expensive and cannot be reused when growing garlic at scale,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"Currently, the only method of disposal is sending it to landfill. \"This contributes to the reason organic garlic is so expensive - it's the high cost of production.\" This challenge sparked his successful application for a 2024 Nuffield Scholarship to help solve the environmental paradox of organic garlic farming and find ways to reduce waste and costs.</p><p>The benefits would be two-fold.</p><p>\"It would encourage producers to consider growing garlic using organic methods, which improves the quality of the garlic and soil health,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"It would also make buying organic garlic more affordable for consumers and open it up to a bigger number of shoppers.\" Organic garlic currently retails for between 25 and 40 per cent more than conventional garlic.</p><p>CUTTING COSTS Nick has already completed extensive international travel for the scholarship, including visits to Indonesia, France, Denmark, California, and Chile.</p><p>The scholarship research focuses on finding economically and environmentally sustainable methods for organic garlic production.</p><p>Nick, who is on the board of the Australian Garlic Industry Association, said the research aligned with the industry's strategic plan to help address supply, production, climatic and sustainability challenges.</p><p>His immediate plan on the farm is mechanisation.</p><p>\"We're in transition from doing it all by hand to mechanising,\" Nick said. \"Currently, it takes a week to roll out all the weed matting with eight to 12 people.</p><p>\"For planting, it can take three to five days, so it's a two-week process just to get the garlic in the ground.\" At a cost of between $5000 and $7000, Nick hopes to purchase a basic mechanical planter and harvester and have them operational by May 2026.</p><p>\"I'm not looking to spend a huge amount of money but the most important thing is you could do it with two people and in a short space of time,\" he said, cutting labour costs by more than 80 per cent.</p><p>For weed management, he is exploring cutting-edge technologies from Germany that use rubber tynes between rows.</p><p>\"There is all sorts of new technology coming out from laser weeding to precision farming and we are looking to bring some of that to our farm from next season,\" he said.</p><p>STRATEGIC MARKETING They have trialled a variety of seedstock over the years with soft neck Italian purple and Dunganski proving the most successful on the clay-loam soil and with their average annual rainfall of 700mm to 800mm.</p><p>Growing conditions have been drier than average in recent years and while garlic is not a water intensive crop, irrigation from dams and a bore is available to draw on towards the end of the growing season in spring and early summer.</p><p>Soil and leaf analysis tests are conducted for targeted fertiliser application and mixed species cover crops are planted in resting paddocks.</p><p>They plant about half a tonne of garlic per hectare and harvest 10 tonnes or more annually.</p><p>A third of each harvest is retained as seedstock for the following year. Ninety per cent of their garlic is sold to a chain of greengrocers in Melbourne via large weekly orders, while the remainder is sold at the farm gate and local retail outlets.</p><p>\"Australian growers account for only 15 to 20 per cent of garlic consumed in Australia,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"A lot is imported from China.</p><p>\"In terms of price, we couldn't even come close to competing. \"But the difference in the product is immeasurable. Fresh Aussie garlic versus Chinese - it's like chalk and cheese.\" ALIGNING WITH DEMAND Nick has observed shifting consumer preferences that align with his business model.</p><p>\"There's been a shift from consumers - not necessarily organic, but where the garlic comes from,\" he said.</p><p>\"The provenance or locale of it has become as important as the organic side.\" Nick and Jay maintain a focus on soil health and sustainability. \"We want to leave the property in a better shape than when we first got it,\" he said.</p><p>Their soil health has improved significantly with less compaction, weed pressure and improved pH levels.</p><p>\"We had a great interest in regenerative agriculture and that's where cover cropping came in,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"We put in radish - it has a big strong root to help break up the soil and that has helped.</p><p>\"The next step would be to integrate some livestock before we replant into it.\" The couple has a keen interest in agroforestry and together with local Landcare groups, they have planted shelter belts around the perimeter of the farm.</p><p>DIVERSITY IS KEY While running multiple enterprises on the farm can be a juggle, Nick said their strategic diversification across premium garlic production, flower growing and agritourism had created a resilient business model capable of weathering both market fluctuations and seasonal challenges.</p><p>Two hectares are dedicated to flowers including sunflowers, dahlias, snapdragons, ranunculus, delphinium and poppies.

You don't just think short term and optimise for that. You should think about where your company's headed and how it stays sustainable and how you continue growth over decades,\" Mr Adams said.</p><p>\"The evidence that we are seeing from markets, whether that's agriculture, energy etc, they're all heading in directions that are compatible with climate change science, with what we need to do on the nature front and environment.</p><p>\"I think leaders with real foresight are all heading in that direction, regardless of what governments might say.\" Ms Miller, who heads the couple's eco-focused venture fund Wedgetail - which also offers green loans - said environmental sustainability and economic growth were not mutually exclusive. \"While there's a lot of it happening geopolitically across the globe, I think many people are really understanding that when we're talking about the environment, we're actually talking about human health and the health of our communities and societies. And so it really needs to come and play a bigger role and not be excluded from economic decisions and discussions,\" said Ms Miller, who is a zoologist and has worked at the Australian Museum.</p><p>And Mr Adams said giving away their wealth to environmental causes was also extra motivation to continue to grow Canva.</p><p>\"That's one of the great things about The Giving Pledge. When you make that pledge to give half of your wealth, the wealth that you have today is a fraction of what you might have in the future.</p><p>\"Canva is growing amazingly. The business is doing incredibly well, which I get to spend most of my time on. So it's good to be able to steer that and know that as I'm growing Canva, it enables the Canva foundation, it enables Wedgetail to grow in their impact as well.\" Wedgetail has given green loans to cacao and coffee businesses in the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Colombia. It has also backed carbon accounting software platform Sumday; Superorganism, the first venture firm dedicated to biodiversity; and Courageous Land, which promotes reforestation and conversation via agroforestry. Under its green loans, interest rates are lowered as companies meet contractually agreed environmental targets. \"There are green loans out there, so it's not like it's the most innovative model ever, but we are definitely knocking off far more basis points than most banks,\" Ms Miller said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-91496ef0345e11f0a0aaf4deb1ef9f9774398e3d251cdd5b6970d629b577d792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FVG-4TT3-RRT8-D11V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 20, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

As members of Farmers for Climate Action, we feel well placed to comment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Saur makes some good points - particularly that farming should be about responsible land stewardship, and that farmers can contribute to supplying high-quality timber for construction. </p><p>However, there are several points I take issue with.</p><p>I dispute the claim that most of Tasmania's forests are dry sclerophyll. </p><p>These are primarily found in the central and eastern regions. Over 40 per cent of dry sclerophyll vegetation has already been lost to agriculture and forestry. A simple drive through the Midlands illustrates this. </p><p>By contrast, wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest dominate the north, south, and west areas with annual rainfall over 1000mm. </p><p>Science is clear on these ecosystems: the more disturbance they suffer, the more flammable they become, and the less effective they are at storing water and moderating climate.</p><p>Nor does producing timber on farms, in plantations, or through native forest logging do anything to stop timber imports. </p><p>We already import most house-framing timber - mostly pine - from plantations in New Zealand and South Australia. </p><p>Tropical hardwoods continue to be imported in large volumes, often for use as outdoor furniture.</p><p>Meanwhile, the majority of our domestically produced timber, whether from plantations or native forests, is still used for pulp, the lowest-value outcome.</p><p>If we genuinely want to change this, we should be investing in agroforestry systems with mixed-age, mixed-species diversity and supporting well-managed plantations beyond the private sector. </p><p>Coupled with investment in onshore processing for engineered structural timber products, this could create a higher-value, sustainable timber industry.</p><p>In short, I don't trust the broader farming sector to \"do the right thing\" by native forests, not without much tighter regulations, independent monitoring, and a shared, forward-looking vision for the kind of Tasmania we want to leave to future generations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jenny Cambers-Smith, Crabtree</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patient meal deliveries</emphasis></p><p>AS AN ex LGH employee, I hope you keep the kitchen on-site cooking going. </p><p>I now live in Wagga Wagga due to family reasons and spend much time in the local public hospital with my sister, who can't fault the nursing care, but they went with the cook-chill method. </p><p>The food is unappealing to sick people, all tastes the same, but it's convenient to the hospital. </p><p>No washing up, but heaps of landfill. </p><p>Please don't go down this road. The private hospital in Wagga Wagga still cooks all meals on site. </p><p>Tasmania, think hard about this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denise Blyth, Wagga Wagga NSW</emphasis></p><p>Giving land away</p><p>I EXPECT most Launcestonians have no idea how large the property at 2 Invermay Rd actually is. Well, part of this is 21.26 hectares, a large parcel of land, I'm sure you would agree.</p><p>The City of Launceston is about to divide this into two lots, though not evenly.</p><p>They intend to give, yes you read that correctly, give 5.16 hectares to Stadiums Tasmania, the new owners of York Park.</p><p>City of Launceston will retain ownership of 16.1 hectares, maybe until they decide to give that away, slyly, like this lot.</p><p>I expect they caught this bug from a former Government who gave away large tracts of land to new settlers.</p><p>Oh well, I suppose Stadiums Tasmania is still fairly new.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ron Baines, Kings Meadows</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump's tariffs</emphasis></p><p>TARIFFS now being implemented by President Trump on multiple countries across the world are now being seen by many economists as being possible to cause extremely severe economic recessions in the many countries, including Australia.</p><p>Surely it must be possible for chosen with care delegates of the extremely concerned countries to meet as a combined group with President Trump, as a matter of urgency, in an effort to bring some sanity back to world economic affairs.</p><p>A continuing talk worry fest will not solve the tariff problem. </p><p>In my opinion only a meeting between Donald Trump, the man who initiated this terrible problem, and world delegates has a chance of avoiding a world economic mess of considerable proportions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Measday, Kingswood SA</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dumb decisions</emphasis></p><p>ELON Musk has called Peter Navarro Trump's trade adviser \"dumber than a sack of bricks\".</p><p>Musk the so-called genius (was that from Trump?) has just realised he is not a car manufacturer but a car assembler. </p><p>And where do the parts for his cars come from? Um ... err... China.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">J.

The Kenyan government has pledged to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.treasury.go.ke/national-tree-planting-intiative-launch/\">plant 15 billion trees by 2032</url> to increase forest cover in the country <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.reset.org/jazamiti-kenyas-digital-leap-towards-15-billion-new-trees/#:%7E:text=The%20government%20intends%20to%20plant,plant%20trees%20across%20the%20country.\">to 30%</url>. It has also urged <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.esi-africa.com/news/kenya-pledges-to-plant-15-billion-trees-across-the-country-by-2032/\">every Kenyan to plant at least 50 trees</url> in cities, degraded rural areas, and on farms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Including trees in smallholder farming systems is particularly important, given the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2022.100489\">central role</url> of farming in Kenya's economy and small farms' vulnerability to climate change. One promising approach is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldagroforestry.org/about/agroforestry\">agroforestry</url>, a farming approach where trees, shrubs and crops are planted together to <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-019-0589-8\">enhance soil fertility, boost biodiversity and improve farmer livelihoods</url>. For example, in Kenya, smallholder farmers often grow maize and beans alongside fruit trees such as mango and avocado. <url normalizedValue=\"https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/4382e70c-f27a-4c1a-9ebc-0ee9a52f0a8b/content\">Trees also provide</url> fodder for animals and <url normalizedValue=\"https://eos.com/blog/nitrogen-fixation/#:%7E:text=Nitrogen%20fixation%20is%20a%20process,crops%20and%20support%20their%20growth.\">fix nitrogen</url> in the soil as a nutrient for plants. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Trees can make farms more sustainable - here's how to help farmers plant more</emphasis></p><p>Tree diversity makes landscapes more resilient to pests, diseases and changes in the climate. When an area has many different trees, these provide a habitat for a wider range of wildlife such as pollinating insects and birds. To create more sustainable, thriving landscapes that benefit both people and the planet, tree  diversity should be a central part of restoration efforts.</p><p>Yet, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721002767\">many tree planting projects focus</url>  on the number of trees planted rather than the diversity of species. For example, Kenya's 15-billion-tree initiative has made little information available on how many different types of trees are being planted and how they are chosen.</p><p>We are conservation scientists who study how people and nature interact, exploring the connections between ecosystems, biodiversity and human behaviour. We interviewed 620 smallholder farmers in <url normalizedValue=\"https://vihiga.go.ke/#:%7E:text=The%20County's%20population%20stands%20at,606%2C044%20by%20the%20year%202022\">Vihiga County</url>, western Kenya, to understand their approach to tree diversity and find out if this could be increased on their farms. Vihiga county is one of Kenya's most densely populated areas, with a population of 590,013 people living on 531km\u00b2 of land.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Plant diversity makes West Africa's shea trees bear more fruit</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10774\">Our research found</url> that  farmers were very interested in growing a wider variety of trees on their farms. But their decision-making was influenced by several factors, including their past experiences, other farmers' opinions, and their relative wealth. </p><p>Targeted support, such as farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange or providing farmers with direct financial incentives, could help scale up agroforestry in ways that <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-019-0589-8\">benefit people and nature</url>. Support from government extension services, non-governmental organisations and farmer cooperatives is particularly important. Simply planting monocultures (one species) of fast-growing trees won't restore biodiversity or support local livelihoods.</p><h>Barriers to tree diversity</h><p>Many farms in Kenya<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666719324001523\">are dominated by a few tree species</url> alongside their main crops maize and beans - particularly fast-growing exotic tree species like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eucalyptus</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Grevillea robusta</emphasis>. Farmers often choose these species because <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/forests-and-global-change/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2021.773170/full\">they grow quickly, providing fuel and timber</url>. </p><p>But with most farms being less than an acre in size, every tree competes with space for food crops. One farmer told us that she would love to plant more trees for firewood and fruit, but worried that these would take up the space for her crops, which her livelihood depends on. </p><p>Our results also showed that some farmers feared that trees might have negative effects on their crops. This had been the case with eucalyptus, which can deplete soil nutrients and water. These experiences left some hesitant to experiment with new tree species.</p><p>Others worried that more trees would attract unwanted wildlife, particularly crop-raiding animals such as monkeys and rodents, and insects that could be pests. Farmers also spoke about the time and knowledge required to maintain trees properly. Agroforestry is not as simple as planting a seedling and waiting for it to grow. It requires careful selection of the right species, knowledge of how they interact with crops, and long-term management.</p><h>Making tree planting work for farmers and nature</h><p>Despite these barriers, <url normalizedValue=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10774\">our research also identified</url> that farmers could be motivated to plant trees. Farmers who had previously planted trees, or had seen their peers do so, were more likely to increase the tree diversity on their farms. Peer-to-peer learning could be a valuable tool for increasing tree diversity in farming landscapes.</p><p>We also found that farmers with higher education levels (such as a diploma or university degree) and higher incomes were more inclined to experiment with tree planting. This could be because farmers with <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-023-00885-5\">higher education levels</url> may have greater awareness of agroforestry benefits and better access to training or extension services. This might make them more open to experimenting with diverse tree species. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Industrial scale farming is flawed: what ecologically-friendly farming practices could look like in Africa</emphasis></p><p>Similarly, higher-income farmers might be able to more easily afford the upfront costs of tree planting. However, we also found that farmers who relied entirely on agriculture for their livelihoods were interested in expanding the variety of trees on their farms.</p><h>Designing tree-planting initiatives</h><p>Our research findings indicate that tree-planting initiatives should not be designed in a top-down manner. They must be tailored to local needs. These initiatives should address farmers' worries, such as the risk of attracting wildlife or trees depleting scarce water supplies. </p><p>Governments could help by consulting farmers to find out what kinds of trees are useful for them before buying millions of seedlings. Locally run nurseries could make native species more accessible. Community-based training could equip farmers with the knowledge they need to integrate trees effectively. Without the right support, farmers remain trapped in a cycle of soil degradation and declining yields.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: What to consider before mass planting of trees in Nigeria's Lagos State</emphasis></p><p>Initiatives like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.diversityforrestoration.org/\">Diversity for Restoration</url> (D4R) and <url normalizedValue=\"https://myfarmtrees.org/\">My Farm Trees</url> are already taking steps in this direction. These programmes support farmers by providing diverse tree seedlings, offering training, and using digital tools to track tree growth. If there were more projects such as these, that would help ensure that tree planting supports biodiversity, restores landscapes, and sustains the livelihoods of those who depend on them. </p><p>For tree planting initiatives to truly benefit people and nature, they must be designed with farmers at the centre - not just as recipients, but as guardians and active decision-makers shaping the future of their landscapes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ennia Bosshard receives funding from the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT for her PhD research at the University of Exeter.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAFR-249518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAFR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F6N-PPB3-RS1T-D4FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463585</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1157\"/><timeReceived>2:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Africa</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7045\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 25, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Initiative &amp;

This will further progress understanding of ecosystem services and market-based approaches which will enable stakeholders to access and compare global studies on the environmental and socio-economic outcomes of offshore wind farm developments.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>July 23: Quadruple success for University of Aberdeen in latest RSE funding awards</p><p>Four 'exceptional' research projects from the University of Aberdeen have been successful in the spring 2025 RSE Research Awards open call.</p><p>The University won a share of more than the Pound0.75 million awarded by the RSE to 73 research projects across the sector.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

This phased implementation, targeting completion by 2028, is expected to enhance operational efficiency and scalability. While short-term cash flows may be pressured due to the significant capital and operational expenditure, the long-term benefits include cost reduction, improved decision-making, and sustained competitiveness. Execution risks such as delays or cost overruns remain critical factors for investor monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion in China Through Evirth Acquisition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The Q4 2024 acquisition of Evirth (Shanghai) Industrial Co., Ltd added $201 million in net revenues during the first half of 2025, strengthening the company's footprint in China's cakes and pastries market. This move aligns with the strategy to diversify regional portfolios and drive growth in the AMEA region. While integration costs and contingent adjustments may present near-term margin challenges, this acquisition supports long-term value creation by tapping into a high-growth consumer segment.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pension Risk Reduction Enhances Stability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The buy-out conversion of the Mondelez Global LLC Retirement Plan in June 2025 transferred pension liabilities to third-party insurers. Although this decision incurred a $282 million non-cash pretax settlement loss, it eliminates long-term pension liabilities, improving financial stability. While the settlement loss diluted Q2 2025 earnings, this proactive risk management decision strengthens the balance sheet and instills confidence in future fiscal health.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividend Increase Reflects Confidence in Cash Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;A 6% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, declared in July 2025, underscores management's confidence in sustained cash flow. This move enhances shareholder returns, making the stock attractive to income-focused investors. However, the potential impact on capital reinvestment opportunities should earnings growth slow is a consideration. The consistent dividend policy reinforces investor confidence in the company's ability to deliver long-term value.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined Portfolio Through JDE Peet's Divestiture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The Q4 2024 sale of 85.9 million shares in JDE Peet's follows a (EURO)612 million impairment charge earlier in 2024. By reducing its exposure to this volatile equity investment, the company is sharpening its focus on core operations. Although the impairment charge weighed on 2024 earnings, reallocating capital from non-core assets positions the company to deploy resources more strategically. Investors should remain attentive to how this decision drives future growth initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing Market Presence in High-Risk Regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Despite suspending new capital investments and advertising, the company continues its operations in Russia, contributing 4.0% of net revenue in Q2 2025. Above-average profitability in this region bolsters near-term earnings, yet geopolitical risks, such as asset expropriation or sanctions, pose long-term uncertainties. Management's commitment to ensuring food supply continuity reflects a balanced approach. However, investors should weigh the region's revenue contribution against potential stability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Resilience in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The resumption of production at Ukrainian facilities in Q2 2024 restored operations in a region accounting for 0.4% of Q2 2025 net revenue. This commitment to leveraging existing capacity amid conflict underscores the company's operational resilience. Although geopolitical risks persist, the restoration supports revenue stabilization in European markets. Investors should monitor ongoing developments for potential disruptions to operational continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Transparency Amid Hyperinflation in Argentina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Beginning Q1 2024, the exclusion of extreme pricing in Argentina from non-GAAP metrics aims to improve the comparability of Organic Net Revenue and other performance indicators. This change offers investors a clearer interpretation of underlying business performance, albeit at the cost of masking some economic realities. Investors should consider this adjustment alongside existing currency-related risks to maintain a comprehensive perspective on emerging market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completion of Simplify to Grow Program Bolsters Margins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The Q4 2024 conclusion of the Simplify to Grow Program marks the elimination of restructuring costs, driving cost efficiency and improving 2025 margins. This effort reflects management's focus on streamlined operations, which contributes to stronger profitability. While any revisions to liability estimates could impact earnings, the program's success emphasizes a commitment to operational discipline-a positive signal for investors seeking sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded Financing Capacity for Strategic Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The December 2024 increase in long-term financing authorization to $4 billion, with $2.4 billion remaining as of mid-2025, equips the company with added liquidity for acquisitions, share buybacks, and capital expenditure. This strategic positioning enhances growth potential but also raises leverage concerns, evidenced by a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.44 in Q2 2025. Investors should monitor debt management to ensure it aligns with long-term financial health and value creation.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>SECTION 7 BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>7.1 Price/Earnings of 18.3 &gt; Consumer Non-Durables sector (of 12 stocks) avg of 16.7:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 16.7.</p><p>7.2 Downtrend</p><p>Price/Moving Average Price of 0.96 and negative MACD:</p><p>- The Price/MAP 200 for Mondelez International is 0.96.

Whether it's research, mental health, education or just better communication, I love that psychology offers a foundation for understanding the world around us.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 02: University of Aberdeen: Researchers sequence first genome from ancient Egypt</p><p>A University of Aberdeen archaeologist has contributed to research which has extracted and sequenced the oldest Egyptian DNA to date from an individual who lived around 4,500 to 4,800 years ago, the age of the first pyramids, in research published today in Nature.1</p><p>Forty years after Nobel Prize winner Svante Paabo's pioneering attempts to extract ancient DNA from individuals from ancient Egypt, improvements in technology have now paved the way for the breakthrough, led by the Francis Crick Institute and Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), which is also the first whole genome (the entire set of DNA in an individual) from ancient Egypt.2</p><p>During this period of ancient Egyptian history, archaeological evidence has suggested trade and cultural connections existed with the Fertile Crescent - an area of West Asia encompassing modern-day Iraq, Iran and Jordan, among other countries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 02: University of Aberdeen: Pound5.6million project launched to explore how man-made structures affect our seas</p><p>The University of Aberdeen will partner in a new research project set to transform how offshore structures are managed across their full lifecycle.</p><p>University researchers will work alongside a range of institutions from across the UK and in Norway on the Pound5.6 million initiative, which will be led by Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML).</p><p>The ValMAS (Value of Marine Artificial Structures) project is a major new research effort to understand the full impact of man-made structures in the ocean, ranging from offshore oil, gas and wind energy infrastructure to shipwrecks. These are collectively known as marine artificial structures (MAS).</p><p>The project, which will focus on the North Sea with wider applicability across the UK and beyond, aims to create tools and evidence that will help decision-makers manage these structures in ways that support clean energy, protect nature, and benefit society.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 01: University of Aberdeen: Graduating is more than just an academic achievement for Ashraq - it is a deeply emotional milestone</p><p>Ashraq AlFaraj's PhD journey tested her in every way possible - during her six and a half years at the University she got married, had two children and dealt with the stress of a seriously ill baby during a global pandemic.</p><p>But she says her difficult path to success has shaped her as a person and that she will 'always look back on it with strength and gratitude'.</p><p>Ashraq first came to Aberdeen in 2017, attracted by the institution's strong reputation in geological sciences and supported by a scholarship from the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research to study for a PhD in Petroleum Geology/Geochemistry.</p><p>She said: \"When I began my academic journey at the University of Aberdeen, life brought me two incredible blessings - I got married and welcomed my first baby while studying abroad. It was a beautiful milestone that brightened my path, but as an international student, it was far from easy. \"In my second year, my daughter was diagnosed with a heart condition and underwent open-heart surgery - a deeply emotional and challenging time. Shortly after, the world was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, and like many others, I faced additional stress from my sponsor, ongoing medical concerns, and the uncertainties of global disruption.</p><p>PermID: 5000465583</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-23072518130037870001104622</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB5-BGW3-RTCC-50BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to MondelezInternationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports MondelezInternationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

If we start putting timber into the lands that have been degraded think of all the carbon we will be storing,\" he said.</p><p>\"We will be doing more against climate change than any other party if we really get into this.\" Dr Collins said crime in Cairns was also why he was a part-time security guard, and he supported Castle Law.</p><p>\"I have heard so many sad stories about families who have been broken into and it does a lot of damage to our families,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is why I've gone with the Katter Party because Castle Law has to come in, people need to have the right to defend themselves in their home.\" Dr Collins lives in Edmonton and said he had spent most of his life in the Far North.</p><p>\"I've been kicking around in the forest or up in The Cape, I know the place,\" he said.
