As a research center and archives of historical documents of the recent past, the Cold War, dictatorships, human rights struggles, as well as mass atrocities against human rights, the Archivum, although part of a private university, essentially performs a public service. From the outset, Istvan strived to ensure the widest possible open access to the collections, so that through the publication and mobilization of documents, the Archivum could function as a catalyst and promoter of democratic development after the fall of Socialist one-party systems, and thus as a cultural institution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>July 14: CEU's Summer University Celebrates 30 Years</p><p>SUN began in 1996 with a mission to enhance higher education in the countries of the former Soviet bloc, as well as in Eastern and Central Europe.

Her book, \"The Birth of Energy: Fossil Fuels, Thermodynamics, and the Politics of Work\" (Duke, 2019), was awarded the Clay Morgan Award for best book in environmental political theory. It argues that only by transforming the politics of work - most notably, the veneration of waged work - will we be able to confront the Anthropocene's energy problem.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>April 01: Central European University: Cultivating Women in Leadership</p><p>On March 6, CEU students Lulin Han and Dominga Meneses, recipients of the CIVICA Student Engagement Fund, traveled to IE University in Madrid, Spain, for the ninth annual Women's Leadership Conference, organized by IE's Women in Business Club.

Defra now faces the unenviable task of signing and monitoring thousands of new ELM agreements with fewer staff and shrinking data resources. Without the capacity to check whether fields really have become richer in skylarks or streams clearer of fertiliser, large sums could be delayed or misdirected.</p><p>Scale is another challenge. An independent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/Scale%2520of%2520Need%2520Report%2520July%25202024%2520FINAL.pdf\">analysis</url> published in 2024 estimated that roughly \u00a36 billion every year across the UK is needed to bring agriculture in line with the Environment Act targets for habitat restoration and net zero commitments. </p><p>Even the full \u00a32 billion promised for England would meet only about half of that evidence-based need. And the \"up to\" \u00a3400 million for trees and peatlands is not new money: it is funding that was first promised in 2024 and the payment schedule has still not been confirmed.</p><p>While the review earmarked \u00a34.2 billion for flood and coastal defence, it does not specify how much of that will support <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nature-based-solutions-adaption-report.pdf\">nature-based measures</url> such as floodplain restoration, or the creation of saltmarshes or riparian woodlands. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://consult.defra.gov.uk/floods-and-water/reforming-our-approach-to-floods-funding/consultation/subpage.2025-05-14.5263259024/\">Environment Agency is consulting</url> on a funding model that could embed such solutions, but the Treasury papers are silent on who will pay for that shift.</p><h>Tech spending dwarfs habitat investment</h><p>Contrast this with the sums heading to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. </p><p>Roughly \u00a330 billion is earmarked for nuclear fission, fusion research and carbon-capture hubs. These projects are heavy on concrete and steel (materials with a hefty carbon cost) but have no immediate ecological benefit.</p><p>While new low-carbon technologies are crucial, thriving and resilient soils, wetlands and woodlands nourish food systems, safeguard water and hold vast stores of carbon - benefits that deepen and become more cost-effective over time.</p><p>Nature-based solutions can also <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000281\">revitalise local economies</url>. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/uknaturalcapitalaccounts/2024\">Office for National Statistics</url> estimates that replacing the benefits flowing from the UK's forests, rivers and soils - flood buffering, crop pollination, cleaner air, recreation and more - would cost about \u00a31.8 trillion, a figure that only hints at their deeper, immeasurable value. </p><p>Yet the review sets out no plan to safeguard these life-support systems, or to factor their decline into the Treasury's green book (the rule book used to appraise public investments) or the Bank of England's stress tests, which check how shocks could ripple through the financial system.</p><p>This is also a matter of fairness and public health. Growing evidence shows that regular contact with nature lowers the risks of <url normalizedValue=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35181451/\">heart disease</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829222001587?via=ihub\">anxiety</url>, while improving <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1503402112\">children's cognitive development</url>. These are benefits with a value that defies any price tag. </p><p>Yet the places with the fewest trees and parks tend to be the same post-industrial towns ministers want to \"level up\". The review is silent on biodiversity net gain (the flagship policy meant to channel private finance into local habitats) and on a proposed national nature wealth fund that could blend public and private capital for large-scale restoration.</p><h>Housing money could repeat past mistakes</h><p>One line in the spending review could still shift the balance. </p><p>The chancellor has earmarked \u00a339 billion for building social and affordable housing over the next decade. If every development delivers at least a 10% net gain for biodiversity onsite, and if schemes build in climate-smart design (living roofs, shade-giving street trees, permeable surfaces) with local residents, Britain could pioneer the world's first large-scale, nature-positive, net-zero housing programme. </p><p>Without those safeguards, \"levelling up\" risks repeating old mistakes: sealing green space under concrete today and paying tomorrow to retrofit drainage, shade and parks.</p><p>That risk is heightened by the government's planning and infrastructure bill, now before parliament. In an open letter to MPs, economists and ecologists warn that the bill would let developers \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/24/planning-bill-would-allow-builders-to-pay-cash-to-trash-nature-say-uk-experts\">pay cash to trash</url>\" irreplaceable habitats by swapping onsite protection for a levy, a move they describe as a \"licence to kill nature\".</p><p>At the next UN climate summit, Cop30 in Brazil in November 2025, the UK will have to show the world that its domestic spending matches its international rhetoric. </p><p>More than 150 UK researchers made that point in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/news/leading-uk-scientists-urge-prime-minister-to-place-nature-at-the-centre-of-economic-and-climate-policy/\">open letter</url> to the prime minister, urging him to put nature at the centre of the UK's Cop30 stance. Converting the Treasury's headline figures into habitat gains and locking robust rules into both the planning bill and the housing drive would give ministers credible proof of progress when they update the UK's climate and nature pledges on the Cop30 stage.</p><p>The spending review may have nudged farm policy in the right direction and set a new higher water mark for nature-positive agriculture. Yet amid the squeeze on Defra, the recycling rather than expansion of tree and peat budgets and the continued dominance of technology over habitat, nature still comes a distant second to hard infrastructure in the UK growth model.</p><p>There is still time to change course. Guaranteeing Defra's capacity, publishing a timetable for the tree-and-peat fund, reserving part of the flood budget for community-led nature-based solutions and hardwiring strong biodiversity net gain rules into housing and planning reforms would turn headline promises into projects that enrich daily life while stewarding public money wisely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Get a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

This means more landscape change and development of supporting infrastructure. Ecosystems are under pressure, made worse by natural disasters induced by climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, governments, scientists and environmentalists are turning their attention to <url normalizedValue=\"https://iucn.org/our-work/nature-based-solutions#:%7E:text=Nature%2Dbased%20Solutions%20address%20societal,nature%20at%20the%20same%20time.\">nature-based solutions</url>. These are environmental strategies that aim to address environmental damage, including the impact of disasters, climate change, and water and food insecurity. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For example, wetlands are a natural resource for humans and create a habitat for wildlife. They filter water and control floods.  But they've been degraded all over the world, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/wetlands-do-the-job-of-expensive-technology-if-we-let-them-125452\">threatens biodiversity and human livelihoods</url>. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ramsar.org/sites/default/files/documents/library/factsheet_wetland_restoration_general_e_0.pdf\">Wetland restoration</url> is a nature-based solution. Other examples are <url normalizedValue=\"https://saforesttrust.com/\">reforestation</url>, and setting up <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/green-infrastructure\">green infrastructure</url> in cities, such as urban forests and roof gardens.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Humans can work with nature to solve big environmental problems - but there's no quick fix</emphasis></p><p>Nature-based solutions are taking off all over the world. In Kenya, about 8,000 <url normalizedValue=\"https://mikokopamoja.org/\">mangrove or coastal forests</url> are being restored every year. These shield communities who live on the coast from storms, and absorb large amounts of greenhouse gases. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/great-green-wall/\">Great Green Wall</url> landscape restoration initiative in Africa's Sahel region is also a nature-based solution. </p><p>In China, 30 pilot \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837717306130\">sponge cities</url>\"  have been set up.

Engineers with the skills to design green infrastructure, and environmental scientists who oversee environmental and social impact assessments, are in short supply. Nature-based solutions can't be set up without them.</p><p>Until now, universities have not offered specific degrees in this field. And there are very few professional training courses for ecologists and scientists.

She is interested in questions that lie at the nexus of human well-being, science, technology, and the more-than-human world. Her work often draws upon feminist approaches to power in order to understand how global warming emerged, as well as how it might be mitigated. Her book, \"The Birth of Energy: Fossil Fuels, Thermodynamics, and the Politics of Work\" (Duke, 2019), was awarded the Clay Morgan Award for best book in environmental political theory. It argues that only by transforming the politics of work - most notably, the veneration of waged work - will we be able to confront the Anthropocene's energy problem.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>April 01: Central European University: Cultivating Women in Leadership</p><p>On March 6, CEU students Lulin Han and Dominga Meneses, recipients of the CIVICA Student Engagement Fund, traveled to IE University in Madrid, Spain, for the ninth annual Women's Leadership Conference, organized by IE's Women in Business Club.

Wharton Trust.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   NATURE CONSERVANCY: NEW GLOBAL EFFORTS TO MAP AND MONITOR KELP FORESTS EXTEND TO SOUTH AFRICA AND NAMIBIA</p><p>These submerged forests sway with the currents, providing a critical habitat for abalone, West Coast rock lobster, leopard catsharks and other marine life while supporting fisheries, tourism and recreation, and they have deep cultural significance for different Indigenous communities around the world.</p><p>Until recently, our understanding of the health of these underwater forests has depended upon our ability to get out into the ocean to observe them directly, a process that-while incredibly valuable-is time-intensive, expensive and limits our ability to track kelp forests over larger scales. Now, with the development of a method that classifies kelp canopy on the ocean's surface from satellite imagery, scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) have brought us an entirely new view of these amazing ecosystems.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-25072520321778130953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBK-M0W3-S4J3-Y3FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2168\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

But a groundbreaking study from Yale University highlights a powerful, low-tech climate solution at work in the mountains of Romania, and its engineers weigh over a thousand pounds: the European bison.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The research confirms that reintroducing this keystone species actively transforms the landscape into a more effective carbon sink, demonstrating that nature-based solutions can be a critical complement to our technological efforts. The Surprising Science of a 'Mosaic' Landscape</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The study, led by Professor Oswald Schmitz of the Yale School of the Environment, centers on the concept of \"trophic rewilding.\" The key is not just the presence of bison, but their behavior. By grazing heavily, they create a dynamic and varied \"mosaic landscape\"-a patchwork of grasslands, scrub, and forests-rather than allowing a uniform, dense forest to dominate.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 YALE UNIVERSITY TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 2 YALE UNIVERSITY PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 1 YALE UNIVERSITY TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"432\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Name</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Designation</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stephen C.

But not every ecological project counts as a nature-based solution. Some projects only bring about a slight improvement to the environment, while others even cover up environmental damage. Cornelius Okello and Timothy A. Downing research climate change adaptation and development. They discussed their latest research into nature-based solutions with The Conversation Africa.</emphasis></p><h>What are nature-based solutions?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nature-based solutions are inspired by nature or use nature to address problems in society. These problems include food and water shortages, poor health, and environmental degradation. Nature-based solutions bring about benefits to biodiversity (the wellbeing of the environment) and human wellbeing. </p><p>Their intention is to acknowledge nature's role in the economy and society, and include nature as a participant in finding ways to repair environmental damage.</p><p>They've been embraced by international policymakers and funders as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/resolutions-treaties-and-decisions/UN-Environment-Assembly-5-2\">model approach</url> for addressing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undrr.org/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/en0008\">biodiversity loss</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Urban greening in Africa will help to build climate resilience -- planners and governments need to work with nature</emphasis></p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://iucn.org\">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</url> has created <url normalizedValue=\"https://iucn.org/our-work/topic/iucn-global-standard-nature-based-solutions\">a global standard</url> that projects must meet <url normalizedValue=\"https://iucn.org/our-work/nature-based-solutions\">in order to qualify</url>.</p><p>A nature-based solution must show that it has led to an increase in the number of plant or animal species in an area. This enhances the natural balance among organisms and their environment. It also has to show that it is based on local conditions (rather than a one size fits all blueprint). Nature-based solutions must involve local communities, include Indigenous knowledge and make sure that the most disadvantaged people in the area benefit from the solution. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Planting trees can help the climate, but only if we also stop burning fossil fuels</emphasis></p><p>Where benefits to the environment may lead to unintended harms to people, a nature-based solution must monitor and address these harms as soon as they occur and include safeguards to protect local communities. </p><p>It must also promote <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/adaptive-management\">adaptive management</url> based on rigorous science. This means that scientists and environmentalists must continually learn from mistakes and use these lessons to improve the nature-based solution. </p><h>Why are they considered to be a solution?</h><p>Nature-based solutions use the power of ecosystems to solve problems that are <url normalizedValue=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2020-020-En.pdf\">intertwined with nature</url>. For example, food security, water security, human health, economic and social development, environmental degradation, climate change, and natural disasters are problems which cannot be solved without involving nature. </p><p>This re-framing of how problems should be solved is empowering. The nature-based solutions concept suggests that environmental problems caused by humans can be solved - and that the solutions exist in nature. </p><p>Nature-based approaches are also often more cost-effective because they use locally available materials. They're less likely to create additional environmental problems. For example, urban greening projects are not expensive to implement. They bring tangible benefits to cities without negative repercussions.</p><h>What are their shortcomings?</h><p>Few projects meet the <url normalizedValue=\"https://iucn.org/our-work/topic/iucn-global-standard-nature-based-solutions\">global standard</url> set by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772411524000454\">our research looked into</url> projects in savanna ecosystems in Africa that addressed land degradation, food and water security, and resource scarcity. But we found that there is not yet enough evidence to show that these projects comprehensively restore the continent's savanna grasslands. </p><p>In another research project, we <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772411524000636\">investigated</url> whether nature-based solutions could help conserve water supplies for the 200 million people who live in Africa's arid and semi-arid lands. These water scarce areas cover 66% of the continent.</p><p>In these areas, initiatives have been set up to improve soil quality, harvest water, and start <url normalizedValue=\"https://arcosnetwork.org/?p=13310\">agroforestry</url> (where food crops are planted with trees, saving water needed for irrigation). Our research found that these kinds of interventions are successful, or not, largely depending on their design and how they are implemented.</p><p>We think a clear understanding of nature-based solutions is important. Otherwise, policymakers and project funders may support any project that claims to be a nature-based solution. </p><p>Nature-based solutions may even become oversimplified approaches to complex issues.</p><p>For example, a small tree-planting project that a corporation may implement to improve its image. This opens the door for potential \"greenwashing\" - when a wide variety of projects can claim to be solving environmental problems with natural solutions, even when this is not true.</p><h>Where have nature-based solutions worked?</h><p>Innovative activities have been implemented in Africa with some success. For example, sustainable <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/biofuel\">biofuel</url> projects and attempts <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciwaprogram.org/blog/mfundo-macanda-developing-climate-smart-agriculture-in-the-eastern-cape/#:%7E:text=To%20develop%20inclusive%20and%20sustainable,throughout%20Southern%20Africa%20until%20the\">to make agriculture resilient</url> to changing climate. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X23000785\">Paying communities incentives</url> to conserve natural land is another example.</p><p>These projects have been successful on a small scale throughout Africa but do not meet all the criteria of a nature-based solution.</p><p>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ccardesa.org/zai-pits\">za\u00ef pits</url> are meant to be a nature-based solution that restores damaged grassland and improves soil for farming. They conserve water and create habitats for termites. The termites <url normalizedValue=\"https://annalsmicrobiology.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1007/s13213-019-1439-2.pdf\">improve the soil</url> by breaking down plant matter and digging holes that allow rainwater to seep into the ground.</p><p>Za\u00ef pits have a basis in nature and they use Indigenous knowledge and locally available material. However, researchers do not yet know if they will be able to support grassland restoration over the long term, or if they might negatively affect other species. They are labour-intensive to set up, and therefore it is unlikely that they'll be established on a large enough scale to reduce global climate change.</p><p>This raises the question: can a nature-based solution be small enough to suit the local context but large enough to address global problems sustainably? </p><p>We concluded that perhaps nature-based solutions are a contradiction in terms. However, they force a discussion that would otherwise be lacking about who benefits from environmental \"solutions\" projects and who loses, at what social and ecological cost, and with what implications for the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The authors would like to thank Yvonne Wambui Githiora, who co-wrote this article and the original research, and Professors Daniel Olago and Margaret Owuor for their reviews.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Timothy A.

For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cifor-icraf.org/publications/downloads/Publications/PDFS/pp08305.pdf\">agroforestry</url> - growing trees alongside crops on the same land - helped boost harvests in Ethiopia by up to 30%.

But they're underfunded, still need money to grow and require more research into how they can be expanded across sub-Saharan Africa.

In the northern region of <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113187\">Ethiopia</url>, terracing (building step-like structures on slopes) worked well to reduce rainwater from running off. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Green skills to help nature repair itself are scarce: what we're doing to train more experts in South Africa and Senegal</emphasis></p><p>In Kenya's semi-arid areas, farming that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10452\">mimics natural ecosystems</url> has enhanced the soil's ability to hold more water, helping crops survive prolonged dry spells.

It cannot be a top-down promotion of new technologies because adapting agriculture to climate change isn't just about new tools or techniques. It is also about women, youth, and marginalised groups such as people living with disabilities having equal access to resources, training and decision-making. Without this, even the best ideas may fail to take root.</p><p>International donors have initiated climate-smart agriculture projects in various sub-Saharan African nations. But most are struggling because they do not fit well with local needs. For instance, projects often overlook indigenous knowledge, ignore local land ownership customs, or introduce technologies that are too expensive or labour-intensive for smallholder farmers.</p><h>Why the G20 must act</h><p>So what can be done about it?

A nature-based solution is proposed that takes advantage of the invasive plant species to produce silage. To facilitate the adoption of this technology, we employ a participatory approach in which fuzzy cognitive maps are used to enhance adaptation to local conditions and future implementation. We perform focus groups and face-to-face interviews with 312 people.

Currently, more than 14,000 plant species have developed outside their origin in a natural manner (Pysek et al., 2017). Owing to climate change, ecosystems are more fragile and prone to invasion. This is aggravated by the fact that invasive plants impoverish ecosystems, causing a negative feedback loop (Bolpagni, 2021; Gaertner et al., 2014). In addition to the environmental challenges, these species cause direct problems for humans related to agricultural production, health and well-being (Shackleton, Shackleton, &amp; Kull, 2019). On balance, invasive species pose an increasingly important challenge, which can only be addressed by assuming the complex nature of the systems they affect (Sullivan &amp; York, 2021). Moreover, the United Nations declared 2021\u20132030 the ecosystem restoration decade, and coping with invasive species is one of the main issues in this regard.</p><p>Traditional control efforts to either slow down invasion or minimize its impact include chemical (herbiciding), mechanical (i.e., cutting or pulling up) and physical (i.e., prescribed burning or solarization) means. These measures are highly expensive since they must be applied in large areas, and scientists wonder whether eradicating or controlling invasion under limited budgets is better (Adams &amp; Setterfield, 2015). In addition to the high cost of control measures, expected outcomes are often uncertain and only noticeable in the long term, which raises the challenge of their implementation (Weidlich et al., 2020). This has led to most traditional control programs being unsuccessful (Dawkins &amp; Esiobu, 2016). This trend has increased in developing countries because they lack the means to address invasive species effectively. Moreover, models suggest that, under no control scenarios, nonnative plants will spread rapidly, mainly due to climate and land-use changes (Vicente et al., 2013). All of these factors make it imperative to develop innovative measures to control invasive plants.</p><p>In this paper, we analyze an \u201ceradication by utilization\u201d control approach, as introduced by Tessema (2012). The core idea is that, giving economic value to invasive plants, the population would be incentivized to harvest them. We focus on the invasive cattail (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Typha</emphasis> spp.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">)</emphasis>, a genus of semiaquatic perennial plants that has ravaged northern Nigerian wetlands, resulting in flooding, disease propagation and a reduction in agricultural yields (Ayeni et al., 2019). The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Typha</emphasis> project1 proposes the use of the biomass of this invasive plant to produce silage2 and thus obtain a new feed resource for livestock that can be stocked and used during the dry season and drought episodes, when feed is scarce. This silage has proven to be a good alternative to low-quality forages, although further research is needed to increase its nutritive value (de Evan et al., 2023). Notably, livestock production accounts for 30% of the added agricultural value in West African Sahel (Godde et al., 2021), and during dry spells herders struggle to feed their animals (Traore et al., 2020). Furthermore, climate change, together with the increase in livestock herds and agricultural land expansion, is meant to put more pressure on limited feeding resources (Brottem &amp; Brooks, 2018; Faye et al., 2022). In this way, cattail-based silage is an opportunity that can be exploited to increase the pool of feeding resources.</p><p>Despite the efforts of local governments and international organizations, the adoption of novel technologies in developing countries remains low (Ruzzante, Labarta, &amp; Bilton, 2021). Furthermore, the innovative and disruptive nature of the proposal, together with the complexity of the problem to be solved, makes it imperative to propose innovative methodologies to involve stakeholders and make them part of the solution. Participatory approaches are becoming increasingly important in various fields of knowledge, but it is even more relevant in the field of adoption of technologies related to agriculture and the environment (Luj\u00e1n Soto et al., 2021).</p><p>The objective of this paper is to analyze the perceptions of stakeholders dealing with the adoption of silage to identify the main barriers and drivers they might cope with and the potential effects that adoption could have on social, health, food and economic aspects. In this way, this article presents the application of a participatory approach that seeks to involve stakeholders from the outset, paying special attention to gender and collective action issues, which have proven to be key aspects of social-ecological challenges (Cohen et al., 2016; Sullivan &amp; York, 2021). To do so, a fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) approach (Kosko, 1994; \u00d6zesmi &amp; \u00d6zesmi, 2003) is used to relate the variables involved in the problem and the solution of the cattail invasion through the development and adoption of the novel cattail biomass-based silage.</p><p>The spread of invasive species poses a serious threat, particularly in developing countries where resources are limited. This work contributes to the literature with an innovative case study of \u201ceradication by use\u201d and demonstrates how the involvement of potential beneficiaries is crucial for guiding and developing nature-based solutions, defined as \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits\u201d (IUCN, 2020). We propose the application of FCM to analyze the impact of a double-dividend technology (increasing drought resilience while reducing the impact of an invasive plant) on local livelihoods. We also adopt a participatory approach, regarding a relevant but little explored issue, in a highly vulnerable area of a developing country, with substantial illiteracy rates. Finally, we focus on gender differences in technology adoption, which constitutes a major knowledge gap when considering capacities to adapt and innovate (Sullivan &amp; York, 2021). On the one hand, we intend to show how participatory approaches, followed by FCM to disentangle complex systems, can be carried out in developing countries. On the other hand, the results from the FCM provide useful insights for successful scale-up plans and reveal the potential impact that cattail-based silage could have on the invasion, the economy and livelihoods, as perceived by stakeholders.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 highlights the impact of the cattail invasion on the case study, covers the context of livestock activities in West Africa and the challenges it faces, describes the data collection and preprocessing, and shows the methodological approach followed to construct the FCM. Section 3 reports the results of the FCM under different scenarios, and Section 4 discusses the results and proposes policies that should be considered for future successful scale-up plans. Finally, Section 5 concludes.</p><h>Materials and Methods</h><h>Case Study</h><p>The irrigation schemes in northern Nigeria, particularly in the Hadejia-Nguru Wetlands (HNW), have been significantly impacted by the proliferation of invasive plants. In recent decades, the colonization of the invasive cattail has led to increased flooding, the spread of diseases, and a decline in agricultural yields (Ahmed et al., 2018). The HNW area is located in the Sahel zone of Nigeria (Figure 1) and covers approximately 8000 km2. These wetlands provide work to approximately 1.5 million farmers, herders and fishermen (Ayeni et al., 2019), and they also have high importance in terms of biodiversity conservation, as many migratory birds use them as breeding grounds (Takekawa et al., 2015).Figure 1.Location of Hadejia Valley in Nigeria (Source: Typha Project website).</p><p>With respect to livestock rearing, 46% of households in Hadejia Valley are involved in cattle production, and 42% are involved in small ruminant (sheep and goats) production (FMWR &amp; World Bank, 2017). During the dry season (September-May), many herders abandon Hadejia Valley and migrate in search of pastures. Climate change has already affected grazing lands (Stanimirova et al., 2019), and it is expected that rangeland net primary productivity will decrease 42% by 2050 under RCP4.5 and 46% under RCP8.5 in western sub-Saharan countries (Trisos et al., 2022).</p><p>Furthermore, conflicts between farmers and herders are becoming increasingly important due to the increasing scarcity of resources provoked by the expansion of the agricultural frontier and climate change (Brottem, 2020). The growing presence of terrorism in the area is also altering transhumance patterns, putting more pressure on scarce pastures (George et al., 2022) and leading Nigerian grazing lands to suffer the tragedy of the commons (Aderinto et al., 2020). As a further factor to be considered, the number of herds is expected to increase because of population growth and rising incomes. This, together with the fact that the available surface will dwindle due to desertification and variations in precipitation and temperature, will increase the challenge of feeding the animals. In this context, increasing fodder resources could improve livestock production (Mertz et al., 2010).</p><h>Participatory Approach and FCM</h><p>Our methodological approach is based on participatory research, also known as action research. According to Vaughn and Jacquez (2020), \u201cparticipatory research encompasses research designs, methods, and frameworks that use systematic inquiry use in direct collaboration with those affected by an issue being studied for the purpose of action or change.\u201d This research-to-action approach encourages horizontal interaction among researchers and stakeholders in the technology design and adoption process, integrating local scientific knowledge and reducing power imbalances (Cornwall &amp; Jewkes, 1995; Luj\u00e1n Soto et al., 2021).</p><p>In this way, bottom-up ideas are generated, and stakeholders are more easily motivated to apply what they have learned. Therefore, participatory approaches have two benefits. It generates knowledge that can be used by policymakers when designing strategies to foster technology adoption (bottom-up ideas), and it makes implementation easier since stakeholders have been considered during the whole process (social learning). This approach will encourage stakeholders to adopt the technology more readily, thereby enabling more effective control of cattail expansion.</p><p>The participatory approach was performed through a FCM, a causal qualitative graphical representation of the dynamics in a system on the basis of the understanding of individuals, which may include local or expert knowledge (\u00d6zesmi &amp; \u00d6zesmi, 2003). These graphs contain concepts or factors depicted by boxes, which are linked by arrows representing their causal relationships. The intensity of connections can range from \u22121 to 1, where negative (positive) values represent negative (positive) causal effects. The higher the absolute value is, the greater the causal relationship will be, with values close to zero indicating weak causality. The FCM is an adequate tool for identifying the main dimensions of the agroecosystem in relation to the project\u2019s objective as perceived by the potential beneficiaries, discovering drivers, barriers and impacts of the adoption of cattail-based silage, and the relationships among them.</p><p>This methodology is increasingly being used to model social\u2012ecological relationships and potential outcomes of ecosystem restoration and conservation programs (Baker et al., 2018; Gray et al., 2017; Hunter et al., 2015). It is a helpful method for modeling systems in which resilience has to be increased (Johnson et al., 2012) to ease adaptation and mitigate potential risks (Devisscher, Boyd, &amp; Malhi, 2016). It has also been applied to analyze climate-smart technology adoption (Luj\u00e1n Soto et al., 2021). In addition, this approach permits the consideration of qualitative data and simulation of dynamic systems as opposed to traditional statistical methods, which makes it especially valuable when there is a lack of information (Hossain &amp; Brooks, 2008), as in many developing countries. However, most of the studies focus on high-income regions, and developing countries remain clearly underrepresented in the FCM literature. This could be because of the complexity of eliciting stakeholders\u2019 opinions in these regions.</p><h>Data Collection</h><p>Normally, a FCM is built directly by stakeholders, but in this case, owing to the large number of people involved and their limited formal education, the process was set up in four stages. As a kick-off, the project was presented to the stakeholders during an inception workshop. In the second step, after sharing information with stakeholders on the project, 7 focus groups were formed, 3 with women and 4 with men, separated by gender because of cultural traditions. The focus groups were conducted with the help of trained local partners with semi-structured and open questions about their livestock activities and the perceived benefits and main concerns regarding the adoption of cattail-based silage. A balanced composition of participants by gender was intentionally pursued, and 31 women and 38 men participated. In the third step, based on the results of the focus groups, a face-to-face questionnaire was designed and conducted for men and women in the same household. Sample selection was random from a representative list provided by the water authority among eight local communities but restricted to those households engaged in livestock activities. A total of 168 men and 144 women between 18 and 68 years old were interviewed. The collected data were subsequently used to construct the FCM.</p><h>FCM Development Process</h><p>The map was exclusively built on stakeholders\u2019 perceptions. For this purpose, the influencing variables and their causal relationships were identified from the focus groups and questionnaire results, respectively. The intensity of the relationships was estimated on the basis of a Likert scale. In this way, an intensity equal to unity would be produced if all the individuals gave the highest importance to that fact, and an intensity equal to 0.5 could be either because all the individuals gave it a medium importance or because half of the individuals gave it a maximum importance and the other half a null importance. Equation (1) shows how the intensity of the relationship was calculated. The adjacency matrix is built on the basis of the intensities and the causal relationships.(1)I=\u2211j=04jNj4Nwhere:j = The score of the Likert scale (0, 1, 2, 3 or 4)Nj = Number of people who selected option j</p><p>The FCMs were constructed separately for women and men to consider gender issues. We aggregated the maps based on Banini and Bearman (1998), where the aggregated FCM is obtained by weighting, both by the number of respondents in each group (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>) and by the decisional weight of each group (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>) (see Equation (2) and (3)).(2)EC=\u2211i=1I\u03c0i\u2009Ei(3)\u03c0i=piniN\u2211i=1IpiniNwhere <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis> represents the total number of respondents, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> represents the aggregated adjacency matrix and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> represents the adjacency matrix for group <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>. Based on a question dealing with the power to make important decisions, we determined decisional weights of 2/3 and 1/3 for men and women, respectively. Figure 2 shows the methodological flowchart.Figure 2.Methodological flowchart.</p><h>FCM Analysis</h><p>First, typical FCM analysis metrics such as the density, indegree and outdegree values, and centrality are studied as proposed in \u00d6zesmi and \u00d6zesmi (2003). The clustering coefficient or the density of the FCM is an index that explains the degree of connectivity of the variables. The higher the density of the map is, the greater the connections between the variables, which may be interpreted as a catalyst for change (\u00d6zesmi &amp; \u00d6zesmi, 2004). The outdegree value [od(vi)] represents the cumulative strength of factors exiting the variable, whereas the indegree value [id(vi)] represents the cumulative strength of factors entering the considered variable. The variables can be classified according to their indegree and outdegree values into 3 categories: transmitter variables (od &gt; 0 and id = 0), receiver variables (od = 0 and id &gt; 0) and ordinary variables (od &gt; 0 and id &gt; 0). The transmitter variables may be interpreted as barriers or drivers of the system, and the receiver variables may explain the impact that other variables provoke. Having many receiver variables is an indicative of the complexity of the map, and transmitter variables indicate that top-down influences exist (Eden et al., 1992). Finally, the centrality (ci) of a variable is the sum of the outdegree and indegree values and reflects its importance in the system.</p><p>FCMs are a great tool for performing scenarios and testing how a certain action or policy might affect the system (Kok, 2009). We build the scenarios by multiplying the adjacency matrix by a state vector <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis> (unity vector in this case) over multiple iterations <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t,</emphasis> as performed in Ballesteros-Olza et al. (2022). We use the activation rule with self-memory (equation (4)) for the iteration process based on Kosko (1994) and modified by Stylios and Groumpos (2004).(4)Aj(t+1)=f(k1,i\u2211i=1i\u2260jIAitwi,j+k2,jAjt)where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t+1</emphasis> is the value of concept <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> at iteration <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t+1</emphasis>; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis> is a threshold function; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> is the value of concept <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> at iteration <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>; wi,j is the weight of the causal connection between concepts <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>; and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> is the value of concept <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> at iteration <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t. k</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">1</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis> are two coefficients that must be between 0 and 1 and may differ for each concept. The selection of these coefficients depends on the nature of the concept. Following Kosko (1994), we assume <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">1</emphasis> = 1 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis> = 0 for every concept. We use the sigmoid threshold function as in Solana-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. (2017) (equation (5)).(5)f(x)=11+e\u2212\u03bbxwhere \u03bb is a positive number that determines the steepness of the function. We set its value to 1, as in Ballesteros-Olza et al. (2022).</p><p>We perform 3 different analyses of the FCM: (1) We study the aggregated FCM considering the hypothetical scenario where cattail silage exists and compare it with the current situation in which stakeholders do not take advantage of this resource. We do this by eliminating the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cattail silage adoption</emphasis> variable. In this way, we simulate a hypothetical scenario where cattail silage can be produced and adopted and compare it to the current state of the system or baseline scenario. (2) We also analyze gender differences, and (3) we perform both positive and negative scenarios. In the negative scenario, we fix the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cattail invasion</emphasis> variable to 0.9 (based on stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of the increase in the cattail population in the last 10\u201320 years). In the positive scenario, we simulate that a program fostering collective action in harvesting and preparing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Typha</emphasis>-based silage is implemented (we fix the C<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ollective action</emphasis> variable to 0.9).</p><h>Results</h><h>Baseline Scenario: With and Without Cattail Silage</h><p>Figure 3 presents the aggregated FCM, and Figure 4 presents the steady-state values of the system after convergence with and without the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cattail silage adoption</emphasis> variable. These results reveal that cattail silage technology incentivizes weeding (+0.12 compared with the current situation). However, the results of the reduction in the cattail population are more modest (\u22120.02).Figure 3.Aggregated fuzzy cognitive map. The blue (red) lines represent positive (negative) connections, and the numbers represent the intensity of that connection.Figure 4.Steady-state values of the system with and without cattail silage.</p><p>The expected outcome for livestock activities is much stronger (+0.15). Moreover, the two main constraints to livestock activities, feed cost and feed nonavailability, would be reduced by 0.19 and 0.20, respectively. During the focus groups, many stakeholders argued that during the dry season or in dry spells, feed nonavailability is the main concern. Even if they had enough money to buy feed, they would not have the possibility to buy it because of its scarcity.</p><p>An increase in the feeding resources pool would reduce the degree of conflict between farmers and herders (\u22120.22). In addition, stakeholders perceived that this new technology could generate new business opportunities related to its value chain (+0.15). Many participants in the focus groups, especially the most vulnerable ones (women and youth), highlighted that they intended to produce silage to sell it.</p><p>Table 1 shows a summary of the main indices of the aggregated FCM when cattail silage is adopted. The high number of connections per concept (1.9) indicates that there are many relationships between variables, which may be interpreted as an indicator that the system is easily modifiable, as stakeholders\u2019 options have more impact (\u00d6zesmi &amp; \u00d6zesmi, 2003).Table 1.Indices of the Aggregated Fuzzy Cognitive Map.</p><p>Figure 5 summarizes the importance of each concept according to the outdegree and indegree values. The variables related to cattail (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cattail silage adoptio</emphasis>n and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cattail population)</emphasis> are the most central variables, followed by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Livestock activities</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Collective action</emphasis> (also known as social capital), which includes aspects such as membership in organizations, feeling of togetherness or trusting others, stands out as a highly relevant concept. In our study, more than 2/3 of the sample declared that they belonged to at least one organization, and 85% of the respondents stated that the feeling of togetherness in the village or neighborhood was \u201cvery close\u201d.Figure 5.Outdegree and indegree values for each concept in the aggregated map.</p><p>In the middle of the ranking, we find variables related to the impact of cattail invasion (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crop yield</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Feed non availability</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Feed cost</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Grazing resources</emphasis>) and concerns that may constrain the adoption of silage, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Time and effort to harvest/make silage</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Limited know-how</emphasis>. Indeed, during the focus groups, stakeholders were worried about not being able to produce quality silage and the possible ill effects it could have on the animals. Furthermore, some interviewees underscored that the presence of poisonous reptiles amidst the weed could deter the collection of cattail.</p><h>Gender Differences</h><p>Concepts in the gender-based FCMs were similar except for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Use for construction</emphasis> variable, which was not mentioned by women. However, the intensity of some connections varied substantially. The objective of this subsection is to test which gender is more sensitive to the effects of the cattail invasion, on whom more efforts should be made to foster adoption and what are the effects of the cattail silage on the system according to men and women. Figure 6 shows the difference in the steady-state values for the gender-based FCMs with and without the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cattail silage adoption</emphasis>.Figure 6.Differences in the steady-state values of the gender-based FCMs with and without adoption.</p><p>Compared with men, women are more aware of the detrimental effects of cattail invasion (i.e., diseases and the effects of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Typha</emphasis> invasion on grazing resources and crop yield). However, they are more skeptical regarding the reduction of the cattail population and conflicts between farmers and herders accomplished by the introduction of this new practice. This could be because women, in general, stay at home and do not know exactly the dynamics of this clash.</p><p>Currently, men are the ones in charge of weeding, but the introduction of cattail silage could lead women to become involved in silage preparation and even its commercialization. With respect to concerns related to the adoption of the technology, women feel that time and effort to harvest and make silage would be a greater barrier to adoption. In terms of the positive impact of silage on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Livestock activities</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Feed cost</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Feed non availability</emphasis> are greater for women, who are, in general, in charge of small ruminants. Moreover, this new technology is seen as a new business opportunity, mostly by women, who suffer greater unemployment rates.</p><h>Scenario Analysis</h><p>In the negative scenario, we perform a model simulation under the assumption that the invasion persists or accelerates, driven by factors such as climate change or human activities. The model reached stationarity after 20 interactions. Figure 7 shows the relative changes in the values of the variables between this scenario and the baseline scenario shown in Figure 4. The variables on which the increase in encroachment would have the greatest effect are those directly affected by the cattail population, according to stakeholders, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crop yield</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Block waterways</emphasis>. However, if silage is available and people adopt it, the impact of an increase in the level of invasion will be minor (i.e., all the differences are smaller in absolute value).Figure 7.Differences between the negative scenario (Cattail invasion variable is set to 0.9) and the baseline scenario considering that adoption does exist, and that adoption does not exist.</p><p>In the positive scenario, we simulate the impact of increasing collective action regarding the adoption of silage and its possible effects. This could be achieved by holding workshops, conducting demonstrations on how to make the silage or regarding the positive impact this product can have. In this scenario, we set the value of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Collective action</emphasis> to 0.9. Figure 8 illustrates the relative changes in the values of the variables between the positive scenario and the baseline scenario shown in Figure 4.Figure 8.Differences between the positive scenario (Collective action is set to 0.9) and the neutral scenario in which adoption is not fostered by increasing collective action.</p><p>When collective action is promoted, the main concerns that diminish the adoption of silage (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Time and effort to harvest/make silage</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Limited know-how</emphasis>) are reduced, increasing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cattail silage adoption</emphasis> compared with the baseline scenario. We see that the adoption of silage enhances the variables related to livestock activities, feeding the animals and it reduces the degree of conflict between farmers and herders. However, the stakeholders feel that the impact on the cattail population would not be as high as desirable.</p><h>Discussion</h><p>The FCM analysis indicates that stakeholders have doubts regarding the efficacy of adopting silage to diminish the proliferation of the invasive cattail, primarily due to its extensive spatial occupancy and rapid growth and reproductive rates, but they consider it to have a buffer effect and mitigate its impact in critical areas. The skepticism related to the ecological restoration effect stands in contrast to the optimism surrounding the potential benefits that cattail silage could confer upon the livestock sector. Introducing a novel source of feed into the available resource pool has the potential to alleviate resource scarcity during the dry season or droughts, events that pose significant threats to livestock activities and food security. Consequently, animals could be better nourished, thereby avoiding weight loss, which would enable farmers to refrain from selling them prematurely. This, together with decreasing mortality rates, could prevent herders from falling into a poverty trap (Carter &amp; Barrett, 2006). Given that nearly half of the population in Hadejia Valley is engaged in livestock rearing, the overarching impact of cattail-based silage on local communities could be substantial.</p><p>As a consequence of increasing the feed resource pool, herders would not be forced to migrate to unexplored unstable areas. Furthermore, the adoption of silage would render herders somewhat less reliant on weather conditions and afford them greater flexibility in determining the commencement of transhumance. As a result, livestock would be less inclined to encroach upon unharvested croplands, thereby potentially mitigating conflicts between farmers and herders. In fact, Nnaji et al. (2022) highlight the need to foster new practices and technologies to address this conflict.</p><p>Cattail silage value chain encompasses various stages, including plant harvesting, transportation, processing, and storage. Notably, new product value chains can increase development in low-income areas (Olmedo, van Twuijver, &amp; O\u2019Shaughnessy, 2021). Each of these stages presents opportunities for the development of new businesses, particularly for groups facing challenges in accessing the current labor market, such as women and young people. Hence, it is imperative to furnish these groups with appropriate infrastructure and tailored tools to facilitate their engagement in these activities. For example, distributing smaller bags designed to accommodate the physical characteristics of women could stimulate adoption. This approach aligns economic development in the region with the enhancement of living conditions for vulnerable groups.</p><p>However, none of the benefits will materialize unless a substantial portion of the population adopts this technology. Constraints related to limited expertise, potential adverse effects on animals, and the effort involved in preparing silage emerge as primary factors that could undermine adoption. To avoid these issues, organizing workshops and demonstrations that illustrate the process of producing quality silage efficiently can serve as an effective solution to promote adoption. Moreover, experimental collaborations with farmers could be conducted to demonstrate that silage has no detrimental effects on animals. In addition, to reduce the time and effort required to harvest or make silage, public administrations or donors could subsidize the purchase of the machinery necessary (i.e., shredding machines) to carry out the process efficiently. Weeding tools customized for this plant and designed to minimize the threat to poisonous reptiles should also be developed and subsidized.</p><p>These initiatives could be channeled through local organizations. In fact, many studies highlight the importance of social capital in sub-Saharan Africa (Kansanga et al., 2020), and it has proven to be an opportunity to enhance adaptation to climate variability in this region (Ombogoh et al., 2018). For instance, workshops and demonstrations could be hosted in these organizations. Primarily, a small group could be trained, and at a second stage, they could act as information disseminators. Moreover, to foster vulnerable groups\u2019 entrepreneurship, in addition to targeted information and workshops on how to prepare silage bags, subsidies could be provided for the purchase of material by organizations and subsequently shared by their members. In this way, the total cost would be lower, and information dissemination could be increased.</p><p>Furthermore, leveraging social capital can serve as a catalyst for synergies between herders and farmers. For example, herders could contribute to the eradication of cattail from areas adjacent to croplands and facilitate large-scale ensiling processes directly in the fields. During the dry season, herders could utilize these fields, which are situated near water sources, to provide silage for their animals while simultaneously fertilizing the land. This reciprocal arrangement would afford herders access to both water and animal feed, while farmers benefit from the clearance of cattail and natural fertilization of their fields.</p><h>Conclusion</h><p>Fighting invasive species is a persistent struggle in many developing countries. Moreover, climate change, in addition to its own consequences regarding food security or the increase in the probability of extreme events such as droughts, is accelerating their spread and impact. On another note, livestock activities are key to the survival of millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. Drought events, the expansion of the agricultural frontier, and conflicts are putting more pressure on the availability of grazing lands, resulting in a lack of feed for livestock. All these factors make it necessary to introduce new practices to increase the availability of feed. Our work contributed to the literature through a participatory approach in an innovative case study on \u201ceradication by use\u201d that can provide valuable guidelines for other areas in developing regions.</p><p>In this work, we focused on Hadejia Valley (northern Nigeria), which has been ravaged by invasive cattail (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Typha</emphasis> spp.). We assessed stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of an innovative \u201ceradication by use\u201d approach based on the adoption of a cattail-based silage to feed livestock during the dry season. In this way, stakeholders would be incentivized to weed the cattail, reducing its population while increasing the feed resource pool. To analyze the potential impact of this technology, we suggested a participatory approach and built a fuzzy cognitive map that considers the perceptions of 312 stakeholders. This approach is especially valuable for engaging them and underpin the adoption of new practices. We proposed a way to implement this approach in vulnerable areas with high illiteracy rates by dividing the process into 4 stages.</p><p>The stakeholders perceived that this double-dividend technology could reduce the feed cost, improve livestock production, and reduce the conflict between farmers and herders while mitigating the population of the invasive plant. Women were more skeptical about its benefits and had major concerns that could undermine the adoption of silage. However, they perceived that it could be an opportunity to develop new businesses related to its value chain. Therefore, to unleash the full potential of this technology, it is necessary to carry out gender-based policies to reduce skepticism. Moreover, strong social capital and collective action could be used to promote information. To this end, local organizations could act as information sharing hubs, holding workshops and demonstrations, for example. In addition, gender specificities should be considered in a scale-up program through demonstrations and information.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link to PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"10117710704965251324620\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"61903\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Adams V.

Yet beneath the surface of these seemingly straightforward arrangements lies a complex web of competing priorities, stakeholder interests, and financial considerations that can make or break a project's success.</p><p>As construction managers at the center of these negotiations, we've witnessed firsthand how the delicate balance between public facility investment and private team ownership creates both opportunities and challenges that extend far beyond traditional project delivery. The key to success lies not just in managing budgets and timelines, but in understanding how to align divergent stakeholder priorities while maximizing return on investment for all parties involved.</p><p>The Market-Size Dynamic One of the most significant factors influencing PPPs in sports infrastructure is market size, and this relationship often defies conventional wisdom. Smaller markets have demonstrated remarkable leverage in accessing public dollars, while larger markets face increasingly skeptical taxpayers and political environments that demand greater private investment from wealthy franchise owners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    SCRIPPS CLINIC FOUNDATION [2 Press Releases in Week 33]</p><p>DASHBOARD: SCRIPPS CLINIC FOUNDATION</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"464\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">PermID</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5000413396</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Website</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scripps.org\">http://www.scripps.org</url></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Industry</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Construction</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>+    Week 33 of 2025 - Press release 1 of 2 Aug 11, 2025:</p><p>SCRIPPS CLINIC FOUNDATION: SCRIPPS SKIN CANCER SURGEON SHARES INSIGHTS WITH NEWSWEEK</p><p>Newsweek magazine interviewed Hubert Greenway, MD, for a story about skin cancer prevention and early detection.

Vitamin D - often called \"the sunshine vitamin\" - is an essential nutrient for good health. Your body produces it when your skin is exposed to UVB rays from sunlight. Despite its natural source, many people don't get enough, which can lead to a deficiency that affects bones, muscles, mood and more.</p><p>Vitamin D plays several critical roles. It helps your body absorb calcium and maintain phosphorus levels. Both are vital for keeping your bones strong and healthy.</p><p>This important vitamin also supports your immune system and is linked to a lower risk of chronic conditions, including heart disease and diabetes. Yet, despite its importance, studies show more than 40% of Americans have vitamin D levels below what many experts consider optimal for overall health, and about 1 in 4 have levels considered deficient.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    TLT (N.I.)

That is the concern of an interdisciplinary research project at Heidelberg University, located at the interface of chemistry, physics and AI research. The goal of the project \"Quantum Chemistry without Orbitals\" is to forecast the properties of much more complex systems than has as yet been possible. The project was initiated by Prof. Dr Fred Hamprecht and Prof. Dr Andreas Dreuw from the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing and Prof. Dr Maurits W. Haverkort from the Institute for Theoretical Physics. The Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung has allocated more than 745,000 euros to fund the research work for a period of two years.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HEIDELBERGER BRUCKE: CLIMATE ACTION IN TIMES OF GLOBAL CRISES AND SOCIAL UPHEAVALS</p><p>Environmental science colloquium features online and in-person events Action to mitigate climate change in times of global crises and upheavals in society will be addressed at the colloquium \"Heidelberger Brucke\" taking place in the 2025 summer semester.

A new study by University of Oxford researchers, published in Nature, reveals that the pressure to sleep arises from a build-up of electrical stress in the tiny energy generators inside brain cells.</p><p>The discovery offers a physical explanation for the biological drive to sleep and could reshape how scientists think about sleep, ageing, and neurological disease.</p><p>Led by Professor Gero Miesenbock from the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics (DPAG), and Dr Raffaele Sarnataro at Oxford's Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, the team found that sleep is triggered by the brain's response to a subtle form of energy imbalance. The key lies in mitochondria - microscopic structures inside cells that use oxygen to convert food into energy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   JOINT DONATION TO OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE OVERCOME BARRIERS AND SUCCEED IN STEM</p><p>The University of Oxford has received a Pound6.25 million gift to expand its outreach work with socio-economically disadvantaged students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.</p><p>The gift will help to fund three major outreach projects taking place at the University from October 2025. These include a new programme providing GCSE mathematics mentoring to students who show promise for the subject, and an innovative 'online school' that gives 14-19-year-olds the opportunity to learn maths and physics at a deep level.</p><p>Together, they will support disadvantaged students starting their GCSEs right through to those finishing their first year at Oxford, with each programme designed to address specific challenges these students experience when choosing to study STEM subjects.</p><p>The donor, who has opted to remain anonymous, has also made a gift to the University of Cambridge to support projects aimed at increasing participation and attainment in STEM subjects. While the programmes will be administered separately, the universities will work together - sharing online resources and materials, as well as academic tutors - to ensure maximum impact for participating students.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD NEW 50M MRC CENTRE LAUNCHED TO STUDY HOW ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES CAUSE CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES</p><p>A new Medical Research Council Centre of Research Excellence (MRC CoRE) will investigate how the environment interacts with our immune system to trigger chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><p>Chronic inflammation-related diseases have been estimated to cause over half of all deaths worldwide, so unlocking the processes behind these diseases is crucial to saving lives through developing better prevention and treatments.</p><p>The MRC CoRE in Exposome Immunology will receive up to Pound50 million over 14 years, leveraging the combined strength of teams at The University of Oxford and The University of Manchester in immunology, big data, and environmental science.</p><p>The 'exposome' describes the many environmental factors a person encounters throughout their life, ranging from pollution and occupational hazards to diet and infectious diseases. This has a huge impact on health and wellbeing, with an estimated 30,000 deaths attributed to air pollution every year in the UK, and increasing rates of inflammatory diseases in children. However, very little is known about the mechanisms by which the exposome causes disease.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-210725193657980005670326104950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G9R-JV33-RTBR-93XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1467\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

A smorgasbord of everything from Italian squash to cucumbers, okra, watermelon, blueberries and beets.</p><p>That success in repurposing food scraps, paper towels, pizza boxes and coffee grounds feeds her hope that her program launched in 2023 germinates its replication elsewhere for a more sustainable workplace environment.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH IGNITEX ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SELECTS STARTUPS FOCUSED ON PROJECT EXECUTION INNOVATIONS</p><p>Carrying out increasingly complex infrastructure projects often means fending off challenges as diverse as they are common: rising costs, scope creep and poor communication quickly come to mind.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

But a groundbreaking study from Yale University highlights a powerful, low-tech climate solution at work in the mountains of Romania, and its engineers weigh over a thousand pounds: the European bison.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The research confirms that reintroducing this keystone species actively transforms the landscape into a more effective carbon sink, demonstrating that nature-based solutions can be a critical complement to our technological efforts. The Surprising Science of a 'Mosaic' Landscape</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The study, led by Professor Oswald Schmitz of the Yale School of the Environment, centers on the concept of \"trophic rewilding.\" The key is not just the presence of bison, but their behavior. By grazing heavily, they create a dynamic and varied \"mosaic landscape\"-a patchwork of grasslands, scrub, and forests-rather than allowing a uniform, dense forest to dominate.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 YALE UNIVERSITY TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 2 YALE UNIVERSITY PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 4 YALE UNIVERSITY: DEMOGRAPHY</p><p>SECTION 1 YALE UNIVERSITY TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"432\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Name</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Designation</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stephen C.

Trump cited New Delhi's continued imports of Russian oil as the reason behind this newest measure, sharply escalating tensions between the two countries after months of negotiations over a possible limited trade agreement fell through.</p><p>The new tariffs on some Indian goods would be among the steepest faced by any U.S. trading partner. Trade analysts warned the tariffs could severely disrupt Indian exports, according to Reuters. The president's order says the additional 25% tariff will go into effect 21 days after the previously-announced 25% tariff, which was set to take hold Aug. 7.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Yale University: Summer picks: Where do our early childhood memories go? podcast</p><p>It's a mystery that has long puzzled researchers.

Sure, art can be beautiful or moving. But philosophers and psychologists have been arguing that it can do something else, too: teach us.</p><p>In a recent talk at Yale University, Dr. Eileen Cardillo, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania, presented the latest research providing insights about how this happens. Bringing Ourselves into the Experience of Art</p><p>The first research lesson is that art's power to inform and enlighten isn't just about the artwork itself. Instead, the viewer plays an essential role.</p><p>To examine what makes art memorable, researchers asked art viewers to reflect on experiences with art and describe aloud what the art they remembered looked like, where they were when they saw it, how they felt, and what else they thought about. From the responses, the team gleaned that memorable art experiences are marked by intense concentration, awareness of a variety of bodily sensations, and people making connections to personal experiences or events from their lives.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 4 YALE UNIVERSITY: DEMOGRAPHY</p><p>4.1 Employees Demography</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"392\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gender</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Percentage</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Men</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">52</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Women</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">48</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-10082519241737890001102869</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GG1-B7P3-RWFF-C17T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2140\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

But a groundbreaking study from Yale University highlights a powerful, low-tech climate solution at work in the mountains of Romania, and its engineers weigh over a thousand pounds: the European bison.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The research confirms that reintroducing this keystone species actively transforms the landscape into a more effective carbon sink, demonstrating that nature-based solutions can be a critical complement to our technological efforts. The Surprising Science of a 'Mosaic' Landscape</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The study, led by Professor Oswald Schmitz of the Yale School of the Environment, centers on the concept of \"trophic rewilding.\" The key is not just the presence of bison, but their behavior. By grazing heavily, they create a dynamic and varied \"mosaic landscape\"-a patchwork of grasslands, scrub, and forests-rather than allowing a uniform, dense forest to dominate.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 YALE UNIVERSITY TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 2 YALE UNIVERSITY PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 4 YALE UNIVERSITY: DEMOGRAPHY</p><p>SECTION 1 YALE UNIVERSITY TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"432\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Name</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Designation</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stephen C.

Trump cited New Delhi's continued imports of Russian oil as the reason behind this newest measure, sharply escalating tensions between the two countries after months of negotiations over a possible limited trade agreement fell through.</p><p>The new tariffs on some Indian goods would be among the steepest faced by any U.S. trading partner. Trade analysts warned the tariffs could severely disrupt Indian exports, according to Reuters. The president's order says the additional 25% tariff will go into effect 21 days after the previously-announced 25% tariff, which was set to take hold Aug. 7.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Yale University: Summer picks: Where do our early childhood memories go? podcast</p><p>It's a mystery that has long puzzled researchers.

Bringing Ourselves into the Experience of Art</p><p>The first research lesson is that art's power to inform and enlighten isn't just about the artwork itself. Instead, the viewer plays an essential role.</p><p>To examine what makes art memorable, researchers asked art viewers to reflect on experiences with art and describe aloud what the art they remembered looked like, where they were when they saw it, how they felt, and what else they thought about. From the responses, the team gleaned that memorable art experiences are marked by intense concentration, awareness of a variety of bodily sensations, and people making connections to personal experiences or events from their lives.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 4 YALE UNIVERSITY: DEMOGRAPHY</p><p>4.1 Employees Demography</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"392\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gender</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Percentage</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Men</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">52</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Women</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">48</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-10082519243637890001102869</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GG1-B7P3-RWFF-C18K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2140\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Jupiter International (Australia) Pty Ltd.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

And with help from her coworkers in Charleston, South Carolina, she's got a composting pile to prove it.</p><p>The resiliency and nature-based solutions engineer's home garden has some of the richest dirt imaginable, courtesy of the workplace composting drive that has taken root.</p><p>With enthusiastic help from officemates, Henneman - an employee-owner of the Kansas-based global human critical infrastructure leader since 2022 - already has collected hundreds of pounds of otherwise landfill-bound throwaways that now nourish her backyard trove. A smorgasbord of everything from Italian squash to cucumbers, okra, watermelon, blueberries and beets.</p><p>That success in repurposing food scraps, paper towels, pizza boxes and coffee grounds feeds her hope that her program launched in 2023 germinates its replication elsewhere for a more sustainable workplace environment.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH IGNITEX ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SELECTS STARTUPS FOCUSED ON PROJECT EXECUTION INNOVATIONS</p><p>Carrying out increasingly complex infrastructure projects often means fending off challenges as diverse as they are common: rising costs, scope creep and poor communication quickly come to mind.

As part of the 12-week program demonstrating the rigor of Black &amp; Veatch's culture of innovation, participants collaborate with the company's subject matter experts who provide consultation and support towards co-developing, piloting and marketing their new technologies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH POWERS THE PHILIPPINES' FIRST MEGAWATT-SCALE FLOATING SOLAR FACILITY</p><p>Black &amp; Veatch, a global leader in human critical infrastructure, has successfully delivered the Philippines' first megawatt-scale floating solar photovoltaic (PV) facility, marking a milestone in renewable energy innovation and sustainable mining practices.</p><p>Commissioned by Carmen Copper Corporation, the 3-hectare floating solar array on Malubog Reservoir features 8,540 solar panels generating up to 4.99 megawatts (MW) of clean energy - enough to meet 10% of the mine's power needs, the first step to meeting the Philippines Department of Energy goals of 35% by 2030.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

And with help from her coworkers in Charleston, South Carolina, she's got a composting pile to prove it.</p><p>The resiliency and nature-based solutions engineer's home garden has some of the richest dirt imaginable, courtesy of the workplace composting drive that has taken root.</p><p>With enthusiastic help from officemates, Henneman - an employee-owner of the Kansas-based global human critical infrastructure leader since 2022 - already has collected hundreds of pounds of otherwise landfill-bound throwaways that now nourish her backyard trove. A smorgasbord of everything from Italian squash to cucumbers, okra, watermelon, blueberries and beets.</p><p>That success in repurposing food scraps, paper towels, pizza boxes and coffee grounds feeds her hope that her program launched in 2023 germinates its replication elsewhere for a more sustainable workplace environment.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH IGNITEX ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SELECTS STARTUPS FOCUSED ON PROJECT EXECUTION INNOVATIONS</p><p>Carrying out increasingly complex infrastructure projects often means fending off challenges as diverse as they are common: rising costs, scope creep and poor communication quickly come to mind.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

And with help from her coworkers in Charleston, South Carolina, she's got a composting pile to prove it.</p><p>The resiliency and nature-based solutions engineer's home garden has some of the richest dirt imaginable, courtesy of the workplace composting drive that has taken root.</p><p>With enthusiastic help from officemates, Henneman - an employee-owner of the Kansas-based global human critical infrastructure leader since 2022 - already has collected hundreds of pounds of otherwise landfill-bound throwaways that now nourish her backyard trove. A smorgasbord of everything from Italian squash to cucumbers, okra, watermelon, blueberries and beets.</p><p>That success in repurposing food scraps, paper towels, pizza boxes and coffee grounds feeds her hope that her program launched in 2023 germinates its replication elsewhere for a more sustainable workplace environment.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH IGNITEX ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SELECTS STARTUPS FOCUSED ON PROJECT EXECUTION INNOVATIONS</p><p>Carrying out increasingly complex infrastructure projects often means fending off challenges as diverse as they are common: rising costs, scope creep and poor communication quickly come to mind.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

A smorgasbord of everything from Italian squash to cucumbers, okra, watermelon, blueberries and beets.</p><p>That success in repurposing food scraps, paper towels, pizza boxes and coffee grounds feeds her hope that her program launched in 2023 germinates its replication elsewhere for a more sustainable workplace environment.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BLACK &amp; VEATCH IGNITEX ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SELECTS STARTUPS FOCUSED ON PROJECT EXECUTION INNOVATIONS</p><p>Carrying out increasingly complex infrastructure projects often means fending off challenges as diverse as they are common: rising costs, scope creep and poor communication quickly come to mind.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently. Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners! Our annual Subcontractor Appreciation Days are eagerly anticipated events held nationwide to honor the skilled professionals we work with, from electricians to drywall experts, and the collaborative projects we accomplish together throughout the year. Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us. Our general contracting business wouldn't be where it is today without the support of our subcontractors. We take pride in the meaningful relationships and trust we have cultivated with our trade partners from coast to coast.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC PUSHING BOUNDARIES WITH ROBOTICS IN CONSTRUCTION</p><p>Robots on construction sites may have once sounded like science fiction, but they're here, and they're working alongside our teams today. From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

based on insights from Australia's wind energy sector, every 50MW of renewable capacity generates approximately 839 direct and indirect jobs annually<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 With AGL targeting 12GW of renewable and firming capacity over the next decade, the report said the company's investment could result in an estimated 201,292 jobs and inject an estimated $59.4 million into regional communities over the next decade.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"AGL's transformation demonstrates the power of civil society, philanthropy, and investors in driving meaningful change,\" the report concluded.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It serves as a compelling example of how collective pressure can drive businesses to align with global climate goals, setting a powerful precedent for similar efforts worldwide.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 AEGN chief Claire O'Rourke says the findings are a celebration of what has been achieved and an urgent call to ramp up philanthropic efforts to deliver positive outcomes for the Australian economy, the environment and future generations.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"People who are members of the Australian Environmental Grantmakers Network know that it's so important to have a thriving economy and a healthy society, and that relies on a healthy environment,\" Ms O'Rourke told AAP.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"And as the technologies are coming into play that allow us to get off fossil fuels, move to a clean energy future and use nature-based solutions to help build our country, we will also help healing our environment.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's by working together, across society, across civil society, across government, that we can actually make a big difference and help put ourselves on a faster and fairer transition to a clean economy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYB-8KG3-RTBM-M1DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><timeReceived>3:33 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Australian Associated Press Pty.

With support from a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/04/23/world-bank-bangladesh-sign-850-million-financing-package-to-create-jobs-boost-trade-modernize-social-protection-system\">US$850 million (\u00a3620 million) investment</url> from the World Bank, engineers are building flood-resistant infrastructure that can survive rising seas and stronger storms. A new 3.7-mile-long barrier will protect people, homes, and trade in one of the world's most climate-vulnerable regions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Projects like this do more than save lives. They show why investing in climate adaptation is one of the smartest financial opportunities of our time. There are plenty of global conferences where leaders discuss climate change and make big promises. Yet, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/09/POV-climate-financing-that-puts-people-first-rania-al-mashat\">less than 5.5% of</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undp.org/romecentre/focus-areas/climate-finance\">global climate finance</url>  actually reaches the countries most at risk. That is not just a failure of fairness. It is a missed chance for real impact.</p><p>As the world gathers in Seville, Spain for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://financing.desa.un.org/ffd4\">fourth international meeting</url> on development financing, the focus must go beyond pledges and shift toward practical, on-the-ground investment in resilience.</p><p>At the previous UN climate finance meeting, also held in Seville, leaders focused on fixing how public money flows through global institutions. But just as important is the need to invest in climate adaptation. This means helping people live with the changes already happening, including more floods, longer droughts, rising seas and intense heat.</p><p>While mitigation is about stopping climate change getting worse (by switching to clean energy or protecting forests that absorb carbon, for example), adaptation is about coping with the effects we can no longer avoid. It includes building stronger homes, growing more resilient crops, and improving hospitals and schools so they can keep working during extreme weather. Both approaches are necessary, but adaptation often gets less attention. And less money.</p><p>Private investors have already committed large sums to clean energy projects. But they have done much less to support communities on the frontlines of climate change. Many of these countries struggle with limited budgets, complex rules for accessing finance, and a lack of support to develop viable projects. So promising ideas often go unfunded.</p><p>That is beginning to change. New tools are helping investors take on less risk and back more projects. These include low-interest loans, partnerships between public and private institutions, and guarantees that reduce the risk of failure. </p><p>The Green Climate Fund is the largest source of dedicated climate finance for developing countries. By the end of 2023, it had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/news/cop28-green-climate-fund-reaches-record-funding-level\">approved US$13.5 billion</url> in funding, rising to US$51.9 billion when co-financing is included. This money helps unlock adaptation efforts that were previously out of reach.</p><p>We can already see progress. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837718314534#:%7E:text=The%2520adoption%2520of%2520stress%252Dtolerant,study%2520is%2520Wossen%2520et%2520al.\">In Kenya and Ethiopia</url>, farmers are using <url normalizedValue=\"https://aiccra.cgiar.org/news/drought-tolerant-crops-provide-relief-smallholder-farmers-kenyas-drylands\">drought-resistant seeds</url> to grow more food in changing conditions. <url normalizedValue=\"https://impactalpha.com/realizing-the-caribbeans-renewable-energy-potential/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">In the Caribbean</url>, solar energy is powering schools and clinics <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/08/latin-america-community-energy-indigenous-lighting-electricity-solar-pollution-diesel-just-transition\">in remote communities</url>. And in Bangladesh, the new port infrastructure in Chittagong is protecting a vital economic hub while boosting local businesses.</p><h>Working with nature</h><p>In coastal areas, restoring mangrove forests can reduce the force of incoming storms, protect biodiversity and support fisheries. The Pollination Group, a climate investment firm, is helping turn \"nature-based solutions\" like these into projects that attract private finance. </p><p>In his previous role as the Prince of Wales, King Charles III launched the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sustainable-markets.org/ncia/\">Natural Capital Investment Alliance</url>, an initiative that aims to mobilise US$10 billion for projects that restore and protect nature while offering solid financial returns. The alliance also helps investors better understand these kinds of opportunities by creating clearer guidance and standards. This supports the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sustainable-markets.org/terra-carta/\">Terra Carta</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/11/prince-charles-businesses-terra-carta-pledge-planet-first-nature-age-of-extinction\">a charter created</url> by King Charles III that offers a roadmap for businesses to align with the needs of both people and the planet by 2030.</p><p>Investors who step into these emerging spaces gain more than financial returns. They build long-term relationships with governments and local communities. They help shape future policy. And they create lasting foundations for growth in places that are ready to lead if given the chance.</p><p>Adaptation projects also bring real benefits to people. They improve access to clean water, protect food supplies, create jobs, strengthen education and support healthcare systems. For families already facing climate disruption, these changes are not just improvements. They are lifelines.</p><p>By creating stable and welcoming environments for responsible investment, governments can accelerate this shift. By simplifying how money is accessed, international institutions can make it easier for good ideas to become funded projects. Philanthropic groups and development agencies can help build local skills and prepare projects for funding. Private investors can bring capital, innovation and experience.</p><p>Investing in climate adaptation is no longer just a moral issue. It is a smart, scalable and necessary response to a changing world. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Get a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

It's the first year Barton Malow has appeared on the publication's annual list, the most recognized listing of solar contractors in the United States that ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry.</p><p>Nationally, more than 50 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the United States in 2024, the largest single year of new capacity added to the grid by any energy technology in over two decades.</p><p>Barton Malow entered the renewable energy market in 2008 and features a resume of projects that also include wind and biomass. Barton Malow has also recently broken ground on more solar projects, such as Coldwater Solar, and more are expected to break ground soon. Barton Malow Canada also has a strong presence in the Canadian solar energy market, notably in Ontario and Alberta.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BARTON MALOW COMPANY RECORD MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK INVESTMENTS MEAN BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS BUILDERS</p><p>Across the country, the landscape of America's pastime is being reshaped. With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.
