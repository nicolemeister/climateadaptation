Rugby fans will have the opportunity to engage with and support the work of ChildFund Rugby, ChildFund's dedicated rugby for development unit, via an opt in mechanism to donate when purchasing match day tickets, with funds raised through the partnership supporting the expansion of rugby for development programmes in Oceania.<br/><br/>World Rugby Chief Executive Alan Gilpin said: \"We are delighted to be extending our impactful association with ChildFund, this time as principal charity partner for Rugby World Cup 2021. The tournament will showcase rugby's unstoppable women as they compete at the highest level.<br/><br/>\"Importantly, it will also generate an incredible legacy by supporting a new generation of female players and leaders in Pacific Island nations through ChildFund's significant contribution to rugby for development programmes in the Oceania region.\"<br/><br/>Through a ground-breaking partnership at RWC 2019, a record-breaking \u00a32 million was pledged by rugby fans globally to ChildFund, providing more than 25,000 children from disadvantaged communities in Asia with the opportunity to take part in ChildFund's Pass It Back programme across Asia, teaching life skills through rugby with the support of Asia Rugby.<br/><br/>Funds raised were also used to support local communities in Japan with the rebuilding effort following the devastation caused by Typhoon Hagibis during the tournament.<br/><br/>ChildFund Rugby's development programmes not only promote the right to play in communities where children have little or no access to organised sport, but provide important learning opportunities around leadership, problem-solving, gender equality, relationships, conflict-resolution, and planning for the future.<br/><br/>With a strong focus on gender equality, a strategic objective shared by World Rugby, more than half of all participants and rugby leadership roles are female, challenging gender stereotypes.<br/><br/>ChildFund Alliance Chair Simon Whyte said: \"ChildFund is excited to again be partnering with World Rugby to change children's lives through sport.<br/><br/>\"Over 31,000 children and young people have benefitted from their involvement in ChildFund's rugby for development programmes, which are highly successful in providing critical learning opportunities for children facing significant challenges linked to poverty and inequality.<br/><br/>\"As part of this, 6,000 children have participated in Reconnect, a COVID-19 early response initiative developed by ChildFund which supports positive responses among young people to the challenges of the pandemic.<br/><br/>\"ChildFund's rugby for development programmes also support global efforts to achieve gender equality, reduce inequality, and end gender-based violence, reflecting targets within the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\"<br/><br/>ChildFund Ambassadors Honey Hireme-Smiler and Emily Chancellor, former and current New Zealand and Australian players, will be on opposing sides when the tournament commences. However, they are on the same team in recognising the importance of organised sport in girls' and boys' lives, particularly in disadvantaged communities.<br/><br/>Hireme-Smiler, former New Zealand Black Fern, said: \"I am extremely passionate about supporting younger girls as this was how we were raised within our whanau (family). The ways in which ChildFund makes an impact on the lives of vulnerable children -- whether through health and wellbeing, education, or sport -- is so inspiring.\"<br/><br/>Wallaroos player Emily Chancellor, who shared her rugby skills with children in Laos in 2019, added: \"ChildFund Rugby's development programmes are incredibly important for young people in developing communities, because they combine education with team sport. Learning through play is a really valuable way to build confidence and resilience.<br/><br/>\"I'm also proud to support an initiative which has such a strong focus on gender equality and is creating an equal playing field for girls and boys alike.\"<br/><br/>Funds raised during the tournament will allow ChildFund Rugby to expand its contribution to rugby for development programmes for children and young people in Oceania, support female leadership initiatives, and support the creation of strong rugby women's networks around the globe.<br/><br/>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of World Rugby.<br/><br/>For more information, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ChildFundRugby.org\">www.ChildFundRugby.org</url><br/><br/>Media Contact:<br/><br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Douglas.Langley@worldrugby.org\">Douglas.Langley@worldrugby.org</email><br/><br/>+353 87 067 8599<br/><br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Rugby@APO-opa.com\">Rugby@APO-opa.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2PW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2PW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62S7-TGV1-JD3Y-Y4KG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162367</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M2 PressWIRE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21233\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 26, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There was no immediate confirmation of the figures from authorities.</p><p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who had been scheduled to leave Monday for the United Nations General Assembly, will delay his trip by a day to check on damage from the storm, his office confirmed.</p><p>Officials from the Japan Meteorological Agency warned that in Miyazaki prefecture, where some areas saw more rainfall in 24 hours than they normally receive in all of September, river levels were high.\u00a0</p><p>\"Even a tiny amount of additional rainfall could cause the water level to increase, so please remain vigilant about flooding and landslides,\" Yoshiyuki Toyoguchi from the land ministry told reporters.\u00a0</p><p>Still, given the intensity of the storm, which came ashore packing gusts of up to 234 kilometres an hour, damage appeared relatively limited so far.</p><p>\"The typhoon has all but disappeared today and the rain and wind are also subsiding now,\" an official in charge of crisis management in Miyazaki's Saito city told AFP.</p><p>\"But power is out in some places...we're also hearing from many residents that electrical wires have been severed and trees have been toppled,\" he said, declining to be named.</p><p>\"Flooding is affecting some areas as well,\" he added, saying that officials \"believe there are still many details of the damage we're yet to grasp\".</p><p>Rare \"special warnings\" for Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures, issued only when weather events seen every few decades are forecast, have been downgraded.</p><p>But evacuation warnings of various levels remained in place for 9.6 million people on the last day of a holiday weekend in Japan.</p><p>The warnings are not mandatory, and authorities have at times struggled to convince residents to leave their homes during extreme weather events.</p><p>In the town of Izumi in Kagoshima prefecture, 30-year-old Yasuta Yamaguchi spent the night in a local hotel to shelter from the storm.</p><p>\"I came to the hotel to shelter myself because it was windy and I thought it was dangerous,\" he told AFP.</p><p>\"I didn't feel safe at home.\"</p><p>By Monday morning, nearly 313,000 households in Kyushu and neighbouring Chugoku region were without power, utilities said. Hundreds of flights had been cancelled, NHK said, and many train services throughout the affected regions were also halted.</p><p>As of 11:00 am local time, the typhoon was spiralling north-northeast near Kitakyushu, Kyushu island's northernmost city, with maximum gusts of around 162 kilometres per hour, according to the JMA.</p><p>\"The thick cloud and eye area around the typhoon's centre have already disappeared and it is weakening rapidly,\" Ryuta Kurora, the head\u00a0of the JMA's forecast unit, told reporters.</p><p>\"The typhoon is still weakening, and from 9:00 am it has been downgraded from a category strong and large typhoon to a large typhoon,\" he said.</p><p>Japan is currently in typhoon season and faces around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods.</p><p>In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis smashed into Japan as it hosted the Rugby World Cup, claiming the lives of more than 100 people.\u00a0</p><p>A year earlier, Typhoon Jebi shut down Kansai Airport in Osaka, and left 14 people dead in its wake.</p><p>2018 was a particularly bad year, with floods and landslides killing more than 200 people in western Japan during the country's annual rainy season.</p><p>Scientists say climate change is increasing the severity of storms\u00a0and causing extreme weather such as heat waves, droughts and flash floods to become more frequent and intense.</p><p>By Atish PATEL</p><p>source: AFP</p><p>Copyright 2022 Alliance News Limited.

But it did announce more easing measures as it tries to offset economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and address corporate funding strains.<br/><br/>In addition, the central bank said it would now buy an unlimited amount of government bonds, scrapping an annual cap of USD745bn.

But it did announce more easing measures as it tries to offset economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and address corporate funding strains.<br/><br/>In addition, the central bank said it would now buy an unlimited amount of government bonds, scrapping an annual cap of USD745bn. According to CNN, this move was largely symbolic, since the central bank has in recent years been buying about a quarter of that amount annually, so it had a lot of room to increase its purchases even without removing the cap.<br/><br/>Japan's economy had been battling with recession even before the COVID-19 outbreak. The world's third-largest economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2019 as it absorbed a sales tax increase and had to deal with the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, a powerful storm that hit the country last autumn.        </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2CIU-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2CIU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YS7-9751-F0K1-N11M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">168957</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"285\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>COVID-19 Alerts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"52102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There is intrigue, however, as to whether new head coach Wayne Piuvac will see this match as an opportunity to blood some of his inexperienced younger guns, against what is seemingly the tournament's weakest opposition; he has not ruled out a debut for 18-year-old Gloucester wing Louis Rees-Zammit, for example. The Italians, spearheaded by the irrepressible Jake Polledri, will put up a fight, as always, but Wales', even without some of their bigger-name internationals, will have too much class.

For the year ended December\u00a031, 2019, Third Point Re reported net income available to common shareholders of\u00a0$200.6 million, or\u00a0$2.16\u00a0per diluted common share, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of\u00a0$317.7 million, or\u00a0$3.27\u00a0per diluted common share, for the year ended December\u00a031, 2018. \"We are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. Our return on equity was 2.1% in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to 16.7% and our diluted book value per share at the end of the year was\u00a0$15.04,\" commented\u00a0Dan Malloy, Chief Executive Officer.\u00a0\"Our combined ratio for the year was 103.2%, of which 4.1 percentage points, or\u00a0$29.0 million, was attributable to catastrophe events that occurred during the year.\u00a0Our combined ratio continues to improve as we execute on our shift in underwriting strategy. Our year to date investment return of 12.8% has contributed significantly to overall profits for the year. With underlying insurance and reinsurance market conditions both improving across many of the lines of business that we write, we believe we are well positioned to deliver increasingly attractive returns to shareholders and remain on track to achieve our goal of underwriting profitability in 2020.\" Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment Gross premiums written Gross premiums written increased by\u00a0$14.1 million, or 11.7%, to\u00a0$134.2 million\u00a0for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2019 from\u00a0$120.1 million\u00a0for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2018. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to\u00a0$85.6 million\u00a0of new premium written in the period, partially offset by the net impact of contract extensions, cancellations and contracts renewed with no comparable premium in the comparable period. </p><p>Gross premiums written increased by\u00a0$53.5 million, or 9.3%, to\u00a0$631.8 million\u00a0for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019 from\u00a0$578.3 million\u00a0for the year ended December\u00a031, 2018. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to\u00a0$93.0 million\u00a0related to two retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the period and\u00a0$68.3 million\u00a0of new property catastrophe business. This increase was partially offset by contracts that we did not renew in the current year as well as the net impact of contract extensions, cancellations and contracts renewed with no comparable premium in the comparable period. Net premiums earned The decrease in net premiums earned in the three months ended December\u00a031, 2019 compared to the three months ended December\u00a031, 2018 was primarily due to retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts that were written and fully earned in the prior year period of\u00a0$69.9 million\u00a0compared to\u00a0$34.3 million\u00a0in the current year period, partially offset by a higher in-force underwriting portfolio in the current year period. The increase in net premiums earned in the year ended December\u00a031, 2019 compared to the year ended December\u00a031, 2018 was primarily due to a higher in-force underwriting portfolio and retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts that were written and fully earned in the current year period of\u00a0$85.1 million\u00a0compared to\u00a0$74.2 million\u00a0for the year ended\u00a0December 31, 2018. Net underwriting results For the three months ended December\u00a031, 2019, we incurred net catastrophe losses of\u00a0$16.3 million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 8.2 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis, compared to\u00a0$18.5 million\u00a0in the three months ended December\u00a031, 2018, or 8.8 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to the\u00a0California\u00a0wildfires and other catastrophe events. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2019, we incurred net catastrophe losses of\u00a0$29.0 million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 4.1 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Dorian, Typhoon Faxai and Typhoon Hagibis, compared to\u00a0$18.5 million\u00a0in the year ended December\u00a031, 2018, or 3.0 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to the\u00a0California\u00a0wildfires and other 2018 catastrophe events. Although we did not specifically write property catastrophe contracts in 2018 or in prior years, we were exposed to\u00a0California\u00a0wildfire losses through liability reinsurance of the utilities in\u00a0California\u00a0during 2018 and incidental exposure that we had to catastrophic events on two\u00a0Florida\u00a0homeowners contracts, as a result of Hurricane Michael, and on two whole account reinsurance contracts. For the three and twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2019, we recorded a net\u00a0$1.1 million\u00a0and\u00a0$5.4 million\u00a0improvement in the net underwriting results, respectively, related to favorable development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs. The improvement in the net underwriting results for the three and twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2019 compared to prior year periods, after giving effect to catastrophe losses and reserve development, was primarily due to a shift in the mix of business, including earnings on new property catastrophe and specialty business. For the three and twelve months ended\u00a0December 31, 2018, we recorded a net\u00a0$0.3 million\u00a0and\u00a0$5.2 million\u00a0improvement in the net underwriting results, respectively, related to favorable development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-0F55565B0ED543A69C761C90752F857C</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBB-MMM1-DYG0-70GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"954\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 27, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It will leave interim Italy coach Franco Smith to find a new captain. Italy's two home games during this season's tournament are against Scotland on Feb 22 and England three weeks later.</p><p>\"I told Smith my desire to end my international career in Rome in front of my family, my friends and our fans,\" Parisse said. \"He agrees that I deserve another game, that I cannot end with that match cancelled by the typhoon. I will face Scotland, England or both, but I will certainly not play the entire Six Nations. The national team needs to develop other players with leadership skills. \"If I were permanently in a group, even more if I were a captain, I would occupy certain spaces. Instead, it is time for others to take my place.\"</p><p>The No8, who has won 142 caps, made his debut against the All Blacks in 2002. Only two players - New Zealand World Cup-winning captain Richie McCaw (148) and Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones (143) - have more international appearances.

Storms and other severe climatic phenomena present a threat to railway infrastructure, both old and new. Costly and time-consuming repairs\u00a0are inevitably needed, while the loss\u00a0of traffic can be hard to regain. In the case of lightly used rural routes the cost of repairs can be prohibitive, but some lines are surviving against the odds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Isumi Tetsudo partly reopens</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.railwaygazette.com/in-depth/passenger-rolling-stock-adapting-to-falling-numbers/57821.article\">On September\u00a08 2023 a typhoon with record rainfall hit central Honshu</url>, causing substantial damage to the 26\u22198\u00a0km Isume Tetsudo route which forms a rural link across the eastern part of the Boso peninsula in Chiba Prefecture, from Goi on the west coast to Ohara on the east.</p><p>The line suffered washouts that left the track suspended above collapsed embankments and culverts. The worst damage was over the 1\u22191\u00a0km between Otaki and Shiromigaoka and along the 11\u00a0km section from Otaki to Kazusa-Nakano, where there were six washouts.</p><p>Services over the Ohara - Otaki section were restored on September\u00a013, but no timescale has been announced for restoration of the 11\u00a0km western section to Kazusa-Nakano. There the line meets the Kominato Tetsudo, which was also damaged, meaning replacment buses are running between Kazusa-Nakano and Tsukisaki.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mine Line at risk</emphasis></p><p>On September\u00a019 JR West released details of the damage inflicted in Yamaguchi Prefecture on its 46\u00a0km Mine Line that links Nagatoshi with Asa on the Sanyo Shinkansen.</p><p>Torrential rainfall had caused substantial damage along the route, mainly where it follows the Asa River, crossing and recrossing it at different locations. This culminated on June\u00a030 when the river rose dramatically, sweeping away one of the Asa\u00a0bridges between Shirogahama and Minami-Omine.</p><p>JR West was forced to close the line, having discovered 18 embankment washouts, 43 landslides and nine bridges where the track had been deformed. Electrical equipment had also been damaged at numerous locations.</p><p>The damage brought back memories of similar events in July 2010 when the Asa River had also broken its banks. On that occasion\u00a0JR West had asked the government to develop a plan to mitigate the effects of flooding.</p><p>JR West has yet to reveal a timescale or cost for rebuilding the railway, but it is expected to run into billions of yen with repairs likely to take years, not months.</p><p>The route is losing traffic and money. Over the three years to fiscal year 2021 it incurred an average annual deficit of \u00a5460m, with average daily ridership falling to just 366.\u00a0 JR West has therefore asked local municipalities to consider how to support the line should it be restored.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yonesaka Line rebuild</emphasis></p><p>On September\u00a08 the first meeting of the Yonesaka Line Restoration Review Conference took place to consider options for the future of JR East's single-track Yonesaka Line. Badly damaged by floods at 112 locations in August 2022, the line runs east for 90\u22197\u00a0km from Yonezawa on the Ou Main Line and Yamagata Shinkansen through a mountainous area to Sakamachi on the Uetsu Main Line, close to the Sea of Japan coast. The damage had forced suspension of services over the 67\u22197\u00a0km between Imasizumi and Sakamachi.</p><p>JR East estimated that repairs would cost around \u00a58\u22196bn and take five years to complete. About \u00a55\u22195bn would be needed for work within Yamagata Prefecture, with no less than \u00a51\u22196bn of this required to rebuild a bridge over the Koshira River. A further \u00a53\u22191bn would need to be spent in Niigata Prefecture.</p><p>JR East was concerned about the high cost and had been contemplating bus replacement. Local authorities, however, were keen to see the railway revived, prompting JR East to set up the Restoration Review Conference.</p><p>The event was attended by representatives from Yamagata and Niigata Prefectures, and seven local authorities served by the railway, together with a representative from\u00a0the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport &amp; Tourism and JR East officials.</p><p>Agreement was reached to try and rebuild the line by taking advantage of the Disaster Restoration Subsidy scheme, with costs shared by the parties involved. Under this proposal local and prefectural authorities would split the cost with JR.</p><p>The scheme requires a business plan to be drawn up for at least the next 10 years, so guaranteeing the railway's survival over this period. A template existed in the recent restoration of the Tadami Line, where JR East rebuilt both infrastructure and stations and then handed them to Fukushima Prefecture without charge. The prefecture then outsourced maintenance to JR East at an annual cost of \u00a5200m, of which the prefecture pays 70% and local authorities the rest.</p><p>As with other rural routes in Japan, the Yonesaka Line is a victim of depopulation, new road construction and rising car ownership. Whereas in 1987 the section between Imaizumi and Oguni was used by 833 passengers a day, by 2018 the figure had fallen to just 274. Similarly, daily traffic between Oguni and Sakamachi over the same period tumbled from 846 to 180 passengers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uncertain future</emphasis></p><p>Back in August 2022 JR East's Tsugaru Line from Aomori to Minmaya at the northern tip of Honshu was severely damaged by floods in the remote forested area north of Kanita, forcing suspension of train services between there and Minmaya. Low ridership on this stretch prompted JR East to decide not to repair it until local authority views about its survival had been assessed.</p><p>This section of the line runs through an area that includes the municipalities of Sotogahama and Imabetsu. Most of the district is sparsely populated, except along the coast, the interior consisting of densely forested uplands.</p><p>Imabetsu municipality originally wanted to reopen the entire line, but during summer 2023 it suggested that repairs might be undertaken only along the remote stretch between Kanita, the freight-only junction with the Hokkaido Shinkansen at Odai, and Okutsugaru-Imabetsu, a halt adjacent to the Shinkansen station. Note that the Shinkansen here is dual-gauge to allow JR freight and local passenger trains to pass through the Seikan tunnel. From Okutsugaru-Imabetsu to Minmaya, the railway follows a road along the coast, meaning that bus services could be provided as an alternative.</p><p>The municipality's main argument is that the road between Kanita and Imabetsu crosses the Imabetsu pass, while the railway runs in tunnel below. Snowfall is particularly heavy here, and the road is often blocked in winter.</p><p>'Devastation was\u00a0reported at 317 locations\u00a0on the Sanriku Tetsudo\u00a0(Santetsu) following the\u00a0Great East Japan Earthquake\u00a0and tsunami in March 2011'</p><p>Although the proposal is logical, it seems unlikely to succeed. Sotogahama municipality has offered no support for reopening, and 12 of the 13 damaged locations lie in the 22\u00a0km section between Odai and Okutsugaru-Imabetsu, partly within Imabetsu municipality.</p><p>&lt;!-- An error occurred in parsing html (ParseInlineImages) --&gt;</p><p/><p>Photo: Alexander Tidd / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Shimanokoshi station was located on a low viaduct; it was swept away by the waves.</p><p>JR East estimated the cost of repairing the whole line at \u00a5600m, so reopening only to Okutsugaru-Imabetsu would\u00a0not save a great deal. Not only that, but potential traffic from the four stations over the 9\u22194\u00a0km between there and Minmaya would be lost to bus operators.</p><p>Alternatives to complete closure are being explored, but the low population means that it would be hard to fund any work from local taxes. One option would be to establish a freight-only connection with the Hokkaido Shinkansen at Okutsugaru-Imabetsu, instead of at Odai. Locating the connection here would mean electrifying this steeply graded stretch, which includes several tunnels where expensive clearance enhancement may be needed.</p><p>Another suggestion is to extend Tsugaru Line passenger services over the existing dual-gauge track from\u00a0Odai to the Shinkansen station at Okutsugaru-Imabetsu. This would involve constructing a new track and platform at Okutsugaru-Imabetsu but would cost less than electrifying the local line. It would also require 1\u00a0067\u00a0mm gauge stock able to accept the Shinkansen's 25\u00a0kV 50\u00a0Hz power supply as well as an arrangement under which JR\u00a0East's costs for running the local trains would not be borne by JR Hokkaido, owner of the Hokkaido Shinkansen.</p><p>&lt;!-- An error occurred in parsing html (ParseInlineImages) --&gt;</p><p/><p>Photo: ChiefHira / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>The region served by the Sanriku Tetsudo was severely damaged by the 2011 tsunami and earthquake.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Support in Kanazawa</emphasis></p><p>Local mayors in the municipalities served by the Ishikawa Line of the privately run Ishikawa Hokuriku Railway in Kanazawa Prefecture met on August\u00a030 to debate the railway's future after a long period of declining traffic. Along with Prefectural Governor Hiroshi Hase, who was attending as an observer, the mayors represented Kanazawa, Nonoichi, Hakusan and Uchinada.</p><p>Daily traffic had declined from a peak of 2\u00a0569 passengers in 1991 to 1\u00a0877 in 2019 with a further drop to 1\u00a0314 in 2020 because of the Covid\u00a019 pandemic.</p><p>Options for the route, which is electrified at 600\u00a0V DC, had been put forward in March 2023 in a regional public transport plan drawn up by the Ishikawa Central Metropolitan Area Regional Public Transport Council, formed of local municipalities.</p><p>After rejecting a proposal to convert the line into a busway as there were too few bus drivers, the mayors confirmed their support for the railway and suggested ideas for its development. One proposal, which would require dual-voltage trains, was construction of a chord to provide a connection to the Hokuriku Main Line, enabling operation of through services to Kanazawa. Construction of a 1\u22195\u00a0km extension northwards from Nomachi to Korinbo was also considered as a long-term objective.</p><p>The Ishikawa Line runs for 13\u22198\u00a0km from Nomachi to Shin-Nishi-Kanazawa and Tsurugi, serving the southern suburbs of Kanazawa and traversing semi-rural or low-density residential areas. There is interchange at Shin-Nishi-Kanazawa with the Hokuriku Main Line.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Santetsu survives</emphasis></p><p>The Sanriku Tetsudo (Santetsu) represents a remarkable survival story. Located in Iwate Prefecture, the route, which was only completed in 1984, runs along the coast from Sendai to Hachinohe in northern Honshu, serving the towns of Kesennuma, Sakari, Kamaishi, Miyako and Kuji. Santetsu was founded as a third sector company in 1981 with Iwate Prefecture as its majority shareholder to operate the Sakari to Kamaishi and Miyako to Kuji sections of the route.</p><p>On March\u00a011 2011 coastal settlements in northern Miyagi and Iwate Prefectures were devastated by the Great Tohoku Earthquake and tsunami. With a moment magnitude of 9\u22191\u00a0Mw, it was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, causing 19\u00a0759 deaths and 6\u00a0242 injuries, with 2\u00a0553 people declared missing.</p><p>On the two sections of the Santetsu, devastation was reported at 317 locations. On the JR\u00a0East section between Kamaishi and Miyako there was also severe damage - seven of\u00a0the 13 stations, six bridges and 10 embankments were destroyed and about 8\u22195\u00a0km of route had been obliterated.</p><p>&lt;!-- An error occurred in parsing html (ParseInlineImages) --&gt;</p><p/><p>Photo: Kenkenken667 / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>A Sanriku Tetsudo Series 36-700 DMU at Sakari in July 2014. Sakari station isserved by JR East's BRT service to and from Kesennuma, which uses part of the trackbed of the Ofunato Line, which was heavily damaged by the tsunami in March 2011.</p><p>Santetsu set about repairing the damage, reopening the line in stages. Infrastructure repairs were completed in 2014, and three new diesel railcars were acquired in January that year using finance from Kuwait.</p><p>In 2012 only 400\u00a0000 passengers travelled on the usable sections of line, but in the financial year to March\u00a031 2015 there was a 38% increase over the previous year with 690\u00a0000 passengers carried. Fare receipts were higher than in the financial year ending March\u00a031 2011.</p><p>Perhaps the increase was partly explained by publicity that accrued from a soap opera aired by Japan Broadcasting Corp every morning between April and September 2013. The story covered the period from 2008 to 2012, which included the earthquake, which the producers duly incorporated into the storyline. Much of the filming was carried out in the scenic area served by the railway, which featured prominently throughout. The broadcast gave impetus to local residents to encourage tourism - and use of their railway.</p><p>On the 55\u00a0km central section of the route, which forms part of JR East's Yamada Line from Morioka to Kamaishi, four of the 13 stations had been destroyed, together with 5\u22195\u00a0km of the track, six bridges and 10 embankments. On June\u00a025 2012 JR East arranged a meeting with local authorities to discuss the line's future.</p><p>On January\u00a031 2014 JR\u00a0East decided to spend \u00a514bn on rebuilding the closed stretch of coastal line, with the municipalities covering the remaining \u00a57bn. Operations would then be transferred, free of charge, to Santetsu, which would be able to run through services between Sakari and Kuji.</p><p>Work started on March\u00a07 2015 and was completed on July\u00a018 2018. The\u00a0first test run was made on August\u00a021 between Kamaishi and Otsuchi using\u00a0a 65\u00a0tonne diesel shunter, and test running over the whole line began in the early autumn ahead of a festive reopening on March 19-23 2019. On August 26 2019 Santetsu carried its 50millionth passenger since April 1984.</p><p>Then disaster struck again. In mid-October 2019 Typhoon Hagibis brought torrential rain to the Sanriku coast and mountains. Rivers flooded and embankments were swept away. Over the 163\u00a0km of the Santetsu line, nearly 114\u00a0km were again out of use. Between Sakari, Kamaishi, Miyako and Kuji the railway was reported to be damaged in up to 90 locations.</p><p>Water had ruined 15 signalling equipment cabinets and destroyed wiring and cabling. All services were suspended on October 12-14, while some of the least damaged stretches were quickly repaired.</p><p>&lt;!-- An error occurred in parsing html (ParseInlineImages) --&gt;</p><p/><p>Photo: KiTaHiMu / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>A newly introduced Series MT4000 diesel railcar calls at Takamori station on the Minami Aso Line in December 2022.</p><p>The typhoon also forced JR\u00a0East to close its Hachinohe Line, which runs from Kuji to Hachinohe, over the 37\u22194\u00a0km between Hashikami and Kuji because embankments had been washed away; landslides had occurred in 23 locations.</p><p>Santetsu launched a fundraising appeal that attracted more than 100 donations in a few days, with support offered from all over the country. An emergency timetable was introduced on usable stretches of line.</p><p>Between Sakari and Kamaishi the railway ran as normal, but between Kamaishi and Miyako it was closed completely. Between Miyako and Kuji services were quickly restored as far north as Taro, with buses thence to\u00a0and from Kuji. The timetable was restructured to meet the needs of schoolchildren, although the four return bus services took longer than the trains and suffered from overcrowding and traffic congestion.</p><p>Between November 2019 and 20\u00a0March 2020 both Santetsu and JR\u00a0East restored and reopened all the damaged stretches of line, a remarkable achievement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bleak outlook in Kyushu</emphasis></p><p>In July 2020 record-breaking torrential rain caused flooding, landslides, and widespread damage on the island of Kyushu. Around 4\u00a0700 buildings were destroyed and at least 66 people died. Storms struck again in late June and early July 2023, though with fewer fatalities.</p><p>Kyushu has many loss-making\u00a0rural lines, some of which have been damaged by extreme weather. In some cases traffic has been suspended indefinitely while the operators seek means of financing repairs or other options.</p><p>In the Kuma valley, JR Kyushu's Hisatsu Line, between Yatsushiro and Hitoyoshi, remains closed following the 2020 floods, which swept away two river bridges. Discussions with local authorities continue over rebuilding, with substitute bus and taxi services provided on parallel roads up the valley. A similar situation prevails on the 24\u22198km third sector Kumagawa Tetsudo, from Hitoyoshi-Onsen to Yunomae, where a river bridge was destroyed.</p><p>Although the situation in Kyushu is bleak, there is one example in the west of the island where a badly damaged line has reopened. The Minami Aso Takamori Line (Mantetsu) was built to connect Tateno on the Hohi Main Line with Takamori, a distance of 17\u22197\u00a0km. On April 1 1986 JNR transferred its operation to the third sector Minami Aso Tetsudo.</p><p>During the April 2016 Kumamoto earthquake the line was severely damaged, particularly on the\u00a010\u22196\u00a0km section between Tateno and Nakamatsu where two bridges and\u00a0two tunnels were affected. While services over the remainder of the line were restored in late July 2016, repairs here only began in 2022. They were completed in time for full reopening on July\u00a015 2023.</p><p>Repair and upgrading work cost around \u00a56\u22197bn, with 97\u22195% of the cost met by the central government under a programme for railway restoration following natural disasters. The remainder came from Kumamoto prefectural government and Minami-Aso municipal council.</p><p>In November 2022 two new Series MT4000 diesel railcars were acquired from Niigata Transys. They are equipped with ATS-DK automatic ATP, enabling services to be extended from Tateno to Higo-Otsu on the Hohi Main Line. This is expected to drive up traffic, in particular leisure travel.</p><p>The railcars have step-free access and are fitted with multiple language passenger information systems with a view to encouraging foreign visitors to travel over the railway, which passes through spectacular scenery.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.railwaygazette.com/digital-magazines/railway-gazette-international-2023-digital-archive/63453.article\"/> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RAILGA-65498</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RAILGA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69Y5-P3H1-DXPW-60GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2927\"/><timeReceived>3:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 DVV Media International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Railway Gazette International</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7554\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 18, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002KSU</classCode><className>WEST JAPAN RAILWAY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002DKE</classCode><className>EAST JAPAN RAILWAY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS485112 COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS482112 SHORT LINE RAILROADS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS482111 LINE-HAUL RAILROADS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC4111 LOCAL &amp;

Strengths: Head coach Allister Coetzee was on the South Africa coaching team in their World Cup success of 2007 and was head coach from 2016 to 2018.</p><p>Forwards C T van Jaarsveld Unattached 19 10 L vd Westhuizen Cheetahs 27 9 J Benade Univ Namibia 11 0 A Coetzee Cheetahs 28 1 D Sethie Univ Namibia 15 1 C Viviers Saint Nazaire 39 1 T de Klerk Mogliano 1 0 A Ludick Limoges 7 2 M Tjeriko Univ Namibia 11 1 T Uanivi Montauban 33 3 PJ van Lill Unattached 59 9 A Booysen Dallas Jackals 24 4 W Conradie New England 26 15 P Gaoseb Tel Aviv Heat 10 0 R Hardwick Unattached 1 0 M Katjijeko Tel Aviv Heat 20 2 J Retief Griquas 19 1 Backs O Blaauw Univ Jo'burg 0 0 D Stevens New Orleans 34 5 J Theron Wanderers 1 0 C Loubser Utah Warriors 15 5 T Swanepoel Lions 2 0 A van den Berg Wanderers 2 1 D Burger Wanderers 3 2 J Deysel Colomiers 33 12 L Malan New England 2 0 JC Greyling Wanderers 40 30 A Izaacs Univ Namibia 0 0 G Mouton Wits University 2 1 C Plato Kudus 4 1 D Rossouw Krasny Yar 4 3</p><p>Weaknesses: The squad lacks experience in top-level leagues and a lack of exposure to top-tier nations.

Strengths: A powerful pack, organised defence and sharp attacking backline give them a perfect winning profile. Weaknesses: Losing Ntamack is a huge blow especially given his partnership with Toulouse teammate Antoine Dupont. Prospects New Zealand first up, probably South Africa or Ireland in the quarters, Les Bleus face a tough trip to the semis.</p><p>Uruguay</p><p>THIS is Uruguay's third successive World Cup appearance and fifth in all.</p><p>Coach Esteban Meneses RWC pool-stage record P 15 W 3 L 12 D 0 RWC knockout record P0</p><p>After losing all of their pool matches at the 2015 tournament, Los Teros opened with a shock victory over Fiji in 2019.</p><p>SQUAD</p><p>That result has to be put in perspective as the Fijians were playing just four days after a hard-fought defeat to Australia, and Uruguay then lost their next three.</p><p>But they covered big handicaps against Wales and Australia in that tournament and in all four of their pool matches in 2015.</p><p>Forwards C T F Gattas Old Glory DC 39 5 G Kessler Unattached 61 26 G Pujadas Penarol 27 10 D Arbelo Penarol 18 0 M Ben\u00edtez Penarol 44 1 I P\u00e9culo Penarol 12 0 R Piussi Penarol 3 0 M Sanguinetti Penarol 79 5 F Aliaga Penarol 5 2 I Dotti Penarol 59 5 M Leindekar Bayonne 27 1 M Ardao Miami Sharks 22 1 L Bianchi Penarol 9 3 S Civetta Penarol 25 4 C Deus Penarol 3 1 M Diana Penarol 37 11 E Dosantos Penarol 15 1 J M Rodr\u00edguez Penarol 3 1 Backs S Alvarez Penarol 6 0 S Arata Castres 45 18 A Ormaechea Nice 55 9 F Berchesi Unattached 44 3 F Etcheverry Miami Sharks 19 3 F Arcos P\u00e9rez Old Boys 9 1 N Freitas Unattached 49 18 T Inciarte Miami Sharks 31 7 A Vilaseca Vannes 75 19 J M Alonso Penarol 8 0 B Amaya Old Boys 7 5 B Basso Old Boys 4 1 I Facciolo CTM Rugby 1 0 G Mieres Penarol 81 18 R Silva Penarol 77 22</p><p>The majority of the squad are drawn from Montevideo club side Penarol and scrum-half Santiago Arata of Castres is the only player from a top-flight league. Strengths: Their most winnable match is against Namibia and the schedule favours them over the African side.</p><p>Weaknesses: There's very little big-league experience in the squad compared to previous tournaments.

England used the opportunity to hold a training camp in Miyazaki, out of the Typhoon's path, and followed it with sensational performances against Australia and New Zealand to reach the tournament's final.</p><p>\"We're aware of it, no one really has any idea what might happen,\" George told the BBC. \"It's a difficult one for us at the minute. The most important thing is that we have a game at home against Wales to prepare for.</p><p>\"We have had to deal with before, obviously in a different way, with the typhoon in Japan. These things happen, it's pretty out of our control. There's not a lot we can do about it.</p><p>\"Eddie [Jones, the head coach] speaks about it a lot, it's a cliche answer, but focusing on what we can control. The main focus for us is making sure we get better and put ourselves in the best position to beat Wales.\"</p><p>                     George said players will take the RFU lead and is confident the right decision will be made about matches. He praised England's staff for their handling of the situation in Japan.</p><p>\"Most of the credit has to go to the staff, really,\" he said. \"We are very lucky in camp to have some of the best backroom staff around. Within an hour or two we were on a plane down to Miyazaki and had a brilliant training camp down there that set us up nicely for a quarter-final and semi-final. Of course we would have preferred to play the game, we love playing against France.</p><p>\"But we are very blessed to have an amazing staff in general and the playing group responds very well to situations like that. We are confident that we will be as well prepared as we can be if anything does happen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-60607158</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y98-2XG1-F021-611N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"362\"/><timeReceived>2:33 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D9GY</classCode><className>SPORTS INSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GR156</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This evaluates the impact of global natural disaster events to identify trends, manage volatility and enhance resilience.</p><p><br/><br/>The report reveals that the 409 natural catastrophe events of 2019 resulted in economic losses of USD232 billion - 3 percent below average annual losses for this century, but 20 percent lower than the previous decade. Of that total, private sector and government-sponsored insurance programs covered USD71 billion of the total - six percent above the century average but significantly lower than the record USD157 billion in 2017 and USD100 billion in 2018. This means the protection gap, which is the portion of economic losses not covered by insurance, was 69 percent in 2019 - the fifth-lowest since 2000.<br/><br/>The 12-months under review witnessed 41 billion-dollar economic loss events, and 12 billion-dollar insured loss events, with the two costliest insurance events, Typhoon Hagibis and Typhoon Faxai, occurring in Japan and causing USD9bn and USD6bn in insured losses respectively, due to each storm tracking through a highly urbanized area. The costliest individual peril was inland flooding, which caused economic losses globally of USD82 billion; preceded by tropical cyclone, at USD68 billion.<br/><br/>From a climate perspective, 2019 was the second warmest year on record for land and ocean temperatures since 1851. Notably, record temperatures of 46.0-degreeC were seen in France and 42.6-degreeC in Germany, while the January to May period was the wettest on record in the United States, with 15.71 inches (399 millimeters) of rainfall.<br/><br/>Andy Marcell, CEO of Aon's Reinsurance Solutions business, commented: 'Following two costly back-to-back years for natural disasters in 2017 and 2018, there were several moderately large catastrophes but strong capitalization has allowed the re/insurance industry to comfortably manage recent losses. However, as socioeconomic patterns further combine with scientific factors such as climate change or extreme weather variability, the potential financial costs at play are only going to increase so building resilience is key.'<br/><br/>2010-2019 marked the costliest decade on record with economic damage reaching USD2.98 trillion - some USD1.19 trillion higher than 2000-2009 and with Asia-Pacific accounting for 44 percent. Private and public insurance entities paid out USD845 billion during the decade with the U.S. accounting for 55 percent alone.<br/><br/>Steve Bowen, Director and Meteorologist at Aon's Impact Forecasting team, commented: 'Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the last decade of natural disasters was the emergence of previously considered 'secondary' perils - such as wildfire, flood, and drought - becoming much more costly and impactful. Scientific research indicates that climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanized areas. As the public and private sectors balance an understanding of the science with smart business solutions, this will lead to new advances that lower the physical risk and improve overall awareness.'<br/><br/>Other significant regional events during the year included:<br/><br/>Wettest 12-month stretch in the contiguous U.S. on record dating to 1895 with river flooding across the Mississippi River watershed causing more than USD20 billion in economic losses<br/><br/>Category 5 Hurricane Dorian made multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a 185 mph (295 kph) storm; tying with the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane as the strongest landfalling storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean<br/><br/>Cyclone Idai in Mozambique caused the most substantial humanitarian crisis killing 1,303 people and destroying more than 300,000 homes with USD2 billion economic losses.<br/><br/>Windstorm Eberhard was the lone event in Europe to surpass USD1 billion in insured losses after tracking across Western and Central Europe in March.<br/><br/>Globe's deadliest earthquake occurred in Albania on November 26, killing 52 people<br/><br/>Monsoon rains led to a combined USD25 billion in flood-related damage in China (USD15 billion) and India (USD10 billion) alone<br/><br/>Intense multi-year drought and record-setting spring and summer heat led to conditions able to ignite destructive bushfires in Australia. Some 18.2 million hectares (46 million acres) burned and more than 2,500 homes were destroyed, likely to result in insured losses topping USD1 billion.<br/><br/>Top 10 Global Economic Loss Events<br/><br/>View News Release Full Screen<br/><br/>Date(s)<br/><br/>Event<br/><br/>Location<br/><br/>Deaths<br/><br/>Economic Loss<br/><br/>(USD billions)<br/><br/>Insured Loss<br/><br/>(USD billions)<br/><br/>October 6-12<br/><br/>Typhoon Hagibis<br/><br/>Japan<br/><br/>99<br/><br/>15.0<br/><br/>9.0<br/><br/>June - August<br/><br/>Monsoon Floods<br/><br/>China<br/><br/>300<br/><br/>15.0<br/><br/>0.7<br/><br/>September 7-9<br/><br/>Typhoon Faxai<br/><br/>Japan<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>6.0<br/><br/>May - July<br/><br/>Mississippi River Basin Floods<br/><br/>United States<br/><br/>0<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>4.0<br/><br/>Aug 25 - Sep 7<br/><br/>Hurricane Dorian<br/><br/>Bahamas, Caribbean, US, Canada<br/><br/>83<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>3.5<br/><br/>March 12-31<br/><br/>Missouri River Basin Floods<br/><br/>United States<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>2.5<br/><br/>June - October<br/><br/>Monsoon Floods<br/><br/>India<br/><br/>1,750<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>0.2<br/><br/>August 6-13<br/><br/>Typhoon Lekima<br/><br/>China, Philippines, Japan<br/><br/>101<br/><br/>9.5<br/><br/>0.8<br/><br/>March - April<br/><br/>Flooding<br/><br/>Iran<br/><br/>77<br/><br/>8.3<br/><br/>0.2<br/><br/>May 2-5<br/><br/>Cyclone Fani<br/><br/>India, Bangladesh<br/><br/>81<br/><br/>8.1<br/><br/>0.5<br/><br/>ALL OTHER EVENTS<br/><br/>126 billion<br/><br/>44 billion<br/><br/>TOTALS<br/><br/>232 billion1<br/><br/>71 billion1,2<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Subject to change as loss estimates are further developed<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Includes losses sustained by private insurers and government-sponsored programs<br/><br/>Access the full report plus watch meteorologist and report author Steve Bowen's short film about the key findings on the interactive microsite: <url normalizedValue=\"https://aon.io/2FOWzrp\">https://aon.io/2FOWzrp</url><br/><br/>Access current and historical natural catastrophe data, plus event analysis, on Impact Forecasting's Catastrophe Insight website<br/><br/>About Aon<br/><br/>Aon plc (NYSE:AON) is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, retirement and health solutions.

The combined ratio (discounted and undiscounted) is the ratio, in per cent, of the sum of net insurance expense plus all other operating expenses to net insurance revenue.Alex Maloney, Group Chief Executive Officer, commented:\u201cLancashire delivered an outstanding performance in 2023. We continued to focus on writing profitable business in the best market conditions we have seen for a decade.Aligned to our belief in managing the market cycle, we have built a better balanced and more diverse underwriting portfolio over the past five years, which is generating more profit against our capital base. This has been one of our core strategic goals and will continue to be a focus going forwards.Gross premiums written increased by 16.9%, and insurance revenue increased by 23.9%, during the year, due to a combination of new business and rate rises across our portfolio.This focus on profitable growth has resulted in an excellent underwriting performance with a combined ratio (undiscounted) of 82.6%, or 74.9% on a discounted basis, with a net insurance services result of $382.1 million. Our overall profit after tax for the year was $321.5 million resulting in a change in diluted book value per share of 24.7%.Our investment portfolio also had a strong year and benefited from higher interest rates. </p><p>The portfolio returned 5.7%, resulting in a net investment return of $160.5 million.Lancashire is always led by the underwriting opportunity. We believe there are significant opportunities going into 2024 and we are well capitalised to be able to fund these through existing resources and internal earnings growth.In light of the excellent financial performance in 2023, we are returning the majority of our earnings to shareholders.While we did not complete the share buyback of up to $50 million announced in the third quarter of 2023, we are today announcing a special dividend of $0.50 per common share in part to reflect this as well as the strong operating performance and supportive outlook. This dividend follows the special dividend of $0.50 per common share paid in December 2023.Additionally, given the increased resilience of our business model, we are announcing a change to our regular final and interim dividend policy. Our Board has declared a final dividend of $0.15 per common share, an increase of 50% from last year (and which is subject to shareholder approval at our AGM in May). It is also our current intention to increase the Group\u2019s ordinary interim dividend to $0.075 per common share. Our interim dividends are usually paid after the announcement of our results for the first six months of the year.Lancashire remains focused on delivering its strategic objectives and continuing the growth and momentum we have built during 2023. Our franchise remains strong and we have fantastic teams across the Group who are dedicated to achieving our goals.I would like to thank everyone at Lancashire for their hard work and commitment during 2023, and our shareholders, brokers, clients and other stakeholders for their continued support for our business.\u201dBusiness update<br/>\u00a0Momentum continues for 2024The market showed continued discipline at the 1 January renewals and we are happy with the outcome. From the supply side, we have seen no significant new entrants coming into the market and existing participants have shown willingness to support good quality business at the right level after a strong year in 2023. We are continuing to see growth in demand from clients due to inflationary pressures, helping mitigate some of the increased supply. Importantly, for catastrophe exposed reinsurance, attachment levels have remained a focus for the market, with sustained reluctance for low attaching layers. Within our non-catastrophe exposed products, almost all product lines remain in a very strong position from a rating adequacy perspective. Overall, for 2024 the market appears to be more stable, at healthier levels of profitability. We continue to remain disciplined in our underwriting, while taking advantage of the stronger market conditions.<br/>Lancashire U.S.During 2023, we announced the launch of Lancashire InsuranceU.S., which will operate under a delegated underwriting arrangement with Lancashire\u2019s UK company platform. This development has been driven by the compelling underwriting opportunity that we see in the U.S. Excess and Surplus market. Lancashire InsuranceU.S. will allow us to write business that we could not access before through new distribution channels and with new clients.Delivering for our peopleWe are fundamentally a people business, and we believe that focusing on our people as part of our strategy is crucial to our ongoing success. We instil high expectations in our people and aim to offer a culture that is diverse, unique and special. The growth we have seen over the past few years has increased the scope of the opportunities available. We also want to reward people for their hard work and during 2023 we made 46 internal promotions across the Group.Our 2023 employee survey showed strong support for our culture and the experience we offer our people. Our highest scores were for being proud to work at Lancashire at 94%, while 92% of people said they are motivated to do their best work and would recommend Lancashire as a great place to work.<br/>Delivering for our communitiesSince it was founded in 2007, the Lancashire Foundation has donated over $23 million to charities and in 2023 it distributed $700,000 across a range of causes. This included smaller donations totalling $56,000 to charitable organisations personally nominated by our employees. In November 2023, 12 employees also volunteered their time for Project Transform, travelling to Tanzania to assist with a construction project. We look forward to continuing these activities in 2024 and beyond.Bermuda corporate income taxDuring 2024, the Group will continue to assess the potential impact of the Economic Transition Adjustment introduced by the recent Bermuda Corporate Income Tax legislation. Based on its current plans, the Group does not anticipate that it will become subject to Bermuda corporate income tax until 1 January 2030, as it expects to fall within the exclusion within the Bermuda corporate income tax rules that means groups with a limited international presence are excluded from scope for a period of up to five years.Underwriting resultsGross premiums written<br/>Gross premiums written increased by $279.4 million or 16.9% during 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums and multi-year contracts, underlying growth in gross premiums written was 17.8%. The Group\u2019s two principal segments, and the key market factors impacting them, are discussed below.Reinsurance segment<br/>The increase in the reinsurance segment was primarily driven by new business in the casualty reinsurance classes as well as the continued successful build out of our specialty reinsurance classes in a strong rating environment. The property reinsurance classes also benefited from strong RPIs and new business, albeit these were somewhat offset by a lower level of reinstatement premiums than in 2022 due to higher catastrophe losses in that year. Overall, the RPI was 122% for the reinsurance segment up from 108% in the prior year.Insurance segment<br/>The increase in the insurance segment was primarily due to strong growth in our property insurance lines of business, which include property direct and facultative and also property construction. In these classes we are seeing the benefit of a strong rating environment and also a more mature book of business following the decision to add new teams in recent years. Gross premiums written in the energy and marine lines also increased meaningfully with new business across all lines of business and rate and exposure increases in power and energy liabilities classes. To a lesser extent, new business contributed to growth across all of our casualty insurance lines of business. Rate and exposure increases were the driver of growth in aviation insurance. Overall, the RPI was 110% for the insurance segment.\u00a0\u00a0Insurance revenueInsurance revenue comprises gross premiums earned less inwards reinstatement premium, and is net of commission costs. Insurance revenue increased by $293.4 million or 23.9% in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The market factors driving the increase in casualty reinsurance, property insurance and energy &amp; marine insurance gross premiums written also drove the increase in insurance revenue recognised in the period.Allocation of reinsurance premiums<br/>Allocation of reinsurance premiums comprises ceded earned premium less outward reinstatement premiums, and is net of outward commission costs. Allocation of reinsurance premiums increased $53.0 million or 14.3% in 2023 compared to the prior year. This increase was largely the result of the rate increases experienced upon renewal of the Group's outwards reinsurance programme, additional cover purchased for some of the newer lines of business and a higher level of quota share reinsurance spend driven by the growth in insurance revenue. Overall, the allocation of reinsurance premiums as a percentage of insurance revenue was 27.9% down from 30.3% in the prior year.Net claimsDuring 2023, the Group experienced net losses (undiscounted, including reinstatement premiums) from catastrophe, weather and large loss events totalling $106.1 million. None of these events were individually material for the Group.In comparison, during 2022, the Group experienced net losses (undiscounted, including reinstatement premiums) from catastrophe, weather and large loss events of $329.4 million. Within this, catastrophe and weather-related losses for the year ended 31 December 2022, were $232.4 million. This included $181.0 million from hurricane Ian. Large losses for the year amounted to $97.0 million.Prior year development comprises the undiscounted movement in loss reserves, expense provisions and reinstatement premiums. Favourable development was $78.8 million in 2023 compared to favourable development of $134.3 million in 2022. In 2023, there were reductions in reserves for some of the 2022 natural catastrophe events. The 2022 year included reserve reductions from natural catastrophe loss events in the 2019 and 2018 accident years as well as relatively large beneficial claims settlements on risk losses in the 2017 accident year.\u00a0Netdiscounting benefit<br/>The table below shows the total net impact of discounting under IFRS 17, by financial statement line item.In 2023 discount rates across all our major currencies were at a relatively high level throughout the year with a small decrease in the fourth quarter. This drove the high initial discount impact and relatively low change in assumption impact.In comparison, 2022 began in a relatively low discount rate environment, which then experienced significant increases across all currencies throughout the year. This increase in rates resulted in a favourable $39.4 million impact from the change in discount rate assumptions. This was only partly offset by $26.0 million unwind of the initial discount previously recognised in relation to prior accident years that had been set in a lower rate environment.Investments<br/>\u00a0<br/>Net investment income, excluding realised and unrealised gains and losses, was $108.5 million in 2023, an increase of 94.8% compared to 2022. Total investment return, including net investment income, net realised gains and losses and net change in unrealised gains and losses, was $160.5 million in 2023 compared to a loss of $76.7 million in 2022.In a year of continued volatility, the investment portfolio generated an investment return of 5.7%. The returns were driven primarily from investment income given the higher yields during the year. While the Federal Reserve raised rates by 1.0% this year, the higher yields and tighter spreads mitigated any losses on the portfolio. In addition, the risk assets, notably the bank loans, hedge funds and private credit, all contributed positively to the overall investment return.\u00a0In 2022, the investment portfolio generated a negative return of 3.5%. The returns were driven primarily from interest rate increases and the widening of credit spreads, resulting in losses in all asset classes, most of which were unrealised.The managed portfolio was invested as follows:Key investment portfolio statistics for our fixed maturity securities and managed cash and cash equivalents were:Other operating expenses<br/>\u00a0A significant driver of the increase in operating expenses is the increase in variable costs related to remuneration of $31.9 million given the strong financial performance of the Group. Fixed expenses have increased by 24.4% or $29.0 million largely due to the Group\u2019s growth and subsequent impact on headcount. IT and consulting expenses also increased during the year as we focused on upgrading our systems and data capabilities.\u00a0For the year ended 31 December 2023, $82.2 million of operating expenses were considered directly attributable to the fulfillment of (re)insurance contracts issued, and have therefore been re-allocated to insurance service expenses and form part of the insurance service result. This compares to $70.4 million in 2022.Capital<br/>As at 31 December 2023, total capital available to Lancashire was approximately $2.0 billion, comprising shareholders\u2019 equity of $1.5 billion and $0.5 billion of long-term debt. Tangible capital was approximately $1.8 billion. Leverage was 22.8% on total capital and 25.2% on tangible capital. Total capital and total tangible capital as at 31 December 2022 were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion respectively.Share repurchasesDuring the period commencing 22 November 2023 and ending on 29 February 2024, the Company had authorised a share repurchase programme of its common shares of US$0.50 each up to a maximum consideration of $50.0 million. No shares were repurchased under the programme.No other share repurchase programmes were conducted during the year ended 31 December 2023.Dividends<br/>The Lancashire Board declared the following dividends during 2023:<emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">A final dividend relating to 2022 of $0.10 per common share;</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">An interim dividend of $0.05 per common share; and</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">A special dividend of $0.50 per common share.</emphasis>Lancashire\u2019s Board of Directors has declared a special dividend of $0.50 per common share (approximately \u00a30.39 per common share at the current exchange rate), which will result in an aggregate payment of approximately $119.0 million.

Management believes that the APMs included in the Financial Statements are important for understanding the Group\u2019s overall results of operations and may be helpful to investors and other interested parties who may benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry. However, these measures may not be comparable to similarly labelled measures used by companies inside or outside the insurance industry. In addition, the information contained herein should not be viewed as superior to, or a substitute for, the measures determined in accordance with the accounting principles used by the Group for its audited consolidated financial statements or in accordance with GAAP.In compliance with the Guidelines on APMs of the European Securities and Markets Authority and as suggested by the Financial Reporting Council, as applied by the Financial Conduct Authority, information on APMs which the Group uses is described below. This information has not been audited.Effective from 1 January 2023, the Group adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement and IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts. These new accounting standards resulted in a change to some of the Group's longstanding APMs. Comparatives have been restated to reflect the consistent application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, and to align with the current definition of the APMs.All amounts, excluding share data, ratios, percentages, or where otherwise stated, are in millions of U.S. dollars.Net insurance ratio:Ratio, in per cent, of net insurance expenses to net insurance revenue. Net insurance expenses represent the insurance service expenses less amounts recoverable from reinsurers. Net insurance revenue represents insurance revenue less allocation of reinsurance premium. This ratio gives an indication of the underlying profitability per $1.00 of net insurance revenue in the financial year.Operating expense ratio:Ratio, in per cent, of other operating expenses, excluding restricted stock expenses, to net insurance revenue. This ratio gives an indication of the amount of operating expenses expected to be paid out per $1.00 of net insurance revenue in the financial year.Combined ratio (discounted):Ratio, in per cent, of the sum of net insurance expenses plus other operating expenses to net insurance revenue.Combined ratio (undiscounted) (KPI):Ratio, in per cent, of the sum of net insurance expense plus other operating expenses to net insurance revenue. This ratio excludes the impact of the discounting recognised within net insurance expenses. The Group aims to price its business, to ensure that the combined ratio (undiscounted) across the cycle is less than 100%.Diluted book value per share ('DBVS') attributable to the Group:Calculated based on the value of the total shareholders\u2019 equity attributable to the Group and dilutive restricted stock units as calculated under the treasury method, divided by the sum of all shares and dilutive restricted stock units, assuming all are exercised. This shows the Group net asset value on a diluted per share basis for comparison to the market value per share.*Common voting shares outstanding comprise issued share capital less amounts held in trust.Change in DBVS (KPI):The internal rate of return of the change in DBVS in the period plus accrued dividends. Sometimes referred to as RoE. The Group\u2019s aim is to maximise risk-adjusted returns for shareholders across the cycle through a purposeful and sustainable business culture.*Calculated using the internal rate of returnTotal investment return (KPI):Total investment return in percentage terms is calculated by dividing the total investment return by the investment portfolio net asset value, including managed cash on a daily basis. These daily returns are then annualised through geometric linking of daily returns. The return can be approximated by dividing the total investment return excluding foreign exchange by the average portfolio net asset value, including managed cash. The Group\u2019s primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and provide adequate liquidity to support the Group\u2019s payment of claims and other obligations. Within this framework, the Group aims for a degree of investment portfolio return.*Calculated as the average between the opening and closing investments and our externally managed cash.Total shareholder return (KPI):The increase/(decrease) in share price in the period, measured on a total return basis, which assumes the reinvestment of dividends. The Group\u2019s aim is to maximise the Change in DBVS over the longer term, and we would expect that to be reflected in our share price and multiple. This is a long-term goal, recognising that the cyclicality and volatility of both the insurance market and the financial markets in general will impact management\u2019s ability to maximise the Change in DBVS in the immediate term. The total return measurement basis used will generally approximate the simple method of calculating the increase/(decrease) in share price adjusted for dividends as recalculated below.Gross premiums written:The Group adopted IFRS 17 on 1 January 2023. Under IFRS 4, the previous insurance accounting standard, the Group reported gross premiums written on the consolidated income statement as amounts payable by the insured, excluding any taxes or duties levied on the premium, including brokerage and commission deducted by intermediaries and any inwards reinstatement premiums. The Group continues to report gross premiums written as a growth metric and non-GAAP APM.The table below reconciles gross premiums written on an IFRS 4 basis to insurance revenue on an IFRS 17 basis.* Numbers presented in the table above for the comparative period are as previously reported for the year ending 31 December 2022.Gross premiums written under management (KPI):The gross premiums written under management equals the total of the Group\u2019s consolidated gross premiums written, plus the external names portion of the gross premiums written in Syndicate 2010, plus the gross premiums written in Lancashire Capital Management Limited on behalf of Kinesis Reinsurance Limited. The Group aims to operate nimbly through the insurance cycle. We will grow in existing and new classes where favourable and improving market conditions exist, whilst monitoring and managing our risk exposures and not seek top-line growth for the sake of it in markets where we do not believe the right opportunities exist.NOTE REGARDING RPI METHODOLOGYTHE RENEWAL PRICE INDEX (\u201cRPI\u201d) IS AN INTERNAL METHODOLOGY THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO TRACK TRENDS IN PREMIUM RATES OF A PORTFOLIO OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THE RPI WRITTEN IN THE RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS IS CALCULATED ON A PER CONTRACT BASIS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF RELATIVE CHANGES IN PRICE, TERMS, CONDITIONS AND LIMITS AND IS WEIGHTED BY PREMIUM VOLUME. THE RPI DOES NOT INCLUDE NEW BUSINESS, TO OFFER A CONSISTENT BASIS FOR ANALYSIS. THE CALCULATION INVOLVES A DEGREE OF JUDGEMENT IN RELATION TO COMPARABILITY OF CONTRACTS AND THE ASSESSMENT NOTED ABOVE. TO ENHANCE THE RPI METHODOLOGY, MANAGEMENT MAY REVISE THE METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE RPI, SO THE TRENDS IN PREMIUM RATES REFLECTED IN THE RPI MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE OVER TIME. CONSIDERATION IS ONLY GIVEN TO RENEWALS OF A COMPARABLE NATURE SO IT DOES NOT REFLECT EVERY CONTRACT IN THE PORTFOLIO OF CONTRACTS. THE FUTURE PROFITABILITY OF THE PORTFOLIO OF CONTRACTS WITHIN THE RPI IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS BESIDES THE TRENDS IN PREMIUM RATES.NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:CERTAIN STATEMENTS AND INDICATIVE PROJECTIONS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE MODELLED LOSS SCENARIOS) MADE IN THIS RELEASE OR OTHERWISE THAT ARE NOT BASED ON CURRENT OR HISTORICAL FACTS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING IN NATURE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, STATEMENTS CONTAINING THE WORDS \u201cBELIEVES\u201d, \u201cAIMS\u201d, \u201cANTICIPATES\u201d, \u201cPLANS\u201d, \u201cPROJECTS\u201d, \u201cFORECASTS\u201d, \u201cGUIDANCE\u201d, \u201cPOLICY\u201d, \u201cINTENDS\u201d, \u201cEXPECTS\u201d, \u201cESTIMATES\u201d, \u201cPREDICTS\u201d, \u201cMAY\u201d, \u201cCAN\u201d, \u201cLIKELY\u201d, \u201cWILL\u201d, \u201cSEEKS\u201d, \u201cSHOULD\u201d, OR, IN EACH CASE, THEIR NEGATIVE OR COMPARABLE TERMINOLOGY.

The shopping centre attracted 7.3 million tourists last year and by some (slightly dubious) measures is the most visited destination in Britain.</p><p>For many, this garish, mock English village lined with luxury shopping outlets would be a holiday in hell. But it has become an unlikely tourism hot spot in rural Oxfordshire, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/articles/bicester-village-day-trip-facts/\">particularly for Chinese visitors.</url></p><p>Bicester Village's streets of wood-panelled designer stores and red letter boxes have looked more like a ghost town since the coronavirus triggered<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/articles/bicester-village-day-trip-facts/\">a plunge in Chinese visitors</url>, however.</p><p>The virus is causing huge upheaval to holidaymakers and analysts warn it will deal a hammer blow to the world's tourism industry.</p><p>ING's analysts have estimated the slump in tourism will cost Asia alone between $105bn-$115bn (\u00a381bn-\u00a389bn) in 2020. Meanwhile, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/oxfordshire/articles/bicester-village-day-trip-facts/\">cancelled flights are expected to wipe out \u00a323bn of sales for airlines</url>, the bulk hitting Asian carriers, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicted on Thursday.</p><p>Tourism is now a much bigger part of the Chinese economy compared to similar contagions, such as SARS in 2003. Back then, tourism was only a 2pc slice of Chinese GDP but now it accounts for around 5pc.</p><p>Economists at Oxford Economics estimated earlier this month that there could be as many as 24 million fewer visitors to China if the outbreak was longer and more severe than SARS</p><p>Not only have holidaymakers been affected by most airlines cancelling their flights in and out of China but its burgeoning middle class have become vital tourists for other countries.</p><p>China is the world's largest outbound travel market in terms of spending, according to Oxford Economics.</p><p>By number of visitors, Thailand is the most exposed with over 10m Chinese tourists a year. South Korea, which is battling its own outbreak, is most exposed to China by share of the overall tourism market. Almost 35pc of its tourists arrive from China while Cambodia, Vietnam and Japan are the next most vulnerable, according to ING.</p><p>That could help tip Japan's ailing economy into recession after a sharp fall in GDP in the final three months of 2019, exacerbated by a VAT hike and Typhoon Hagibis.

Princesses Catherine Amalia, Alexia and Ariane.</p><p>Resplendent in their finery, the international crowd included the then Prince Charles and Camilla.</p><p>Europe's most glamorous women, from Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria to the then Princess Letizia of Spain and Denmark's Crown Princess Mary were also in attendance. </p><p>Guests from further afield included Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco, the princess consort of King Mohammed VI of Morocco.</p><p>When the last king of the Netherlands, William III, came to the throne in 1849 the group would have likely been considerably less international - made up mostly of European Royalty.</p><p>However, in 2013 the four corners of the globe truly were represented, with monarchs from nations such as Qatar in attendance.</p><p>Crown Prince Willem-Alexander became Europe's youngest monarch when he was inaugurated at 46.</p><p>His mother Beatrix, then signed the abdication deed after 33 years on the throne.</p><p>                     Willem-Alexander was officially sworn in as king of the Netherlands at a colourful ceremony in Nieuwe Kerk, a decommissioned church attended by 2,000 visitors from around the world and his proud 75-year-old mother, who has taken the title Princess Beatrix.</p><p>In a speech in the church, Europe's youngest monarch underscored the ceremonial nature of his monarchy in this egalitarian society but also the symbolic and economic value a king can deliver on state visits aimed at drumming up trade.</p><p>'I will proudly represent the kingdom and help discover new opportunities,' he said.</p><p>The investiture ceremony was the final formal act on a day of high emotion within the House of Orange-Nassau and was followed by an evening boat tour around the historic Amsterdam waterfront.</p><p>King Felipe VI </p><p>King Felipe took to the throne on 19 June 2014 after his father Juan Carlos tearfully signed his abdication papers on following a 36-year reign.</p><p>Determined to stay in line with the country's austerity measures, the monarch, his wife Queen Letizia and their two daughters - Leonor and Sofia - were ferried through Madrid in a low-key affair after a brief military parade to their first official engagement.</p><p>But the crowds were not unmanageable because the nation's vast republican faction was banned from protesting.</p><p>The ceremony, at Spain's lower house of parliament in Madrid, had little pomp and circumstance compared with royal handovers in other countries, to show an appreciation for the fact that more than one in four Spanish workers were jobless despite an incipient economic recovery.</p><p>It was more of a legal process, attended by lawmakers, high-level politicians and some members of the royal family with no foreign leaders invited. </p><p>Addressing parliament, Felipe VI called for a 'new Spain that we can build together'.</p><p>The king swore an oath promising to uphold the constitution.</p><p>The speaker of the lower house of parliament, Jesus Posada, then proclaimed him king, declaring: 'Long live Spain! Long live the king!'</p><p>In a speech to parliament, Felipe said he had 'great hope' for the future of Spain and called for unity.</p><p>'You will find in me a loyal head of state who is ready listen and understand, warn and advise as well as to defend the public interest at all times,' he said.</p><p>'The monarch wants to be close to citizens... ensuring it can preserve its prestige and dignity.'</p><p>'Now more than ever, citizens of Spain are rightly demanding fundamental ethical principles should govern our public life.</p><p>'The king should not only be a reference but who serves all citizens of Spain.'</p><p>He ended his speech by saying 'thank you' in three Spanish regional languages - Catalan, Basque and Galician.</p><p>Felipe wore military uniform with a sash and swear loyalty to Spain's constitution before addressing the chamber.</p><p>After the ceremony he was driven through central Madrid with his wife, Queen Letizia, a former journalist.</p><p>At the time the country was struggling to shrug off a double-dip recession and it hoped to drive down its 26 percent jobless rate.</p><p>Scandals tarnished the royal family and fueled campaigns to abolish the monarchy, while influential groups in some Spanish regions continued to push hard for independence.</p><p>In an oblique reference to separatist groups, Felipe insisted, 'We all have our place in this diverse Spain.'</p><p>Thousands of people lined the streets of Madrid streets as Felipe and Queen Letizia drove from parliament to the royal palace in an open-topped Rolls-Royce, waving to the crowds.</p><p>Authorities prohibited a demonstration by groups seeking to abolish the monarchy.</p><p>Later, a reception for 2,000 guests at the royal place featured finger foods instead of an elaborate banquet, a deliberately modest touch that acknowledged the financial hardships being endured by many Spaniards.</p><p>Felipe's father, Juan Carlos, did not attend the event to allow the spotlight to rest fully on the new monarch, according to the palace.</p><p>Japanese Emperor Naruhito </p><p>Japanese Emperor Naruhito formally proclaimed his ascendancy to the throne on 22 October 2019 at the Tokyo Imperial Palace. </p><p>The centuries-old ceremony was attended by dignitaries from more than 180 countries, pledging to fulfil his duty as a symbol of the state.</p><p>Naruhito became emperor and his wife Masako became empress on May 1 in a brief ceremony 'Sokui no Rei' was a more elaborate ritual at the royal palace in which he officially announced his change in status to the world.</p><p>'I swear that I will act according to the constitution and fulfil my responsibility as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people,' the Emperor declared in front of about 2,000 guests, including then Prince Charles.</p><p>'I sincerely hope that Japan will develop further and contribute to the friendship and peace of the international community, and to the welfare and prosperity of human beings through the people's wisdom and ceaseless efforts.'</p><p>The first Japanese emperor born after World War Two, Naruhito acceded to the throne when his father, Akihito, became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries after worrying that advancing age might make it hard to perform official duties. He is 85.</p><p>The long-planned celebrations, for which Japan declared a national holiday, were tempered by Typhoon Hagibis, which killed at least 82 people when it tore through Japan 10 days ago, and pouring rain early on Tuesday.</p><p>A public parade was postponed until next month to allow the government to devote its attention to the typhoon clean-up, while Tuesday's inclement weather forced the palace to scale back the number of courtiers in ancient robes taking part in the courtyard ceremony although the skies cleared as it began.</p><p>At the sound of a gong in the Matsu-no-Ma, or Hall of Pine, the most prestigious room in the palace, two courtiers bowed deeply and drew back purple curtains on the 'Takamikura' - a 6.5-metre (21 feet) high pavilion that weighs about 8 tonnes.</p><p>Naruhito was revealed standing in front of a simple throne, dressed in burnt-orange robes and a black headdress, with an ancient sword and a boxed jewel, two of the so-called Three Sacred Treasures, placed beside him.</p><p>Harvard-educated Empress Masako, was wearing heavy 12-layered robes and with hair flowing down her back, stood in front of a smaller throne to the side. Such traditional robes can weigh around 15 kilogrammes (33 pounds).</p><p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe delivered a congratulatory speech before assembled dignitaries including Crown Prince Akishino, the emperor's younger brother, and his family, all adorned in brightly-coloured robes. </p><p>Other guests included U.S. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao and Myanmar civilan leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p><p>Abe led a trio of cheers of 'banzai', or 'long life', for the emperor, before a 21-gun salute.</p><p>A court banquet was held on the evening, before Naruhito and Masako host a tea party for foreign royalty on the following day. </p><p>King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden</p><p>King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden will be attending King Charles coronation with his daughter Crown Princess Victoria.</p><p>The King, who celebrates 50 years on the throne this year, is Queen Elizabeth II's third cousin.</p><p>The king ascended the throne on September 15, 1973 and is the longest reigning monarch in Sweden.</p><p>The Swedish Royal Family is hugely popular in Sweden and the monarchy enjoys widespread support.</p><p>Throughout the year, the country's Royal Family will host a number of events to celebrate King Carl's Golden Jubilee.</p><p>Born on April 30, 1946, Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus Bernadotte was nine months old when his father, Prince Gustaf Adolf, was killed in a plane crash in Denmark.</p><p>He assumed the throne following the death of his grandfather, the long-reigning Gustaf VI Adolf.</p><p>The royal was enthroned in a lavish ceremony in the Throne Room of the Royal Palace of Stockholm. </p><p>After the Enthronement Ceremony, King Carl XVI Gustaf waved to the crowds from the Balcony of the Royal Palace of Stockholm. </p><p>King Carl and his wife of 47 years Queen Silvia share three children - Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, 45, Prince Carl Philip of Sweden, Duke of V\u00e4rmland, 43, and Princess Madeleine of Sweden, Duchess of H\u00e4lsingland and G\u00e4strikland, 40.</p><p>Seen as a progressive monarch, King Carl insisted Swedish law be changed in 1979 to allow his eldest daughter to succeed him rather than his only son - with the UK following suit in 2011.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-93103892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:685F-4Y41-DY4H-K42C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1763\"/><timeReceived>4:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

It was meant to be the next phase in the former Ulster player's professional career.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 27-year-old Canada international had agreed terms with the Seattle Seawolves - where ex-colleague at Ulster David Busby is based - and was ready to fly out last month and play in America's Major League Rugby programme up to its intended conclusion in mid-June.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it wasn't to be and, instead of togging out in San Diego today and clocking up the air miles by criss-crossing the country to play in various places including Houston, New York and New England, Nelson is still at home in Northern Ireland, with the US season now, naturally, abandoned.</p><p>His plan now is to try and land a professional deal with a club on this side of the pond - which was his intention anyway had he completed his stint in Seattle - although clearly not being in any shop window, and with so much uncertainty surrounding when the game will pick up again, never mind what financial shape it might be in, all makes things rather <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.complicated.No\">www.complicated.No</url> better time, then, to reflect on what has been a dramatic year for the 60-times-capped Ulster utility back, which has taken him from leaving the Kingspan last May to the absolute highlight of playing in the Rugby World Cup for Canada.</p><p>It hasn't all been rugby either as being in Japan when Typhoon Hagibis made landfall allowed the Dungannon man to witness its power and appetite for destruction. Their final group game with Namibia was cancelled and then Nelson helped, along with his Canadian team-mates, in dealing with some of the clear-up in the northern coastal city of Kamaishi.</p><p>\"We were gutted that our game was called off as it was one we'd been targeting to win,\" recalls Nelson, who had earlier played against and lost to Italy, the All Blacks and South Africa.</p><p>\"The day after it hit, we had beautiful weather and it was perfect to play, but the damage that had been done meant that the game just couldn't go ahead.</p><p>\"When we saw the damage to the place, it really put things in perspective.</p><p>\"When it hit, we had been in our hotel and it was right on the sea.</p><p>\"They had completely cleared the ground floor the evening before the typhoon was due.\"</p><p>\"We really didn't know what to expect,\" he adds of an uneasy time, \"but thankfully for the hotel, it wasn't as bad as they thought it could have been as there was only a small amount of water on the ground floor. Everything else was fine.\"</p><p>After venturing outside, the players decided they would do what they could to help the hard-hit local community.</p><p>Their assistance provided an image every bit as memorable as what occurred on the pitch during the tournament.</p><p>\"It had been pretty much destroyed by a tsunami several years before, then this typhoon hit,\" explains Nelson (left). He remembers being in one very elderly woman's home, or rather what was left of it after the water had subsided.</p><p>\"Some of the houses were completely destroyed, and we spent quite a lot of time at this lady's house. You could just see that the water had been halfway up the walls and she was, I think, in her 90s,\" he says.</p><p>\"She was trying to sort her house out, so we helped her clear her house and then just helped in the streets.</p><p>\"We didn't do an awful lot compared to what was being done by others. We just helped out where we could.\"</p><p>While the memory of the typhoon's aftermath and its impact on the local population, will always stay with him, the experience of actually playing in the tournament is an undoubted career highlight.</p><p>\"Being there was incredible,\" says Nelson, who qualifies to play for Canada through his grandmother and who hooked up with them straight after finishing his eight years with Ulster last May.</p><p>\"It was very special. The whole country was just amazing and it was just a brilliant experience for me.</p><p>\"I loved every minute of it and I got to play against South Africa, who went on to become world champions, and New Zealand.\"</p><p>Though Canada suffered heavy defeats in both group games, the experience of going toe-to-toe with two of the world's best sides was an intensely exciting challenge, especially with his parents and other family members having made it out to Japan.</p><p>An interesting footnote to his game with the All Blacks was coming up against Angus Ta'avao, who had coached him at Royal SchoolDungannon when the prop had been on an exchange.</p><p>Not only that but Nelson swapped jerseys with opposing fly-halves All Black Richie Mo'unga and Springbok Elton Jantjies. Both shirts are now framed at his parents' home, along with his first Canada cap and the one presented to all World Cup players.</p><p>Not bad for a player who made his Ulster debut at Leinster on Boxing Day in 2011 and rarely got a consistent run as a starting player.</p><p>Since the World Cup, though, things haven't been so easy for him.</p><p>He had hoped to pick up some form of contract back in Europe in the wake of playing in rugby's premier tournament, but nothing materialised and he put his time in coaching at Dungannon - he might yet coach when the playing is over - and then turning out in a couple of AIL games for them after Christmas.</p><p>The Seattle deal offered a break in the routine, but with that gone Nelson (right) is just trying to stay fit while at his parents' house - no mean feat for any professional sportsman at this time - and hoping that something will turn up, whether it be in the UK, France or indeed Ireland.</p><p>Obviously, a lack of game time and recent exposure to attract potentially interested clubs is a problem, but Nelson is remaining upbeat. \"My main goal is to stay in professional rugby, but like everybody I'm on hold and just waiting to see what's happening over the next few months,\" he says.</p><p>Regardless of how things pan out, he will always have the World Cup, where he took on the best in the game and also helped out in another time of crisis.</p><p>Not bad for this talented but largely unheralded Ulsterman who got to play on the biggest stage of all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>HELPING HAND: Peter Nelson and his Canada team-mates muck in to assist residents of Kamaishi after Typhoon Hagibis struck during the World Cup in JapanWORLD IN MOTION: Peter Nelson on the charge for Canada against Italy at the Japan World Cup, and (right, from top) with former RSDungannon coach Angus Ta'avao after taking on New Zealand at the showpiece event, and going through the gears in training</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNLFE-159081252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNLFE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YN2-2WN1-DYTY-C46S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1023\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Sunday Life All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Life</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33668\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 12, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

In what is otherwise the least competitive pool - even though Japan and Samoa have had their giant-killing moments - Argentina have the potential to knock England's campaign off the rails right at the outset.</p><p>The Pumas meet England in the opening round in Marseille on September 9, and Jones should expect a much more exacting encounter than the last World Cup pool meeting at the Tokyo Stadium in 2019. On that occasion Argentina self-detonated, when, having promised \"a war\", their serially indisciplined lock, Tomas Lavanini, was red-carded with 18 minutes on the clock after decking Owen Farrell with a shoulder to the head. </p><p>Farrell recovered, but Argentina did not, conceding six tries in a 39-10 defeat. England went on to reach the final after one of the least demanding World Cup fixture lists on record, due to their last pool match against France being cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. </p><p>It meant that after early games against the outmatched Tongans and USA, followed by 14-man Argentina, England faced only two full-force fixtures. The first of them, the quarter-final against Australia, was not until a fortnight later. We know what happened thereafter against New Zealand in the semifinal, and South Africa in the final. </p><p>However, the 40-16 quarter-final win over the Wallabies was notable for being Jones' seventh England victory in a row over Cheika, during a stint as Australia coach which started with him taking Australia to the 2015 World Cup final. Four years later the ledger of losses to his former club-mate at Randwick in Sydney was a bitter pill for Cheika to swallow, and he resigned as Wallaby coach soon afterwards.</p><p>Since then he has dabbled in rugby league, coaching Lebanon, the land of his forefathers, before returning to the 15-man fray after being appointed Argentina head coach three months ago. This followed a stint as a consultant coach to the Pumas alongside his old Argentine buddy Mario Ledesma, who had previously been his Wallaby forwards coach. </p><p>Cheika's desire to get back into international coaching will be driven by a desire for revenge against Jones which runs as deep as Deontay Wilder's dream of beating Tyson Fury. At this juncture it is also far more attainable, with Cheika's Argentina the first opponents England face at Twickenham in this year's autumn series. </p><p>On the surface, the Argentina that Cheika inherited from Ledesma might not appear to be in great shape, particularly after the mothballing last year of its Super Rugby franchise, the Jaguares, due to financial cutbacks and tournament reorganisation. </p><p>Delve a little deeper and it is soon clear that Argentina are far from being a spent force. This is because they have reverted to the overseas model that pre-dated the establishment of the home-based Jaguares in 2016, which saw many of their top players return to Argentina. </p><p>However, the most successful Pumas World Cup campaigns, in 2007 and 2015, were based on overseas-based squads, with most of them playing club rugby in Europe. In 2007, it saw Agustin Pichot's semi-finalists finish in third place after beating France in the bronze final, and Agustin Creevy's team blazed a similar trail in 2015 before losing in the semi-finals to Cheika's Australia.</p><p>The speed with which Argentina has reverted to this mainly European template is testament not only to the quality of its players, but, because, like the South Africans, they offer great value for money to clubs on both sides of The Channel due to the devaluation of their peso currency.</p><p>A trawl through the team rosters of clubs in the French Top 14, English Premiership, URC, and Super Rugby, shows that 42 of Argentina's leading players are currently overseas.</p><p>All but two play in Europe. The exceptions are Pablo Matera, the flanker who led Argentina to their first victory over New Zealand, in the 2020 Rugby Championship, before stepping down as captain due to racist social media comments he made as an U20 player. Matera is currently with the Crusaders, and was sent off controversially in the Super Rugby semi-final victory over the Chiefs on Friday, while veteran scrum-half Tomas Cubelli plays for Australia's Western Force in the same competition.</p><p>There are 17 Argentine internationals in France, with 15 in the Top 14. These include fly-half Nicolas Sanchez and blindside Marcos Kremer (Stade Francais), lock Guido Petti and winger Santiago Cordero (Bordeaux), hooker Facundo Bosch and tight-head Joel Scalvi (La Rochelle), centre Santiago Chocobares and wing Juan Cruz Mallia (Toulouse), and winger Juan Imhoff (Racing 92). </p><p>Cheika's new Pumas captain, Leicester hooker Julian Montoya, is one of 16 Argentines playing in the Premiership. Montoya has centres Matias Moroni and Juan Pablo Socino to keep him company at Tigers, while Gloucester also have a three-strong contingent of lock Matias Alemmano, full-back Santiago Carreras, and hooker Santi Socino. </p><p>Add to that another nine in the URC, among them flanker Tomas Lezana (Scarlets), scrum-half Gonzalo Bertranou (Dragons), full-back Emiliano Boffelli (Edinburgh), and tight-head Enrique Pieretto (Glasgow), and Cheika has players gleaning rugby know-how from all over Europe, and further afield.</p><p>The information the Argentine players glean from leading coaches in France and England, like Steve Borthwick, Ronan O'Gara, and Ugo Mola, as well as gaining inside knowledge on Six Nations players - with England in Pool D and Wales in Pool C top of the list as future opponents - is invaluable. </p><p>Cheika is a shrewd operator, as he showed after beating former Pumas fly-half star Felipe Contepomi to the Argentine job and then enlisting him immediately as an assistant coach. Cheika also has the accolade of being the only coach to have won the major club titles in the northern and southern hemispheres, taking Leinster to their first European Cup title in 2009, and the Waratahs to the 2014 Super Rugby title. </p><p>With Argentina, Australia, and Wales, to contend with, the 'easy' half of the 2023 World Cup draw might now not be quite as enticing to Jones as it was at first sight. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RUGPPR-trp12062022article131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RUGPPR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65NN-C821-DYNK-P012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Greenways Publishing Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Rugby Paper</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28507\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 12, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The O'Donovan brothers revelled in having to adapt, but others weren't able to.</p><p>So with strong winds forecasted, Sanita Puspure's Olympic single scull quarter-final has been brought forward from Monday to tomorrow.</p><p>Puspure won her heat in comfortable fashion at the Sea Forest Waterway in Tokyo early yesterday, winning with 8.13 seconds to spare over her Mexican opponent in second place.</p><p>Before that, Philip Doyle and Ronan Byrne will know if their Olympic flame still flickers after their surprising fourth and last place heat finish at the Sea Forest Waterway yesterday.</p><p>Silver medallists in the World championships two years ago, the pair were in very confident mood ahead of the Olympics but, as has happened before, they are taking time to click.</p><p>The repechage that took place early this morning was a chance to make amends, and to take a tougher but still achievable path to the final.</p><p>Before the sculls pair were in action, Puspure made an early statement in her bid for a first medal in three Games.</p><p>Ranked in the world's top four, she insists that she is keeping her eyes off the prize after a winning start, though she is clearly a live medal prospect and is into the as for now scheduled quarter-finals on Monday.</p><p>Back home in Ballincollig, her husband Kaspar stayed up to watch her win easily, but her two children, Patrick and Daniela, were sleeping.</p><p>\"I will talk to him,\" smiled Puspure. \"He is working tomorrow.\"</p><p>After a slow start she found her rhythm and her 8.13 second victory over Mexico's Kenia Lechuga in the six-boat race led Team Ireland's Twitter account to mischievously dub her 'dominant' Puspure.</p><p>It was a cheeky reference to the congratulatory press release sent out by then Minister for Sport Shane Ross after her World championship gold medal victory in 2018.</p><p>For Puspure, their was some satisfaction in her opening display.</p><p>\"It was OK, it was first race done,\" she said. \"The start could have been better but we will work on it.</p><p>\"Focusing on the next race now and taking it one race at a time, not thinking too far ahead, keeping calm, collected.</p><p>\"You don't think too far ahead, you focus on one race at a time and get through the rounds safely and you just think about the next race that you have to do and not the race that you might be doing in a week's time.\"</p><p>Having struggled initially with lockdown last year in terms of finding motivation to training, Puspure clicked into gear.</p><p>\"Yeah, it's been a long wait,\" she sighed.</p><p>Puspure's heat win was 11 seconds slower than that of New Zealand's Emma Twigg, one of her main rivals for a gold medal, but the conditions switched from cross headwind to a tail wind for Twigg's race.</p><p>Like the Irish athlete, the Kiwi is desperate to medal after missing out in the last two Games, when she was fourth both times. Twigg is the current world number one.</p><p>\"You can see the flags, it swings around a lot, so for our race I think it was a cross and a head wind,\" said Puspure.</p><p> \"But it changes very rapidly. So I think you just have to go with it and adapt as you go.  \"You're only racing five people when you race so you can't think too far ahead.\" </p><p>Puspure has enjoyed having the support of family, friends and supporters.</p><p>\"I read all the messages but I don't reply to them,\" she said.</p><p>\"But I soak in all the positive energy and positive vibes from home and I'll give it back to all the people who wish me well after the Games.</p><p>\"It wasn't too hard today but it's going to get harder as it goes along.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMRONL-74774959</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMRONL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636T-K811-JBNF-W0B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">418989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>irishmirror.ie</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"36679\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 24, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

I'm not thinking about anything else other than going over to France and playing rugby.</p><p>\"I'm not worried about it not going ahead. If you do that, then you won't prepare properly.</p><p>\"I would be pretty upset if we don't play. I want to play for my country, so I'd be pretty devastated on a personal level.</p><p>\"But again, if it's not safe to play, it's not safe, and if I have to go back to Gloucester and I'm not allowed to come back up if the game's the following week, that's out of my hands.</p><p>\"We've just got to crack on and focus on the week, not let that be a distraction.\"</p><p>There is a similar vibe to the week before Scotland's final game of the last World Cup against Japan, when Typhoon Hagibis was blowing through and the crucial contest in Yokohama was in doubt right up until the morning of the game.</p><p>\"Yeah, I suppose it was the same when we played Japan,\" recalled Harris.</p><p>\"I was still preparing and focusing on my role in that game then as well.\"</p><p>What remains of this game in Paris is Scotland attempting to knock off the third of their long disappointments in successive away games.</p><p>Wales fell at Llanelli for the first time since 2002, England at Twickenham for the first time since 1983, and now there's Paris, where the Scots last won in 1999.</p><p>\"It's the confidence and belief you take from those results,\" said Harris, adding: \"You think to yourself 'we can do this'.</p><p>\"We are full of confidence and still believe we can win the championship. We're not focusing too far ahead, but if we can beat France we've then got two home games to come so it's a good opportunity for us.\"</p><p>France will be without 11 players due to Covid-19 on Sunday if it goes ahead, including key men like Antoine Dupont and captain Charles Ollivon, but those coming in are not unknown to the Scots, says Harris.</p><p>\"France have a defensive system, an attacking structure and a style of play,\" he pointed out.</p><p>\"So we just look at that and how we deal with their threats and opportunities that are there for us. They're not going to be unknown players - this is international rugby. We don't know exactly what France are going to do, but we know their style of play and that's what we're going to focus on.\"</p><p>There have been no further positive tests among the French camp, leaving them with 11 players and four members of the coaching staff affected. None of the 11 players who tested positive will be involved on Sunday if the game is played, even if some, like Dupont, will have completed the isolation period.</p><p>Nonetheless France's training schedule has been disrupted and the Six Nations' Testing Oversight Group is to meet tonight to determine if the match should be postponed.</p><p>Their statement that the game should be rescheduled as soon as possible - probably the next week - brought a strident response from Scottish Rugby, who stand to lose as many as 11 England-based players as the second bye week on the championship schedule falls outwith the statutory windows for international player release.</p><p>Scottish Rugby have meanwhile confirmed their two remaining home games in the championship against Ireland (March 14) and Italy (March 21) will be played behind closed doors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>NO DOUBTS: Scotland centre Chris Harris isn't even contemplating the possibility of Sunday's game against France in Paris being postponed.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRESJO-167263496</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRESJO2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:622V-56D1-DYTY-C3DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"591\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Aberdeen Journals Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Press and Journal</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11988\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 24, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Business &amp;

To hold herself accountable, MacDonald started a blog - \"Let's Talk 1 per cent\" - where she documented one small change she was determined to make each month for the greater good of the environment. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From switching to shampoo and hair-conditioning soap bars as a way of cutting down on single-use plastics, to ordering locally produced vegetables and using bamboo toothbrushes, MacDonald has now conquered most sustainable swaps. There is one, however, that continues to evade her. </p><p>\"No, I haven't used reusable loo roll yet,\" laughs MacDonald when asked, \"but that's not to say I won't. I do use recyclable toilet paper.\" </p><p>Granted, washing reusable toilet wipes seems a pretty onerous responsibility for an international athlete given their nomadic lifestyle. But judging by MacDonald's competitive drive - she picked up a rugby ball aged 19 at university and just three years later was on England's books - it is surely only a matter of time before she ticks off that next goal. </p><p>The only downside to her career - if there is one - is trying to reconcile her eco-enthusiasm with the demands of life as a professional rugby player. \"When I'm at home, I have more control over what I'm buying and eating,\" she says. \"With a meal, I wouldn't start with a chicken and build around that - I'd much prefer a veggie lasagne or veggie sausages, because I actually prefer the taste of them.\" </p><p>When she is away with England, that routine is not so straightforward. Overnight stays in hotels, where catering is provided, limits what MacDonald can put on her plate, although she has counterbalanced that frustration by projecting her passion for sustainability onto her rugby peers. </p><p>\"In England camp, we might have bottles of water provided - but we'll request jugs of tap water to replace them,\" she says. \"We share cars as much as we can. I also try to buy as few boots as possible. I have one pair of boots and I wear them until they split and my feet are soaking wet when I stand on the pitch. It's difficult - and it's certainly not perfect by any means - but sport can still play a role while all the technologies around it continue to develop to allow us to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly in the future.\" </p><p>                                                                     View this post on Instagram                       <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COOCYjzA9OK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\">A post shared by Claudia MacDonald (@claud_macdonald)</url></p><p>MacDonald's sport is one of many that has already felt the disruptive force of climate change, when matches at the 2019 World Cup in Japan - including England's meeting with France - were cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. </p><p>More recently, the marathon at this year's Tokyo Olympics was moved because of concerns for athletes' welfare at the hottest Games on record. Scientists predict sport will face more disruption of this kind in the future and latest estimates show that by 2050, one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year. </p><p>It is little wonder, then, that last week Fifa, along with several other signatories, agreed to become net zero by 2040 - a move which is at odds with recent proposals put forward by football's world governing body to host a World Cup every two years. For MacDonald, there is also the small matter of women's rugby's delayed World Cup next year in New Zealand.</p><p>Should she make the squad, she would have no option but to board a long-haul flight - and it is partly why she admits to not fitting the definition of a true eco-warrior. \"International sport by its very nature requires you to travel, which is probably the highest contributor to CO2 emissions to what a team produces,\" says MacDonald, who will look to make an impact from the bench in England's second autumn meeting against the Black Ferns today. </p><p>\"The less travel we can do, the better. Unfortunately, we can't dictate what green technologies are available to fly to New Zealand, but we can still become more sustainable as a team.\" And yet, due to its growing profile, women's rugby is inadvertently proving more sustainable than other, more lucrative sports. </p><p>At her club, Wasps, MacDonald plays in the same set of kit for the entire season - and points to Harlequins' kit from last season which was made from recycled plastic. \"For internationals, you get a new shirt for each game,\" MacDonald explains. </p><p>\"Quite often we sign those shirts and give them to charities to raffle off as prizes, so they end up having a secondary life. It's not perfect, but they go to good causes and are reused in some way.\" </p><p>Reusable loo roll might still be on the to-do list, but MacDonald is carving out quite the reputation as the most sustainable scrum-half in rugby.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-77638790</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:641F-GVC1-JBNF-W02G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 7, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLON</classCode><className>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001458</classCode><className>MATERIALS RECOVERY &amp; RECYCLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DPQE</classCode><className>MEAT SUBSTITUTES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000823</classCode><className>HAIR CARE PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001458</classCode><className>MATERIALS RECOVERY &amp; RECYCLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DNZI</classCode><className>SINGLE USE PLASTICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DPQE</classCode><className>MEAT SUBSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

When they joined the Championship at the turn of the century, turning the Five Nations into Six, Italy were in the midst of the best period in their rugby history. They had the players, they had a growing supporter base, and they had already produced the results that seemed to make a long-term case for their inclusion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But those halcyon days are long gone, and an oppressive mediocrity has since settled on the national team like a heavy fog on a still day. To make matters worse for the Italians, Scotland, once the team most likely to lose to them, have enjoyed a marked improvement since Gregor Townsend took over in 2017. This may well be the most open Championship for years, but there still looks like being only one realistic contender for the Wooden Spoon.</p><p>If there is a source of optimism for them, it comes from the improved display of Benetton both in last season\\xE2s Rainbow Cup and in the URC this season, as well as from the emergence of some extremely promising young players such as the Treviso club\\xE2s uncapped centre Tommaso Menoncello.</p><p>Any drama?<br/><br/></p><p>The saga of Sergio Parisse looks like it could still have a couple of chapters in it after the great No 8 confirmed in December that he will make himself available for Italy again during what he has said will be his last season before retiring from the game. Now 38, the Toulon forward had been due to bow out of Test rugby at the 2019 World Cup, but what would have been his last match, against New Zealand, was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. Then he announced he would quit the international arena at the end of the 2020 Six Nations once he had had a chance to play one more time at the Stadio Olimpico - but the game against England was called off because of the Covid pandemic.\\xC2</p><p>That seemed to be the end of Parisse\\xE2s 142-cap career, he duly sat out the 2021 Six Nations, and last month Kieran Crowley left him out of the squad for the first two matches, away to France and at home against England. But the head coach also left the door open for a late comeback in the tournament, and the prospect of a final fling at home to Scotland in round four could be very tempting.\\xC2</p><p>Challenge\\xC2for Scotland</p><p>More or less the same as it has always been since Italy joined the Five Nations in 2000 and celebrated by winning their first-ever match against the Scots, who had gone to Rome as defending champions. The Azzurri always target the Scotland match as the one they have most chance of winning, and have often found a way of at least staying in contention until the closing stages.\\xC2</p><p>True, they have not won in the fixture since a 22-19 victory at Murrayfield back in 2015, but they lost by only four points at home in 2018. And, as both Edinburgh and Glasgow have found out against Benetton in the URC this season, an Italian side that is in the fight with 10 or 15 minutes to go visibly grows in confidence with every passing second.</p><p>Head coach</p><p>Former New Zealand international Kieran Crowley knows the game in his adoptive country well, having coached Benetton for five years before taking over the national side in 2021 from Franco Smith, who was shunted upstairs to become Italian rugby\\xE2s head of high performance. Now 60, the ex-All Blacks full-back made Benetton steadily more competitive during his time there, culminating in last season\\xE2s surprise victory in the Rainbow Cup.\\xC2</p><p>Crowley\\xE2s first Autumn Nations Series as Italy coach began in painfully predictable style as they lost to both New Zealand and Argentina, but they ended their campaign with a win against Uruguay. That was no surprise either, although it did demonstrate the squad\\xE2s ability to maintain a decent level of play.</p><p>Key man</p><p>As the only world-class player to have represented Italy, Parisse would clearly be the key man if he were to reappear in the side, such is his individual brilliance and the galvanising effect that his presence has on his team-mates. In his absence, however, much will be expected of stand-off Paolo Garbisi.

You speak about family all the time and there are things that happen in your life all the time.\"</p><p>Ford says coronavirus has caused minimal disruption to England's preparations for Wales' visit to south west London.</p><p>\"It's been a completely normal week. We went out for food together on Wednesday night,\" the Leicester fly-half said.</p><p>\"In terms of hygiene, not much has changed because we want to be pretty red hot on that anyway. It's just reminders more than anything to keep good habits around camp.</p><p>\"It's hard to believe, but we're genuinely just concentrating on the game.\"</p><p>Eddie Jones echoes Ford's view by claiming England's only aim is to topple their old rivals while tuning out the turmoil that has engulfed the Six Nations and other sports.</p><p>\"The only thing I'm focused on is Wales. There's going to be 82,000 people yelling and screaming, knowing we're going to play a really tough, positive game of rugby,\" Jones said.</p><p>\"We've probably had our best training run of the Six Nations. We're not far underneath where we were at the World Cup now in terms of physical condition and the intensity we can potentially play with.\"</p><p>Jones has targeted today's showdown for England to peak in the 2020 Six Nations and the Australian has a score to settle.</p><p>A year ago England were powering towards the Grand Slam as they followed up emphatic victories over Ireland and France by building a 10-3 half-time lead in Cardiff that eventually spiralled into a 21-13 defeat.</p><p>Wales went on to be crowned champions and the setback at the Principality Stadium still rankles.</p><p>\"You never like to lose to Wales - and we lost last year. We were in the position we were in at half-time and we've learned from that,\" said Jones, who steered England into the Yokohama final where they lost 32-12 to South Africa.</p><p>\"That was one of the key games that got us in our best condition for the World Cup. It's still a game that I'm sure irks every player who played in it. It certainly irks me.</p><p>\"You've got to remember they beat us last year, so we owe them one. England-Wales games are a little bit different. They go down to the wire.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>George Ford, centre, warms up with team mates</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EVEGAZ-158174325</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EVEGAZ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCB-9SS1-JCBW-N25G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265310</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Evening Gazette</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 7, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GX351</classCode><className>CARDIFF, WALES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Scotland need to win this game to finish the series off on a high and take real momentum into the Six Nations in February.</p><p>Not that long ago, Scotland losing to Japan would have been unthinkable but that all changed in an incredible match in Yokohama on October 13, 2019.</p><p>That was the day that Japan beat</p><p>Gregor Townsend's side and knocked them out of the Rugby World Cup.</p><p>The hosts had beaten Ireland a couple of weeks before but it was still a chastening experience for anyone connected to rugby in Scotland, both on and off the pitch.</p><p>The Rugby World Cup was played in the typhoon season and they knew that there was a chance that one could make landfall at some point during the tournament. That day came just before Scotland were due to play a match they needed to win to qualify for the knockout stage.</p><p>Matches scheduled for October 12 were cancelled, with the results deemed a draw and each team receiving two points each.</p><p>Scotland knew that if their game with Japan was called off, their tournament would be over.</p><p>Japan's Scotland World Cup time they had the Scots. won the encounters going in</p><p>Scottish Rugby, with chief executive Mark Dodson to the fore, were furious at that prospect and did not cover themselves in glory when they made some insensitive comments about the staging of the game amidst a natural disaster that cost people their lives.</p><p>Scotland, in the space of one press release, became the most unpopular team in the tournament - with everyone wanting Japan to win.</p><p>With Typhoon Hagibis battering Yokohama and Tokyo, where my hotel was, I went to bed fully expecting the game to be off due, quite simply, to the sheer amount of rainfall that landed on Yokohama in such a short period of time.</p><p>Remarkably, it got the go-ahead on the morning of the game and when I got to the stadium, you would not have known that a super-typhoon, as it had been upgraded to, had hit the day before.</p><p>It was a genuine privilege to be in the stadium to see a nation, through sport, united after such a devastating event, which killed 96 people.</p><p>Even though everyone wanted the hosts to win, Scotland acquitted themselves well. Japan were just that bit better.</p><p>Two years on, however, I can trace the improvement that Scotland have made recently to that painful day in Yokohama.</p><p>You may remember that, ahead of the World Cup, it was a stated goal of the Scotland team to 'play the fastest brand of rugby in the world'. This proved to be very foolish and was never really attainable.</p><p>What was possible was to emulate how Japan played that day and in that tournament. They played quick when it was right to play quick; offloading out of the tackle, changing the angle of support, short passes to create space for the fast players. But they also slowed the game down when it was appropriate and played a more conservative style.</p><p>For years, we were obsessed with trying to emulate how the All Blacks played but there are huge differences in the physical size of the South Sea Islanders that make up most of the New Zealand team and we Scots.</p><p>over the 2019 the first ever beaten Scotland had seven prior to 28-21</p><p>Scotland have now landed on a style of rugby that suits the make-up of the squad and is very similar to how Japan will play today.</p><p>Contrast that to last week when both teams where at opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to playing rugby.</p><p>Townsend's side matched South Africa in the first half but were blown away in the second and it was a humbling experience.</p><p>Scotland are not up against the same physical challenge today but they will be up against a team that will attack them from all places so the defence will be challenged in a very different way.</p><p>Everyone knew that the Springboks were going to kick when in their own half, so the defence structure was formed accordingly.</p><p>Today, Japan could go from anywhere and so can Scotland, so it should be a really entertaining game but it is one the home side have to win.</p><p>There is no shame in trying to emulate how Japan played back in 2019. If Townsend can get his back division playing with that speed and purpose, then it'll be the Scots who are celebrating this time.</p><p>1 Japan's victory over Scotland in the 2019 World Cup was the first time they had ever beaten the Scots.

However, the coronavirus has now affected over 71,000 people worldwide and the death toll has risen to 1,775, which inevitably keeps markets quite jittery,\" said analysts at ING.</p><p>On Monday, the People's Bank of China offered CHY200 billion, or USD29 billion, of one-year medium-term loans at a 3.15% interest rate, 10 basis points lower than previously. It also added CHY100 billion to money markets through reverse repurchase agreements.</p><p>In addition, China's ruling council will \"deliberate a draft decision\" over postponing the 10-day National People's Congress, said official news agency Xinhua, ahead of the meeting due to start on March 5.</p><p>ING continued: \"The [US] dollar appears well positioned to remain the currency of choice this week then, especially as signals about the soundness of the US economy continue to mount.\"</p><p>The euro stood at USD1.0835 Monday afternoon, lower than USD1.0855 on Friday.</p><p>\"The fears around the coronavirus impact on the eurozone economy remain well in place while data this week should be in line with latest releases in providing a non-encouraging picture,\" said ING.</p><p>To come this week is the ZEW economic sentiment for Germany on Tuesday, but the main focus will lie on Friday's PMIs.</p><p>Sterling was quoted at USD1.3014 on Monday afternoon, soft compared to USD1.3020 at the same time Friday afternoon and traded at EUR1.2008 versus EUR1.1991.</p><p>Against the Loonie, the greenback was trading at CAD1.3232 Monday afternoon, soft versus CAD1.3245 on Friday afternoon. Against the Aussie dollar, the greenback was quoted at AUD1.4882 on Monday afternoon, up from AUD1.4828 on Friday.</p><p>Safe haven currency the Swiss franc was marginally higher on Monday. The dollar was quoted at CHF0.9815, firm from CHF0.9802.
