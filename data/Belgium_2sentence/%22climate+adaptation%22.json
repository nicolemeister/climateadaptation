Global climate patterns are changing, triggering slow changes in ecosystems and agricultural productivity or sudden onset disasters, including hurricanes, heat waves and droughts. Climate change will have a profound impact on population dynamics, but research shows that the reality is complex. In an effort to understand to what extent migration can represent a coping strategy for the communities hit by climate change impacts, JRC scientists analysed past trends and future population projections through the lenses of different climate scenarios.  <br/><br/>The EU is active in providing support and targeted relief to prevent the negative impacts of climate change and to foster adaptation strategies in the most affected regions. Besides its ambitious action on climate mitigation, climate adaptation is an absolute priority for the EU. In February, the Commission adopted a new Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change[1], setting out the path to prepare for the unavoidable impacts of climate change and become climate-resilient by 2050 in the EU and around the world. In 2020, close to 50% of the funding for developing countries was dedicated to either climate adaptation or cross-cutting action (climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives).

Almost half the Group's financing, \u20ac45 bn, went to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) hit hard by the pandemic. Financing from the European Investment Fund (EIF) accounted for \u20ac30.5bn of the total \u2014 also a record. </p><p><br/><br/>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the EIB Group has provided a total of \u20ac58.7bn to fight it and its economic consequences. <br/><br/>Some \u20ac27.6bn went to supporting the green transformation of EU economies. Meanwhile, EIB lending to EU cohesion regions reached \u20ac19.8bn, helping countries ensure a just transition to a green economy. <br/><br/>The European Guarantee Fund, created with 22 EU member states, has so far underpinned \u20ac174.4bn in additional financing to support European businesses recovering from the pandemic. <br/><br/>EIB Group financing for development and partnerships outside the European Union reached \u20ac8.1bn. The EIB's work in developing countries will get a boost starting this year, thanks to the founding of a new branch \u2014 EIB Global. <br/><br/>The EIB helped the COVAX initiative to provide vaccines to developing countries with \u20ac900million as part of Team Europe \u2014 1 billion doses have been delivered so far. <br/><br/>EIB President Werner Hoyer said: 'In the past two years, we have demonstrated that fighting the pandemic, financing the recovery and investing in climate action are mutually supportive goals.' <br/><br/>For the second year in a row, the EU bank focused on fighting the COVID-19 crisis while increasing its financing for green projects. The European Investment Bank Group (EIB Group) worked with partners in Europe and around the world to deliver a record \u20ac95bn in financing, a 23% increase from 2020 (\u20ac77bn).The European Investment Bank (EIB) provided over \u20ac65bn in loans, while the European Investment Fund (EIF) provided just above \u20ac30bn in guarantees and equity. <br/><br/>Financing hit the highest level in the EIB's 63-year history, largely due to additional resources provided by the \u20ac24.4bn European Guarantee Fund (EGF), which was established in 2020 with support from 22 EU member states to help Europe's economy (and in particular SMEs and mid-caps) deal with the economic impact of the COVID 19 pandemic. <br/><br/>The rise in financing volumes shows the key role the EIB Group has played in the European Union's massive response to the pandemic. EIB Group loans, guarantees and other financing instruments have complemented national resilience programmes, supported local authorities and provided affordable finance to public and private companies. From healthcare to small businesses, sectors most affected by the pandemic have benefited from EIB support. <br/><br/>At the same time, the EIB Group has intensified investments in the twin green and digital transition, implementing the Climate Bank Roadmap 2021-2025 approved by the Board of Directors in November2020. Financing for innovation, which will be key to the transition, reached a record \u20ac20.7bn. The EIB has adopted new targets for lending to support EU cohesion policies, committing more funds for projects in Europe's transition and less developed regions, where the green and digital transition could be more difficult. <br/><br/>Outside the European Union, the EIB continued to work with EU partners in the Team Europe effort. To support European Union policies globally, the EIB has created a new branch dedicated to international partnerships and development finance, EIB Global. EIB Global will begin operating this month.  <br/><br/>EIB President Werner Hoyer, speaking at the EIB Group's annual press conference on 27 January, said: 'In the past two years, we have demonstrated that fighting the pandemic, financing the recovery and investing in climate action are mutually supportive goals. There is no safe world without access to healthcare and vaccines and without a decisive shift to an economic model based on innovative, climate-friendly solutions. In 2021, our record financing volumes are testimony of Europe's impressive effort to roll back the pandemic and promote a green recovery in Europe and beyond. By creating a new arm, EIB Global, for our business outside the European Union, we are determined to support the green and digital transitions through Europe's global partnerships.' <br/><br/>Boosting health lending worldwide <br/><br/>As part of the COVID-19 response, the EIB Group last year increased its financing for the health and life sciences sector to almost \u20ac5.5bn. More than \u20ac1bn of this was EIF equity investment into health and life sciences funds. In 2020, the EIB approved a \u20ac100 million loan to BioNTech, the German company that developed the first COVID-19 vaccine in cooperation with Pfizer. In 2021, the EIB continued to support vaccine research and production as well as COVID-19 diagnosis and treatments. The EIB has also intensified its role in the COVAX initiative, which was started by the Gavi alliance to bring vaccines to developing countries. <br/><br/>'Just ten days ago, a plane touched down in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, to deliver the billionth vaccine dose under COVAX, which has now reached 144 countries in the world. Europe is exporting more vaccines than any other region in the world. And we are also backing the build-up of vaccine production capacities in less developed regions,' EIB President Hoyer said. <br/><br/>Overall, more than 780 million people around the world will benefit from improved health services, including COVID-19 vaccines, made possible by EIB financing. Some 10 million people will have access to safer drinking water, while 3.8 million will benefit from improved sanitation. <br/><br/>Record financing for small businesses, with a key role for the EIF <br/><br/>Almost half of EIB Group financing \u2014 \u20ac45bn \u2014 went to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) hit hard by the pandemic. The EIB, the EU bank, directed its financing to those who needed it most \u2014 healthy small businesses whose activity was severely curtailed by the crisis. The EIB allocates most of its financing to SMEs through lenders and other financial intermediaries, and the EIB and the EIF have significantly increased their cooperation with these partners during the COVID-19 crisis. Financing from the EIB Group benefited more than 430000 SMEs and mid-caps in Europe globally last year, and it sustained over 4.5 million jobs. <br/><br/>The European Investment Fund (EIF), the EIB subsidiary that supports high-tech startups and small businesses across Europe, was instrumental in reaching these volumes. In 2021, the EIF increased its committed financing almost threefold to a record \u20ac30.5bn (from \u20ac12.9bn in 2020). The EIF designs and develops both venture and growth capital, guarantees and microfinance initiatives. Through its activities, the EIF fosters EU objectives in support of countering climate change as well as fostering innovation, research and development, entrepreneurship, growth and employment. <br/><br/>The European Guarantee Fund provides crucial crisis support <br/><br/>The \u20ac24.4 billion European Guarantee Fund (EGF) was established in late 2020 by the EIB Group and 22 member states to help companies in the European Union, especially SMEs, recover from the pandemic-related crisis. EGF activity drove the rise in the EIF funding. The EGF rapidly scaled up operations during 2021. Since December 2020, the EIB Group has approved \u20ac23.2bn in financing with European Guarantee Fund backing, or 401 individual operations in all 22 participating countries. Investments to date are expected to mobilise \u20ac174.4bn. <br/>'The EGF is proving to be a success story,' President Hoyer explained. 'During 2021, the fund has gained momentum. Financial intermediaries across Europe have used the fund's guarantees to provide timely lifelines to small businesses that were coping with working capital and liquidity concerns, or did not want to give up their investment plans.' <br/><br/>EIB Global: a new partner for Team Europe <br/><br/>Outside the European Union, the EIB Group provided \u20ac8.1 billion of financing in 2021. The EU bank is active in more than 160 countries worldwide and is a key partner of Team Europe. Since 1958, the EIB has invested more than \u20ac1.5 trillion in more than 14,400 projects outside the European Union. It has financed projects in the public and the private sector, small businesses and large firms. <br/><br/>In line with the overall reform of the European Union's global presence and initiatives, the EIB has now decided to reform its activities outside the European Union and establish a branch dedicated to international partnerships and development finance. This branch will be called EIB Global. <br/><br/>EIB Global will bring together all of the EIB's resources and expertise gained outside the European Union under a clear management structure that can make a stronger, more focused contribution to Team Europe projects and initiatives. EIB Global will be assisted and supported by a Board Advisory Group, which will be established in the coming months. <br/><br/>In November, the EIB opened its first hub in Africa, in Kenya's capital Nairobi. More offices are planned, as the EIB strengthens its presence in developing countries. <br/><br/>'EIB Global is the natural evolution of our long-standing commitment outside the European Union. By creating a dedicated arm, we will be able to better focus on projects that have a strong impact locally, whether by enhancing digitalisation, promoting renewable sources of energy or building quality infrastructure that reinforces adaptation to climate change. EIB Global as part of Team Europe will be an instrument to establish stronger partnerships with local institutions and other multilateral development banks,' President Hoyer said. <br/><br/>Milestones on the road to the EU climate bank <br/><br/>At the same time, the EIB has been transforming itself into the EU climate bank, in line with the EIB Group Climate Bank Roadmap 2021-2025 adopted by the Board of Directors in November 2020. The share of EIB investments that went to climate action and environmental sustainability projects rose to 43% last year (from 40% in 2020), despite the COVID-19 crisis, bringing the EIB closer to its 50% target. <br/><br/>Taking into account operations using the EIB's own funds \u2014 without the EGF mandate that specifically targets SMEs hit by the pandemic \u2014 the EIB's climate action financing actually rose to 51%. <br/><br/>The EIB also reached two milestones in its Climate Bank Road Map. In October, just ahead of COP26 conference in Glasgow, the Board of Directors approved the EIB Climate Adaptation Plan and the Paris alignment for counterparties framework (PATH). The bulk of EIB climate lending currently goes to climate mitigation. With the Climate Adaptation Plan, the EIB is committed to tripling the share of its total climate financing dedicated to adaptation from 5% to 15%. With PATH, the EU bank has committed to an approach that takes into account the decarbonisation plans of clients. PATH provides a robust tool to help high-emitting companies adopt and implement decarbonisation plans. <br/><br/>'Our Climate Adaptation Plan and the Paris alignment of counterparties are key elements of our strategy. By increasing financing in adaptation, we help to build more resilient infrastructure around the world and, in particular, in regions that need it most because of their exposure to extreme weather. With counterparty alignment, we encourage companies to decarbonise, and this will accelerate the transition to a world with fewer or no greenhouse gas emissions,' President Hoyer said. <br/>New cohesion ambitions <br/><br/>Ensuring that no one is left behind is at the heart of the EU bank's raison d'tre, and we are strongly committed to supporting the objectives of the European Union's cohesion policy. In the last five years, the EIB has provided \u20ac90.8bn to projects supporting cohesion. In 2021 alone, financing for cohesion amounted to \u20ac19.8bn, equivalent to 41% of signed financing in EU countries that is supported by the EIB's own funds. <br/><br/>In October 2021, the EIB approved a new framework to increase lending to cohesion regions in 2021-2027. More specifically: <br/><br/> The EIB will aim to increase its financing for regions identified by the European Commission as less developed or in transition to 45% of annual EU lending by 2025. <br/><br/> The EIB will dedicate 23% of its annual EU lending to less developed regions (those with gross domestic product per capita of less than 75% of the EU average) by 2025. <br/><br/>EIB's cohesion action for 2021-2027 will focus on 145 EU regions, 67 transition regions and 78 less developed regions. <br/><br/>Record financing for innovation <br/><br/>Finally yet importantly, last year a record \u20ac20.7bn went to support innovation, the digital economy and human development. New technologies and solutions are needed to achieve the twin transition to a green and digital world. <br/><br/>One example of how financing in innovation pays off is the recent Northvolt announcement at the end of 2021. After succeeding in developing a lithium-ion battery, the Swedish company has signed deals with various European automotive manufacturers and announced the production of their first lithium-ion battery cell at the Northvolt gigafactory in northern Sweden. The EIB is a proud financier of Northvolt and supports a strong, independent European battery industry. <br/><br/>Background information <br/><br/>Documents and figures.[1] <br/><br/>The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the lending arm of the European Union and is owned by member states.

Located at the centre of the Eurasian continent, Kazakhstan strategically links the markets of South East Asia and Western Europe. <br/><br/>Its projected climate change impacts vary across the country but Kazakhstan has already begun to experience an increasing number of droughts, floods, landslides, mudflows and ice jams that affect agriculture,fisheries, forests, energy production, water, and health. <br/><br/>Changing rainfall patterns are increasing the intensity and frequency of droughts. With the majority of the country's topography classified as steppe, desert or semi-desert, climate change is placing an additional burden on the country's water resource management and the livelihoods of almost 13 percent of the population that lives in high drought-prone areas. Due to low rainfall, severe water shortages occurred in 2012 and 2014 as a result of the reduced water levels of two major rivers in the country. <br/><br/>The increasing occurrence of floods and associated mudflows have resulted in the displacement of thousands of Kazak people.Such events last year in the southern parts of the country impacted 51 settlements, inundated more than 2,300 houses, displaced around 13,000 people, and caused economic losses, estimated at US$125 million.Overall, almost one-third of the Kazak population lives in regions that are prone to mudslides, including the nearly 1.8 million citizens of Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty Recent climate projections predict that these will occur more frequently with the increase of torrential rains. <br/><br/>So, what are the climate challenges facing Kazakhstan? <br/><br/>Well, the over-reliance on oil production makes the Kazakh economy vulnerable to market forces tied to the demand for oil-based products so experts say that climate-proofing its economically-significant sectors will be required to deliver more sustainable and inclusive economic growth. <br/><br/>The development of a National Adaptation Plan is a step in that direction, which the government recognises as a fundamental process to future-proof its investments against the potential impacts of a changing climate <br/><br/>Kanat Bozumbayev, the country's Minister of Energy, says, 'In Kazakhstan, we are committed to climate-proofing our economically-significant sectors, to deliver sustainable andinclusive economic growth' and there have, without doubt, been some successes in the fight against climate change. <br/><br/>Kazakhstan has, for example, prioritised the reversal of desertification, water scarcity, and the degradation of land through reforestation and restoration of abandoned farmlands. <br/><br/>While such efforts are focused on mitigation, Kazakhstan is in the process of developing and capacitating climate change adaptation plans and integrating them into legislative and institutional arrangements. One example of an adaptation strategy currently being developed is the introduction of adaptive growing technologies to compensate for the expected decline in favourable climate conditions needed for spring crops. <br/><br/>ABrussels-based expert on climate change told this website, 'While Kazakhstan has a rapidly growing economy, the rural population and farmers outside of the main urban centres face significant climate change risks to their livelihoods stemming from increased aridity, water management challenges and extreme weather events. <br/><br/>'The average annual air temperature increased by 0.31C in the 10 years since 2000, with the most rapid warming was taking place in winter. The main shift that has occurred due to this rise in temperatures is the increasingly arid climate of Kazakhstan's desert and semi-desert areas, as well as locations adjacent to them. Degradation of glaciers has been recorded.' <br/><br/>There has also been an increasing number of forest fires, said to be linked to climate change. <br/><br/>Climate change may have a negative impact on the health of the population both because of intensification of thermal stress in southern regions and the spread of disease. <br/><br/>However, Kazakhstan increasingly recognises the importance of reducing the country's vulnerability to climate change and has started to expand its investments in climate change adaptation,notably its national communications to the UNFCC. <br/><br/>But, despite some progress, there is no escaping the risks posed by climate change. <br/><br/>Projected climate change impacts vary across the country and Kazakhstan has already begun to experience this in ways. <br/><br/>The COP26 summit will gather world leaders, civil society pioneers, activists and the youth to implement action towards achieving the goals provided in the Paris Agreement and the UN Framew On the eve of the event, COP26 Regional Ambassador for Europe, Central Asia, Turkey and Iran David Moran recently paid a visit to Kazakhstan to discuss the efforts to tackle climate change and the forthcoming conference. <br/><br/>At the meeting, the Kazakh government announced plans to develop and adopt a long-term strategy to low emissions and decarbonize the economy. Moron noted that Kazakhstan can contribute in a positive and ambitious way in terms of these commitments. <br/><br/>With an eye on COP26, Moran said, '#8216;Kazakhstan is also a major energy producer. We are looking for ambitious champions who can switch away from fossil fuels and coal in particular, to clean, renewable energy that can be inspiring to other countries as well.\" <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Like other leaders, he will come under pressure from summit organisers to commit to quicker emissions cuts and set a target date to reach carbon neutrality - a target set by Xi for 2060 in a surprise move last year. <br/><br/>But China will be unwilling to be seen yielding to international pressure for more ambitious goals, according to one environmental consultant, especially as it grapples with a crippling energy supply crunch[5] at home. Beijing is \"already maxed out\", said the consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the matter. <br/><br/>Though there has been no official announcement, analysts and diplomatic sources said few had been expecting Xi to attend COP26 in person. He has already missed several high-profile global summits since the COVID-19 outbreak began in late 2019, and didn't physically attend the Global Biodiversity Conference in China's Kunming earlier this month. <br/><br/>They also said Xi was unlikely to lend his physical presence - a virtual video appearance remains a possibility - to a meeting that had little prospect of any significant breakthrough, especially after China brushed off U.S. attempts to treat climate as a 'standalone' issue that could be separated from the broader diplomatic disputes between the two sides. <br/><br/>Rather than making more concessions, China and India's top priority is to secure a strong financing deal allowing richer countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitment to provide $100 billion per year to help pay for climate adaptation and transfer clean technology in the developing world. Xi did attend the Paris summit in person in 2015. <br/><br/>Although Xi has not travelled outside China since before the pandemic, he has made three major climate announcements on the international stage. <br/><br/>His unexpected net zero commitment came in a video address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2020. That announcement encouraged enterprises, industry sectors and even other countries to respond with their own net-zero action plans. <br/><br/>Xi also said in a message to the U.S.-led Leaders Summit on Climate in April that China would start cutting coal consumption by 2026. And he used this year's UNGA to announce an immediate end to overseas coal financing[6], a major bone of contention. <br/><br/>Like India, China has been under pressure to add more ambition to its updated \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) on climate change, which are due to be announced before the Glasgow talks begin. <br/><br/>However, the revisions are expected to focus on implementing the targets that have already been announced, rather than making them more ambitious. <br/><br/>China has repeatedly stressed that its climate policies are designed to serve its own domestic priorities, and will not be pursued at the expense of national security and public welfare. <br/><br/>Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Beijing-based non-government group that monitors corporate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, said China already had enough climate challenges to deal with and has little leeway to go further in Glasgow. <br/><br/>\"With all the headwinds and all the pledges that have been made, it is important to take stock and consolidate,\" he said. <br/><br/>\"It's not enough to put these (commitments) on paper,\" he added. \"We have to translate them into solid actions.\" <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/world-scrambles-contain-damage-greenhouse-gas-emissions-hit-record-2021-10-25/\">https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/world-scrambles-contain-damage-greenhouse-gas-emissions-hit-record-2021-10-25/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/its-down-world-leaders-honour-climate-pledges-says-uk-cop26-chief-2021-10-11\">https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/its-down-world-leaders-honour-climate-pledges-says-uk-cop26-chief-2021-10-11</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/uks-johnson-says-touch-go-whether-cop26-secures-agreements-needed-2021-10-25\">https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/uks-johnson-says-touch-go-whether-cop26-secures-agreements-needed-2021-10-25</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-indian-pm-modi-will-attend-glasgow-climate-conference-minister-2021-10-21\">https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-indian-pm-modi-will-attend-glasgow-climate-conference-minister-2021-10-21</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-behind-chinas-power-crunch-2021-09-29\">https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-behind-chinas-power-crunch-2021-09-29</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-overseas-coal-power-retreat-could-wipe-out-50-bln-investment-2021-09-22\">https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-overseas-coal-power-retreat-could-wipe-out-50-bln-investment-2021-09-22</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

So here is a timely recap of the main aims of COP26 - writes Nikolay Barekov, journalist and former MEP. </p><p><br/><br/>The summit seeks to place attention on the wellbeing of the planet and of people - meaning cutting fossil fuels, reducing air pollution and improving health worldwide. There will be a focus on phasing out coal worldwide and stopping deforestation. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Barekov.jpg\">https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Barekov.jpg</url> Nikolay Barekov  <br/><br/> One of the four stated COP 26 goals is helping countries to adapt to protect communities and natural habitats <br/><br/>The climate, of course, is already changing and it will continue to change even as nations reduce emissions, sometimes with devastating effects. <br/><br/>The 2nd COP26 adaptation goal seeks to encourage countries affected by climate change to: protect and restore ecosystems; build defences, warning systems and resilient infrastructure and agriculture to avoid loss of homes, livelihoods and even lives <br/><br/>The brownfield versus greenfield question is, many believe, one that cannot be ignored if species' decline is to be prevented. <br/><br/>Rebecca Wrigley, a climate expert, said, 'Rewilding fundamentally is about connectivity - ecological connectivity and economic connectivity, but also social and cultural connectivity.' <br/><br/>I have looked at the efforts being made, and still to be made, in four EU countries, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Turkey. <br/><br/>In Bulgaria, the Centre for the Study of Democracy says that the fastest and most cost-effective way to reach full decarbonisation of the Bulgarian economy will be to transform the electricity supply mix. This, it adds, will require the immediate (or fastest possible) shutdown of lignite thermal power plants and the 'unlocking of the country's huge renewable energy potential.' <br/><br/>A spokesman said, 'The following 3 to 7 years will be of crucial importance for the realisation of these opportunities and delivering the green economic transition in Bulgaria while simultaneously improving the well-being and quality of life of Bulgarian citizens.' <br/><br/>In late June, the Council of the European Union gave the green light to the first European climate law, following the adoption of the legislation by the European Parliament a few days earlier. The law is designed to reduce greenhouse emissions by 55 per cent (compared to 1990 levels) by 2030 and reach climate neutrality in the next 30 years. 26 member states voted in favour of it at the Council of the EU. The only exception was Bulgaria. <br/><br/>Maria Simeonova, from the European Council on Foreign Relations, said, 'Bulgaria's abstention on the European climate law not only isolates the country within the EU once again but also reveals two familiar shortfalls in Bulgarian diplomacy.' <br/><br/>Turning to Romania, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the central European nation has 'joined the fight against climate change and supports the implementation of the priorities in the field at regional, international and global level.' <br/><br/>Even so, Romania ranks 30th in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2021 developed by Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute, and Climate Action Network. Last year, Romania was at number 24. <br/><br/>The Institute says that, despite great potential in Romania's renewable energy sector, 'weak support policies, combined with legislative inconsistencies, keep counteracting a clean energy transition.' <br/><br/>It goes on to say that Romania 'is not moving into the right direction' when it comes to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy use.' <br/><br/>A summer of record-setting heat in southern Europe has set off devastating wildfires that have torn through forests, homes and destroyed vital infrastructure from Turkey to Greece. <br/><br/>The Mediterranean region is vulnerable to climate change particularly due to its sensitivity to drought and rising temperatures. Climate projections for the Mediterranean suggest that the region will become warmer and drier with more frequent and extreme weather events. <br/><br/>According to the average burnt area per fire, Greece has the most severe forest fire problems among the European Union countries. <br/><br/>Greece, like most EU countries, says it supports a carbon neutrality objective for 2050 and Greece's climate mitigation targets are largely shaped by EU targets and legislation. Under EU effort sharing, Greece is expected to reduce non-EU ETS emissions by 4% by 2020 and by 16% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. <br/><br/>Greece can point to improvements to energy efficiency and vehicle fuel economy, increases in wind and solar power, biofuels from organic waste, setting a price on carbon - and protecting forests. <br/><br/>The blazing forest fires and record heat waves witnessed across the eastern Mediterranean this year have highlighted the region's vulnerability to the effects of global warming. <br/><br/>They have also been raising pressure on Turkey to change its climate policies. <br/><br/>Turkey is one of only six nations \u2014 including Iran, Iraq and Libya \u2014 that have yet to ratify the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which signals a nation's commitment to reduce carbon emissions. <br/><br/>Kemal K\u0131l\u0131daroglu, head of the leading opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), says the Turkish government lacks a master plan against forest fires and states, 'We need to start preparing our country for new climate crises immediately.' <br/><br/>However, Turkey, which has set a 21% emissions reduction target by 2030, has made significant progress in areas such as clean energy, energy efficiency, zero-waste and afforestation. The Turkish government has also pursued a number of pilot programmes seeking to improve climate adaptation and resiliency. <br/><br/>The leader of the United Nation's COP 26 conference in Glasgow at the end of the year has warned that failure to act now on climate change will result in \"catastrophic\" consequences for the world. <br/><br/>\"I don't think there's any other word for it,\" warns Alok Sharma, the British minister in charge of COP26. <br/><br/>His warning to all participants in the conference, including Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Turkey comes amid ever rising concern about climate change. <br/><br/>Emissions continued to rise in the last decade and, as a result, the earth is now about 1.1C warmer than it was in the late warmest on record. <br/><br/>Nikolay Barekov is political journalist and presenter, former CEO of TV7 Bulgaria and a former MEP for Bulgaria and former deputy chairman of the ECR group in the European Parliament. <br/></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["Kemal K\u0131l\u0131daroglu, head of the leading opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), says the Turkish government lacks a master plan against forest fires and states, 'We need to start preparing our country for new climate crises immediately.

Vaccination efforts will also include Rohingya refugees from Myanmar currently hosted in Bangladesh. </p><p><br/>The financing will help Bangladesh to mitigate the health effects of the coronavirus pandemic and enable the country to strengthen its healthcare system and protect its people from COVID-19 with effective vaccines. These are all key preconditions for continued sustainable economic and social growth. <br/>Luxembourg supports the development of Bangladesh's health system since many years by financing the Non-Governmental Organisation like Friendship which operates medical stations across the country and supports Bangladesh in its vaccination campaign. Friendship is particularly engaged in the Jamuna/ Brahmaputra river area in the North of Bangladesh and in the costal belt in the South. The organisation promotes vaccination through an information and awareness campaign and provides logistical support in its roll-out, such as the registration of patients and the assistance in their transportation to vaccination centers. <br/>EIB President Werner Hoyer said:'We very much welcome this partnership and the real impact it's having on people's lives. This is the perfect example of partnerships that EIB Global is increasingly promoting around the world to make a difference where is most needed. Working with other EU organisations, countries, and partners as part of Team Europe increases our impact on the ground especially when it comes to global challenges like the COVID pandemic, climate change or food security.' <br/>Vice-President Christian Kettel Thomsen, who is responsible for operations in South Asia, said:'We are proud of the role and contribution of the EIB, the European Union, Luxembourg, and Bangladesh towards ensuring friendship, cooperation and sustainable development remain our reality. Investing in the health sector and in Covid-19 related projects has been a crucial part of EIB's support to combat the crisis, both inside and outside the EU.' <br/>The Ambassador of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to the European Union, H.E. Mahbub Hassan Saleh, said:'The EIB's loan to the Government of Bangladesh for procuring COVID-19 vaccines is the biggest and most significant development in the 22-year long journey of the Bangladesh-EIB partnership. The footprint of the EIB in Bangladesh is becoming larger and expanding into new areas, which would continue in the days ahead and contribute to greater socioeconomic development in the country. Climate change, infrastructure and renewable energy are some key areas of importance to Bangladesh and the European Union, where the EIB's involvement can be robust in the coming days.' <br/>Luxembourg's Minister for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Affairs, Franz Fayot, said:'The Luxembourg Development Cooperation has been supporting NGOs active in Bangladesh for years and can look back on a particularly good and successful cooperation. With FriendshipLuxembourg, for example, we work to strengthen marginalized communities in Bangladesh by improving their access to quality basic social services, such as health, sanitation and education. The importance of strengthening and stabilising health systems, and doing so on a global scale, was made particularly clear to all of us by the COVID-19 pandemic. Luxembourg will therefore continue its engagement, together with civil society, bilateral and multilateral partners, in supporting the most vulnerable, in Bangladesh and in its other partner countries.' <br/>FriendshipBangladesh Founder and Executive Director Runa Khan said:'The COVID-19 pandemic has shown all of us how fragile and interconnected our world is and that only through solidarity we will find solutions which can bring safety for all of us. With our programmes and actions in Bangladesh throughout the last two years, and with the support of the Government of Bangladesh, the Government of Luxembourg and our partners and friends throughout Europe, we are able to support the people of Bangladesh in the field and on the ground and share the faith and hope with them that our actions will make a difference to the lives of the people we serve.' <br/>FriendshipLuxembourg Chairman Marc Elvinger said: 'We are impressed by the overall vaccination rate that Bangladesh achieved within a relatively limited period of time. With the support of Luxembourg's Government and citizens, Friendship is able to contribute to ensuring effective access of people in rural areas of Bangladesh to vaccination and achieve vaccination rates in remote communities that are aligned with those of the rest of the country.' <br/>See the video 'Bridging the last mile' on Friendship's contribution to the Covid-19 vaccination campaign : FRIENDHSIP'S COVID-19 VACCINATION EFFORTS.mp4[1] <br/>Background information <br/>EIB Global[2]is the EIB Group's new specialised arm dedicated to increasing the impact of international partnerships and development finance.

The funds under the REACT-EU constitute additional resources for existing Cohesion policy programmes. </p><p><br/><br/>The measures under REACT-EU will bridge the gap between the emergency response and long-term investments by strengthening the resilience of healthcare systems, preserving and creating employment, in particular for young people, supporting the most vulnerable in our society, and providing working capital and investment support for small and medium-sized enterprises. <br/><br/>REACT-EU finances targeted measures for the green and digital transitions to quickly address the negative consequences of the outbreak, for example, through investments in energy efficiency, urban greening and digitalisation. <br/><br/>The disbursement follows the successful implementation of the first borrowing operation under NextGenerationEU. The \u20ac20 billion 10-year bond was the largest-ever institutional bond issuance in Europe and the largest amount the EU has raised in a single transaction. By the end of this year, the Commission intends to raise some \u20ac80bn in long-term funding, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills. <br/><br/>Cohesion and Reforms Commissioner Elisa Ferreira said: \"I am glad that Cohesion policy remains at the forefront of crisis response and recovery. REACT-EU was the first NextGenerationEU Instrument to be finalised, its programmes were the first ones to be adopted and it is now the first channelling support to our economy, businesses and workers. REACT-EU brings much needed additional investment firepower to existing Cohesion policy programmes to further stimulate a robust, fair and cohesive recovery.' <br/><br/>Budget and Administration Commissioner Johannes Hahn added: 'I am very happy that we succeeded to kick-start the NextGenerationEU issuances as scheduled. As of today money under NextGenerationEU is already used via REACT-EU to help our regions and cities recover from the pandemic and build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe.' <br/><br/>Reaching the real economy <br/><br/>The additional funds will be primarily channelled through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF), including the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI). Some of the new resources will also be used to top-up the European Fund for Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) for the 2014-2020 period. <br/><br/>To provide the maximum possible assistance to the member states, the conditions for the use of these additional resources have been simplified: <br/><br/> National co-financing is not obligatory - that means that the EU can cover 100% of the cost if Member States deem it necessary.Immediate liquidity in the form of an 11% pre-financing will help to ensure a quick roll-out of this support, preventing any bottlenecks.There is no ex-ante conditionality, nor any requirements for thematic concentration or allocation by category of region. The scope of support is wide and transfers between ERDF and ESF are possible.Projects dating back to 1 February 2020 can be retroactively reimbursed. <br/><br/> Ensuring transparency and accountability <br/><br/>To coincide with these first payments, a new REACT-EU dashboard has been launched on the Commission's Cohesion Open Data Platform, to provide up to date information on the use of the REACT-EU resources across the EU. Cross-cutting themes such as green, digital and specific measures for climate adaptation are highlighted, in addition to data on specific investment areas by fund. The dashboard was put in place to facilitate access to public data and to ensure transparency and accountability. <br/><br/>Background <br/><br/>NextGenerationEU is a temporary recovery instrument of some \u20ac800 billion in current prices to support Europe's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and help build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe. To finance NextGenerationEU, the European Commission - on behalf of the EU - will raise from the capital markets up to around \u20ac800 billion between now and end-2026: \u20ac407.5 billion for grants (under RRF, REACT-EU and other EU budget programmes); \u20ac386 billion for loans. This will translate into borrowing volumes of an average of roughly \u20ac150 billion per year. <br/><br/>REACT-EU is part of NextGenerationEU[1] and provides \u20ac50.6bn additional funding (in current prices) over the course of 2021 and 2022 to Cohesion policy programmes. Measures focus on supporting labour market resilience, jobs, SMEs and low-income families, as well as setting future-proof foundations for the green and digital transitions and a sustainable socio-economic recovery. <br/><br/>More information <br/><br/>REACT-EU: Fostering crisis repair and resilience on the Open Data Platform[2] <br/><br/>Recovery plan for Europe[3] <br/><br/>Press release: First issuance under NGEU[4] <br/><br/>Press release Commission's first funding plan[5] <br/><br/>Q&amp;#38;A diversified funding strategy[6] <br/><br/>Factsheet - NextGenerationEU - Funding strategy[7] <br/><br/>EU as a borrower website[8] <br/><br/>Primary Dealer Network[9] <br/><br/>@ElisaFerreiraEC[10] <br/><br/>@JHahnEU[11] <br/><br/>@EUinmyRegion[12] @EU_Social[13] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa\">https://ec.europa</url> .eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/stories/s/REACT-EU-Fostering-crisis-repair-and-resilience/26d9-dqzy/\">https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/stories/s/REACT-EU-Fostering-crisis-repair-and-resilience/26d9-dqzy/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2982\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2982</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2749\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2749</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_1702\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_1702</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/factsheet_1_funding_strategy_20.04.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/factsheet_1_funding_strategy_20.04.pdf</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower-investor-relations_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower-investor-relations_en</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower-investor-relations/primary-dealer-network_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower-investor-relations/primary-dealer-network_en</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ElisaFerreiraEC\">https://twitter.com/ElisaFerreiraEC</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JHahnEU\">https://twitter.com/JHahnEU</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/EUinmyRegion\">https://twitter.com/EUinmyRegion</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/EU_Social\">https://twitter.com/EU_Social</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["Projects dating back to 1 February 2020 can be retroactively reimbursed.

A sustainable blue economy is essential to achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal[2] and ensuring a green and inclusive recovery from the pandemic. </p><p><br/><br/>Green Deal Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans said: 'Healthy oceans are a precondition for a thriving blue economy. Pollution, overfishing and habitat destruction, coupled with the effects of the climate crisis, all threaten the rich marine biodiversity that the blue economy depends on. We must change tack and develop a sustainable blue economy where environmental protection and economic activities go hand in hand.'  <br/><br/>Environment, Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius said: 'The pandemic has hit the marine economy sectors in different, but profound ways. We have an opportunity to start afresh, and we want to make sure that the recovery shifts the focus from mere exploitation to sustainability and resilience. Thus to be truly green, we must also think blue.' <br/><br/>All blue economy sectors including fisheries, aquaculture, coastal tourism, maritime transport, port activities and shipbuilding will have to reduce their environmental and climate impact. Tackling the climate and biodiversity crises requires healthy seas and a sustainable use of their resources to create alternatives to fossil fuels and traditional food production. <br/><br/>Transitioning to a sustainable blue economy requires investing in innovative technologies. Wave- and tidal energy, algae production, development of innovative fishing gear or restoration of marine ecosystems will create new green jobs and businesses in the blue economy. <br/><br/>The Communication[3] sets out a detailed agenda for the blue economy to: <br/><br/> Achieve the objectives of climate neutrality and zero pollution notably by developing offshore renewable energy, by decarbonising maritime transport and by greening ports. A sustainable ocean energy mix including floating wind, thermal, wave and tidal energy could generate a quarter of the EU's electricity in 2050. Ports are crucial to the connectivity and the economy of Europe's regions and countries and could be used as energy hubs.Switch to a circular economy and reduce pollution - including through renewed standards for fishing gear design, for ship recycling, and for decommissioning of offshore platforms and action to reduce plastics and microplastics pollution.Preserve biodiversity and invest in nature - protecting 30% of the EU's sea area will reverse biodiversity loss, increase fish stocks, contribute to climate mitigation and resilience, and generate significant financial and social benefits. Environmental impacts of fishing on marine habitats will be further minimised.Support climate adaptation and coastal resilience - adaptation activities, such as developing green infrastructure in coastal areas and protecting coastlines from the risk of erosion and flooding will help preserve biodiversity and landscapes, while benefitting tourism and the coastal economy.Ensure sustainable food production - sustainable production of and new marketing standards for seafood, use of algae and seagrass, stronger fisheries control as well as research and innovation in cell-based seafood will help to preserve Europe's seas. With the EU sustainable aquaculture strategic guidelines[4] now also adopted, the Commission has also committed to growing sustainable aquaculture in the EU.Improve management of space at sea - the new Blue Forum for users of the sea to coordinate a dialogue between offshore operators, stakeholders and scientists engaged in fisheries, aquaculture, shipping, tourism, renewable energy and other activities will stimulate cooperative exchange for the sustainable use of marine environment. A report on the implementation of the EU Directive on Maritime Spatial Planning will be issued in 2022, following the adoption of national maritime spatial plans in March 2021. <br/><br/> The Commission will also continue creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy internationally following the international ocean governance agenda. <br/><br/>Financing the sustainable blue economy <br/><br/>The European Commission and the European Investment Bank Group, composed of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund (EIF) will increase their cooperation on a sustainable blue economy. The institutions will work jointly with Member States to meet existing financing needs to reduce pollution in European seas and support investment for blue innovation and blue bioeconomy. <br/><br/>The new European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund - especially with its 'BlueInvest' platform[5] and the new BlueInvest Fund[6] - will support the transition towards more sustainable value chains based on the oceans, seas and coastal activities. To further finance the transformation, the Commission has urged Member States to include investments for a sustainable blue economy in their national resilience and recovery plans as well as their national operational programmes for various EU-funds from now to 2027. Other EU programmes such as the research programme Horizon Europe will also contribute and a dedicated Mission on Oceans and Waters will be set up. <br/><br/>As regards private investments, agreed ocean-specific sustainability principles and standards such as the EU-sponsored Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Initiative[7] should be used in relevant investment decisions. <br/><br/>Background <br/><br/>The European Union's blue economy encompasses all industries and sectors related to oceans, seas and coasts, whether they are based directly in the marine environment (e.g. shipping, seafood, energy generation) or on land (e.g. ports, shipyards, coastal infrastructures). According to the most recent Blue economy report[8], the traditional sectors of blue economy provide 4.5 million direct jobs and generate over \u20ac650 billion in turnover. <br/><br/>Today's Communicaton replaces the Blue Growth communication[9] of 2012.

COP26 resulted in the completion of the Paris Agreement rulebook and kept the Paris targets alive, giving us a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. </p><p><br/><br/>Commission President Ursulavon der Leyensaid:\"We have made progress on the three objectives we set at the start of COP26: First, to get commitments to cut emissions to keep within reach the global warming limit of 1.5 degrees. Second, to reach the target of 100 billion dollars per year of climate finance to developing and vulnerable countries. And third, to get agreement on the Paris rulebook. This gives us confidence that we can provide a safe and prosperous space for humanity on this planet. But there will be no time to relax: there is still hard work ahead.' <br/><br/>Executive Vice-President and EU lead negotiator, FransTimmermans, said: 'It is my firm belief that the text that has been agreed reflects a balance of the interests of all Parties, and allows us to act with the urgency that is essential for our survival. It is a text that can bring hope to the hearts of our children and grandchildren. It is a text, which keeps alive the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. And it is a text which acknowledges the needs of developing countries for climate finance, and sets out a process to deliver on those needs.' <br/><br/>Under the Paris Agreement, 195 countries set a target to keep average global temperature change below 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C. Before COP26, the planet was on course for a dangerous 2.7C of global warming. Based on new announcements made during the Conference, experts estimate that we are now on a path to between 1.8C and 2.4C of warming. In today's conclusions, Parties have now agreed to revisit their commitments, as necessary, by the end of 2022 to put us on track for 1.5C of warming, maintaining the upper end of ambition under the Paris Agreement. <br/><br/>In order to deliver on these promises, COP26 also agreed for the first time to accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and recognised the need for support towards a just transition. <br/><br/>COP26 also completed the technical negotiations on the so-called Paris Agreement Rulebook, which fixes the transparency and reporting requirements for all Parties to track progress against their emission reduction targets. The Rulebook also includes the Article 6 mechanisms, which set out the functioning of international carbon markets to support further global cooperation on emission reductions. <br/><br/>On climate finance, the agreed text commits developed countries to double the collective share of adaptation finance within the $100 billion annual target for 2021-2025, and to reach the $100 billion goal as soon as possible. Parties also commit to a process to agree on long-term climate finance beyond 2025. The COP also decided to establish a dialogue between parties, stakeholders and relevant organisations to support efforts to avert, minimise and address loss and damage associated with climate change. <br/><br/>New EU Commitments <br/><br/>On 1-2 November, President Ursulavon der Leyenrepresented the Commission at the World Leaders Summit which opened COP26. The President pledged \u20ac1 billion in fundingfor theGlobal Forests Finance Pledge[1]on 1 November. On 2 November, the EU announced aJust Energy Transition Partnership[2]with South Africa and officially launched theGlobal Methane Pledge[3], a joint EU-US initiative which has mobilised over 100 countries to cut their collective methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. Presidentvon der Leyenalso kicked off theEU-Catalyst partnership[4]with Bill Gates and EIB President Werner Hoyer. <br/><br/>From 7 to 13 November, Executive Vice-President FransTimmermansled the EU negotiating team in Glasgow. On 9 November, Mr Timmermansannounced[5]a new pledge of \u20ac100 million in finance for the Climate Adaptation Fund, by far the biggest pledge for the Adaptation Fund made by donors at COP26. It comes on top of significant contributions already announced by Member States, and also confirms the EU's supporting role to the informal Champions Group on Adaptation Finance. <br/><br/>EU side events at COP26 <br/><br/>During the conference, the EU hosted over 150 side events at the EU Pavilion in Glasgow and online. These events, organised by a variety of countries and organisations from Europe and around the world, addressed a broad range of climate-related issues, such as the energy transition, sustainable finance and research and innovation. Over 20,000 registered to the online platform. <br/><br/>Background <br/><br/>The European Union is a global leader in climate action, having already cut its greenhouse gas emissions by over 30% since 1990, while growing its economy by over 60%. With theEuropean Green Deal[6], presented in December 2019, the EU further raised its climate ambition by committing to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. This objective became legally binding with the adoption and entry into force of theEuropean Climate Law[7]. The Climate Law also sets an intermediate target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This 2030 target wascommunicated[8]to the UNFCCC in December 2020 as the EU's NDC under the Paris Agreement. In order to deliver on these commitments, the European Commission presenteda package of proposals[9]in July 2021 to make the EU's climate, energy, land use, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. <br/><br/>Developed countries have committed to mobilise a total of $100 billion per year of international climate finance from 2020 until 2025 to help the most vulnerable countries and small island states in particular in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. The EU is the largest donor, contributing over a third of the current pledges, accounting for \u20ac23.39 billion ($27 billion) of climate finance in 2020. President von der Leyen recently announced an additional \u20ac 4 billion from the EU budget for climate finance until 2027. <br/><br/>For More Information: <br/><br/>Q&amp;A on the EU at COP26[10] <br/><br/>From ambition to action: Acting together for the planet (Factsheet)[11] <br/><br/>European Commission COP26 webpage and Side Events Programme[12] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5678\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5678</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5768\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5768</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5766\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5766</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5586\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5586</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5886\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5886</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/european-green-deal/european-climate-law_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/european-green-deal/european-climate-law_en</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdf\">https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdf</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_enhttps:/ec.europa.eu/clima/news-your-voice/news/delivering-european-green-deal-2021-07-14_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_enhttps:/ec.europa.eu/clima/news-your-voice/news/delivering-european-green-deal-2021-07-14_en</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_5482\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_5482</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_21_5485\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_21_5485</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cop26eusideevents.eu\">https://www.cop26eusideevents.eu</url>/ </p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

While the EU does everything within its power to mitigate climate change, domestically and internationally, we must also get ready to face its unavoidable consequences. From deadly heatwaves and devastating droughts, to decimated forests and coastlines eroded by rising sea levels, climate change is already taking its toll in Europe and worldwide. </p><p>Building on the 2013 Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, the aim of today's proposals is to shift the focus from understanding the problem to developing solutions, and to move from planning to implementation.European Green Deal Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans said: 'The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark reminder that insufficient preparation can have dire consequences. There is no vaccine against the climate crisis, but we can still fight it and prepare for its unavoidable effects. The impacts of climate change are already felt both inside and outside the European Union. The new climate adaptation strategy equips us to speed up and deepen preparations. If we get ready today, we can still build a climate-resilient tomorrow.'Economic losses from more frequent climate-related extreme weather are increasing. In the EU, these losses alone already average over  12 billion per year. Conservative estimates show that exposing today's EU economy to global warming of 3C above pre-industrial levels would result in an annual loss of at least  170 billion. Climate change affects not only the economy, but also the health and well-being of Europeans, who increasingly suffer from heat waves; the deadliest natural disaster of 2019 worldwide was the European heatwave, with 2500 deaths.Our action on climate change adaptation must involve all parts of society and all levels of governance, inside and outside the EU. We will work to build a climate resilient society by improving knowledge of climate impacts and adaptation solutions; by stepping up adaptation planning and climate risk assessments; by accelerating adaptation action; and by helping to strengthen climate resilience globally.Smarter, swifter, and more systemic adaptationAdaptation actions must be informed by robust data and risk assessment tools that are available to all - from families buying, building and renovating homes to businesses in coastal regions or farmers planning their crops. To achieve this, the strategy proposes actions that push the frontiers of knowledge on adaptation so that we can gather more and better data on climate-related risks and losses, making them available to all. Climate-ADAPT[1], the European platform for adaptation knowledge, will be enhanced and expanded, and a dedicated health observatory will be added to better track, analyse and prevent health impacts of climate change.Climate change has impacts at all levels of society and across all sectors of the economy, so adaptation actions must be systemic. The Commission will continue to incorporate climate resilience considerations in all relevant policy fields. It will support the further development and implementation of adaptation strategies and plans with three cross cutting priorities: integrating adaptation into macro-fiscal policy, nature-based solutions for adaptation, and local adaptation action.Stepping up international actionOur climate change adaptation policies must match our global leadership in climate change mitigation. The Paris Agreement established a global goal on adaptation and highlighted adaptation as a key contributor to sustainable development. The EU will promote sub-national, national and regional approaches to adaptation, with a specific focus on adaptation in Africa and Small Island Developing States. We will increase support for international climate resilience and preparedness through the provision of resources, by prioritizing action and increasing effectiveness, through the scaling up of international finance and through stronger global engagement and exchanges on adaptation. We will also work with international partners to close the gap in international climate finance.BackgroundClimate change is happening today, so we have to build a more resilient tomorrow. The world has just concluded the hottest decade on record during which the title for the hottest year was beaten eight times. The frequency and severity of climate and weather extremes is increasing. These extremes range from unprecedented forest fires and heatwaves right above the Arctic Circle to devastating droughts in the Mediterranean region, and from hurricanes ravaging EU outermost regions to forests decimated by unprecedented bark beetle outbreaks in Central and Eastern Europe. Slow onset events, such as desertification, loss of biodiversity, land and ecosystem degradation, ocean acidification or sea level rise are equally destructive over the long term.The European Commission announced this new, more ambitious EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Communication on the European Green Deal[2], following a 2018 evaluation of the 2013 Strategy[3] and an open public consultation[4] between May and August 2020. The European Climate Law proposal[5] provides the foundation for increased ambition and policy coherence on adaptation. It integrates the global goal on adaptation in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goal 13 action into EU law. The proposal commits the EU and Member States to make continuous progress to boost adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. The new adaptation strategy will help make this progress a reality.More information2021 EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change[6]Questions and Answers[7]Adaptation to climate change website[8]European Green Deal[9]Video stockshots on adaptation to climate change[10] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu\">https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:738:FIN\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:738:FIN</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/commission-launches-online-public-consultation-new-eu-strategy-adaptation-climate-change_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/commission-launches-online-public-consultation-new-eu-strategy-adaptation-climate-change_en</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1588581905912&amp;#38;uri=CELEX:52020PC0080\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1588581905912&amp;#38;uri=CELEX:52020PC0080</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/adaptation/what/docs/eu_strategy_2021.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/adaptation/what/docs/eu_strategy_2021.pdf</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_664\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_664</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu\">https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu</url>/ [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-193268\">https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-193268</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["There is no vaccine against the climate crisis, but we can still fight it and prepare for its unavoidable effects.

That is why leaders from 196 countries are meeting in Glasgow in November for a major climate conference, called COP26. But adaptation to climate change also comes at a price - writes Nikolay Barekov, journalist and former MEP. </p><p><br/><br/>Increasing awareness about economic costs of not taking measures regarding adaptation to climate change is an important part of adaptation policies. The economic costs of the results of climate change and the costs of not taking measures will be high on the agenda in Glasgow. <br/><br/>There are four COP26 goals, the third of which is under the heading of 'mobilising finance.' <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/r4KN4LeZ.jpg\">https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/r4KN4LeZ.jpg</url> Nikolay Barekov, journalist and former MEP.  <br/><br/> A COP26 spokesman told this website, 'To deliver on our goals, developed countries must make good on their promise to mobilise at least $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020.' <br/><br/>That means, he said, that international financial institutions must play their part, adding, 'we need work towards unleashing the trillions in private and public sector finance required to secure global net zero.' <br/><br/>To achieve our climate goals, every company, every financial firm, every bank, insurer and investor will need to change, says the COP26 spokesman. <br/><br/>'Countries need to manage the increasing impacts of climate change on their citizens' lives and they need the funding to do it.' <br/>The scale and speed of the changes needed will require all forms of finance, including public finance for the development of infrastructure we need to transition to a greener and more climate-resilient economy, and private finance to fund technology and innovation, and to help turn the billions of public money into trillions of total climate investment. <br/><br/>Climate analysts warn that, if present trends continue, the cost of global warming will come with a price tag of almost $1.9 trillion annually, or 1.8 percent of U.S. GDP per year by 2100. <br/><br/>EUReporter has looked at what four EU nations, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Turkey are currently doing - and still need to do - to meet the cost of tackling climate change, in other words meeting the objectives of goal number three of COP26. <br/><br/>In the case of Bulgaria, it says it needs \u20ac33 billion to start meeting the main goals of the EU Green Deal over the next 10 years. Bulgaria could be among those most affected by the decarbonisation of the EU economy. It accounts for 7% of the coal used in the EU and 8% of the jobs in the EU's coal sector. Around 8,800 people work in coal mining in Bulgaria, while those indirectly affected are estimated at over 94,000, with social costs at about \u20ac600 million per year. <br/><br/>Elsewhere, it has been estimated the more than \u20ac3 billion is needed in Bulgaria just to meet the minimum requirements of the EU's Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. <br/><br/>For it to complete the Green Deal, Bulgaria will have to spend 5% of the country's GDP each year. <br/><br/>Moving to Romania, the outlook is just as serious. <br/><br/>According to a report published in February 2020 by Sandbag EU, Romania could almost be said to be set for success in the EU's race to a net-zero economy by 2050. Due to several changes in the structure of the economy following the post 1990 transition, Romania has seen massive drops in emissions, being the fourth EU Member State to reduce its emissions the fastest against 1990 , although it is not on a predictable and sustainable trajectory to net zero by 2050 yet. <br/><br/>However, the report says that Romania is the country in South East European or Central East European with some of the 'best enabling conditions' for the energy transition: a diverse energy mix of which almost 50% of it is already greenhouse gas emissions free, the largest onshore wind farm in the EU and huge RES potential. <br/><br/>Report authors Suzana Carp and Raphael Hanoteaux add 'Yet, Romania continues to be one of the lignite intensive countries in the EU, and despite its lower share of coal in the mix than the rest of region, the required investment for its energy transition are not to be underestimated.' <br/><br/>This, they say, means that on the European scale, Romanians still pay more than their European counterparts for the costs of this carbon intensive energy system. <br/><br/>The country's Minister for Energy has estimated the cost of transitioning the power sector by 2030 to be some \u20ac15-30 billion and Romania, the report goes on to point out, still has the second lowest GDP in the Union and therefore the actual needs of investment for the energy transition are extremely high. <br/><br/>Looking to the future, the report suggests that one way of meeting the cost of decarbonisation up to 2030 in Romania could be through 'a smart utilisation' of ETS (emission trading scheme) revenues. <br/><br/>One EU country already seriously impacted by climate change is Greece which is expected to incur even more adverse effects in the future. Acknowledging this fact, the Bank of Greece has been one of the first central banks worldwide to actively engage in the issue of climate change and invest significantly in climate research. <br/><br/>It says climate change appears to be a major threat, as the impact on almost all sectors of the national economy 'is expected to be adverse.' <br/><br/>Recognising the importance of economic policymaking, the Bank has released 'The Economics of Climate Change', which provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the economics of climate change. <br/><br/>Yannis Stournaras[1], Governor of the Bank of Greece, notes that Athens was the first city in Greece to develop an integrated Climate Action Plan for both mitigation and adaptation, following the example of other megacities around the world. <br/><br/>MichaelBerkowitz, President of The Rockefeller Foundation's '100 Resilient Cities' said the Athens Plan is an important step in the city's 'journey to build resilience in the face of the myriad challenges of the 21st Century.' <br/><br/>'Climate adaptation is a crucial part of urban resilience, and we're excited to see this impressive step by the city and our partners. We look forward to working collaboratively to realize the goals of this plan.' <br/><br/>Another country badly hit by global warming this year is Turkey and Erdogan Bayraktar, Minister of Environment and Urbanization, warns Turkey will be one of the most impacted Mediterranean countries not least because it is an agriculture country and its water resources are rapidly diminishing.' <br/><br/>As tourism is important for its income, he says 'it is an obligation for us to attach the required importance on adaptation studies.' <br/><br/> According to climate experts, Turkey has been suffering from global warming since the 1970s but, since 1994, the average, highest day temperatures, even the highest night temperatures skyrocketed. <br/>But its efforts to tackle the issues is seen as currently blighted by con\ufb02icting authorities in land use planning, conflicts between laws, the sustainability of ecosystems and insurance regimes that do not reflect su\ufb03ciently climate change risks. <br/><br/>Turkey's 'Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan' calls for indirect \ufb01nancial policies for adaptation to climate change and supporting mechanisms.' <br/><br/>The Plan cautions that 'In Turkey, in order to adapt to the e\ufb00ects of the climate change, cost-bene\ufb01t accountings regarding adaptation at national, regional or sectoral level are not conducted yet.' <br/><br/>In recent years, a number of projects which aim at adaption to climate change have been supported by the United Nations and its subsidiaries so as to provide technical assistance and Turkey shares in the Clean Technology Fund25. <br/><br/>But the Plan says that, currently, funds allocated for scienti\ufb01c research and R&amp;#38;D activities in climate change adaptation activities 'are not su\ufb03cient.' <br/><br/>It says, 'There hasn't been research for conducting climate change impact analyses of the climate dependent sectors (agriculture, industry, tourism etc.) and determination of adaptation costs.' <br/><br/>'It is of great importance to build information on the cost and \ufb01nancing of climate chance adaption and to evaluate the road map concerning these issues more comprehensively.' <br/><br/>Turkey is of the view that funds for adaptation should be provided on the basis of certain criteria, including vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change. <br/><br/>The generation of 'new, adequate, predictable and sustainable' financial resources should be based on the principles of 'equity' and 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. <br/><br/>Turkey has also called for an international, multi-optional insurance mechanism to compensate for losses and damages that arise from climate induced extreme events such as droughts, floods, frost and landslides. <br/><br/>So, with the clock ticking fast in the run up to the global event in Scotland, it is clear each of these four countries still have work to do to tackle the huge costs involved in combating global warming. <br/><br/>Nikolay Barekov is a political journalist and TV presenter, former CEO of TV7 Bulgaria and a former MEP for Bulgaria and former deputy chairman of the ECR group in the European Parliament. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bis.org/author/yannis_stournaras.htm\">https://www.bis.org/author/yannis_stournaras.htm</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["Yannis Stournaras[1], Governor of the Bank of Greece, notes that Athens was the first city in Greece to develop an integrated Climate Action Plan for both mitigation and adaptation, following the example of other megacities around the world.

EU missions aim to tackle big challenges in health, climate and the environment, and to achieve ambitious and inspiring goals in these areas. </p><p><br/><br/>A novelty of Horizon Europe[2] and also an original concept in EU policy, bringing together several Commission services under the authority of nine College members, missions will support research to deliver on the Commission's main priorities and find responses to some of the greatest challenges we are facing today: fighting cancer, adapting to climate change, protecting the ocean, seas and waters, living in greener cities and ensuring healthy soil and food. They are a new tool that includes a set of actions, such as research and innovation projects, policy measures and legislative initiatives, to achieve concrete goals with large societal impact and within a specified timeline. Five missions will aim to deliver solutions to key global challenges by 2030: <br/><br/> Adaptation to Climate Change: support at least 150 European regions and communities to become climate resilient by 2030;Cancer: working with Europe's Beating Cancer Plan to improve the lives of more than 3 million people by 2030 through prevention, cure and solutions to live longer and better;Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030;100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030;A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030. <br/><br/> A Europe Fit for the Digital Age Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said: 'Today, we have launched five new missions. A mission is a new and innovative tool - a new way to work together withinHorizon Europe. Theyare also an original concept in EU policy.Themissions are commitments to solve some of the greatest challengeswe arefacingtoday:fighting cancer, adapting to climate change, protecting the ocean, seas and waters, living in greener cities and ensuringhealthysoil and food. It isa set of actions -research and innovation projects, policy measures and legislative initiatives, citizens' involvement -to achieve concrete goals with large societal impact. We want todeliversolutions to key global challengesby 2030!' <br/><br/>Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said: 'The response to the coronavirus pandemic has shown that we can only tackle our biggest problems with a collective effort rooted in research and innovation. This is also the starting point of the bold and ambitious EU missions. They will mobilise the enormous potential of the EU and rally instruments and policies to achieve important goals. And all this together with the citizens, who are involved from start to finish.' <br/><br/>With its Communication on EU missions[3] adopted, the Commission is giving them the go-ahead, after the approval of the missions' individual plans this summer. <br/><br/> EU missions inHorizon Europe and beyond <br/><br/> Missions are a new collaborative approach to tackle some of the main challenges of our times. They provide a mandate to achieve specific goals in a set timeframe. They will also deliver impact by putting research and innovation into a new role, combined with new forms of governance and collaboration, as well as with a new way of engaging with citizens, including young people. <br/><br/>For example, the Adaptation to Climate Change mission plans to make available \u20ac100 million for large-scale demonstrations to address major climate induced hazards, such as flooding, fitted to local circumstances. The Cancer mission plans to establish a novel joint governance model to ensure a systematic and effective integration of research, innovation and policy developments on cancer in Europe. The Ocean and Waters mission will create a network of lighthouses at sea and river basin scale to implement the mission and expand the networks of marine protected areas. In the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities mission, selected cities will involve their citizens in drawing up 'Climate City Contracts' to help reach climate neutrality by 2030. And with the Soil Deal mission people will be stimulated to participate in citizen science initiatives to collectively improve soil health. <br/><br/>Rooted in Horizon Europe[4], mission implementation will go far beyond research and innovation to develop new solutions and improve the lives of Europeans. Their novelty and added value is in operating as a portfolio of actions involving different instruments, business models and public and private investments at EU, national, regional and local levels. For missions to be successful, support from other European and national programmes will be crucial. Each mission will have a specific timeframe and budget tailored to its challenge and implementation plan. <br/><br/>EU missions connect directly to citizens, engaging them in their design, implementation and monitoring. Member States, regions and a wide range of public and private sector stakeholders will get involved to help ensure lasting outcomes for all EU citizens. <br/><br/>The missions support Commission priorities, such as the European Green Deal[5], Europe fit for the Digital Age[6], Europe's Beating Cancer Plan[7], An economy that works for people[8] and the New European Bauhaus[9]. For instance, Mission Climate is already a concrete element of the new Climate Adaptation Strategy[10], Mission Cancer of Europe's Beating Cancer Plan[11] and the Mission Soil is a flagship initiative of the Long-term Vision for the EU's Rural Areas[12]. <br/><br/>The Commission published a Special Eurobarometer on science and technology[13] on 23 September. The EU-wide survey's results testify to the popular support for science and innovation to find solutions to the challenges identified by the missions. For instance, Europeans overwhelmingly see health and green energy as the areas were science and innovation will have a positive effect on their lives in the next 20 years. <br/><br/> Next Steps <br/><br/> EU missions are launching today into their full implementation phase. The first Horizon Europe work programme[14] for 2021-22, published on 16 June[15], includes a set of actions that lay the ground for their implementation. It will be updated with a full research and innovation agenda by the end of the year. In parallel, missions will engage with participating regions, cities and organisations, as well as citizens in the Member States. <br/><br/> Background <br/><br/> Based on proposals[16] that top experts in the Mission Boards handed over to the Commission in September 2020, five missions were identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan.[17] Horizon Europe provides initial funding to missions of up to \u20ac1.9 billion until 2023. In October 2020, the Commission validated the five proposed missions. They entered a preparatory phase to develop five detailed implementation plans including objectives, ways of reaching them and indicators for measuring performance. The Commission assessed these plans against specific criteria[18]. <br/><br/> More information <br/><br/> Questions &amp;#38; Answers: EU missions[19] <br/><br/>Factsheets: <br/><br/> EU

Maar veel regeringen hebben nu wel de kans om een nieuw soort economie te scheppen.</p><h>3 graden warmer Hopen op Biden</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sinds 1995 komen aan het einde van elk jaar tienduizenden specialisten in klimaatbeleid, politici, journalisten en campagnevoerders van over de hele wereld samen. Ze zitten dan twee weken lang opeengepakt in een congrescentrum. Er wordt veel gepraat en weinig geslapen. De ene keer komen er honderden deelnemers bij elkaar in \u00e9\u00e9n auditorium, de andere keer zitten ze bovenop elkaar in kleine groepjes. Frisse lucht is een luxe. Er wordt gezellig samen gedronken en gegeten. En daarna vliegen alle deelnemers terug naar waar ze vandaan kwamen. Met andere woorden: de jaarlijkse klimaattop van de Verenigde Naties is een paradijs voor virussen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Het is dan ook geen verrassing dat de editie van 2020, de COP26, uitgesteld is tot november 2021. Vanuit het perspectief van de volksgezondheid viel die beslissing te verwachten. Ze is mogelijk ook een meevaller voor de Britse regering, die het evenement organiseert in Glasgow. Begin 2020 werd duidelijk dat premier Boris Johnson en zijn team hun handen vol hadden aan de brexit en dat ze op klimaatgebied wat glansloos voor de dag kwamen. Door het uitstel hebben ze een jaar langer de tijd gekregen om hun huiswerk te maken.</p><p>In de aanloop naar de COP26 komt het er vooral op aan de bijna tweehonderd regeringen die in 2015 het klimaatakkoord van Parijs ondertekend hebben, er dringend van te overtuigen om hun uitstoot nog forser te verminderen dan ze beloofd hebben. Voorlopig zijn alle nationally determined contributions(NDC) onvoldoende om een catastrofale klimaatopwarming af te wenden. Modellen wijzen uit dat de planeet tegen 2100 wellicht zo'n 3 graden warmer zal zijn dan in de pre-industri\u00eble tijd. Dat is veel meer dan het doel van het akkoord: 1,5 \u00e0 2 graden. De ondertekenaars moeten ambitieuzere NDC's voorleggen om dat op te vangen.</p><p>Voor het mondiale klimaatbeleid begon 2021 op 12 december 2020, de vijfde verjaardag van het akkoord van Parijs. Aangespoord door de recente verklaringen van de Europese Unie en China over het elimineren van alle of de meeste emissies tegen 2050, zullen meer landen soortgelijke nuldoelstellingen aankondigen.</p><p>In september 2020 kondigde de president van China, Xi Jinping, aan dat zijn land de uitstoot van koolstof, dus niet die van andere broeikasgassen, tegen 2060 zal terugdringen tot netto nul. Naar verwachting zullen zowel de Europese Unie als China de doelen voor halfweg de eeuw bij de Verenigde Naties registreren als deel van hun ge\u00fcpdatete NDC's. Hoe ze precies van plan zijn die torenhoge ambitie waar te maken, en hun doelstellingen voor 2030 te halen op het gebied van piekuitstoot (China) en een uitstoot die 55 procent lager ligt dan in de jaren negentig (EU), zal normaal worden bekendgemaakt met het veertiende vijfjarenplan van China en de Green Deal van de Europese Unie.</p><p>Net zo belangrijk zal zijn hoe landen op de Climate Adaptation Summit eind januari hun plannen uiteenzetten om zich aan te passen aan de onvermijdelijke gevolgen van een warmer klimaat, en hoe ze hun plannen voor het economische herstel na covid-19 uitwerken. Naar verwachting zal de pandemie in 2020 de mondiale CO2-uitstoot met bijna 8 procent doen dalen, vergeleken met wat ze geweest zou zijn zonder de mondiale recessie als gevolg van die pandemie. Of de uitstoot weer op zijn oude niveau zal komen, zoals na de wereldwijde financi\u00eble crisis tussen 2007 en 2009, zal afhangen van hoe landen hun kwakkelende economie zullen stimuleren. Sommige, zoals Nigeria, hebben al aangekondigd dat ze van plan zijn de subsidies voor fossiele brandstoffen geleidelijk af te schaffen als onderdeel van hun herstel. Andere, zoals Canada en Frankrijk, hebben klimaatvoorwaarden gekoppeld aan financi\u00eble steun. En de Europese Commissie is van plan 30 procent van haar herstelpakket aan klimaatmaatregelen te besteden.</p><p>Zulke stappen zullen een bijdrage leveren aan een wereldwijde omschakeling naar een groenere economie, en de temperaturen lager houden dan ze anders geweest zouden zijn. Maar ze volstaan niet. De herstelplannen van China en India voorzien nog altijd in stimulansen voor toekomstige steenkoolenergie, wat absoluut niet te rijmen valt met de doelstellingen van Parijs.</p><p>De grootste klimaatspeler die we in 2021 moeten volgen, is de verloren zoon Amerika, die onder de nieuwe president Joe Biden terugkeert. Op 4 november, de ochtend na de Amerikaanse verkiezingen, stapte het land officieel uit het Parijsakkoord. President Donald Trump had een halfjaar na zijn aantreden in 2017 de eerste stappen daartoe gezet. Joe Biden zal die beslissing terugdraaien zodra hij in het Witte Huis zit.</p><p>Hij is voorstander van een uitstoot van netto nul tegen 2050. Met die doelstelling, en de Europese en de Chinese toezeggingen, zou tegen dan 45 procent van de mondiale uitstoot teruggedrongen moeten zijn. Maar die deadline is nog ver weg. En als het presidentschap van Trump iets heeft aangetoond, dan is het wel dat de zorgvuldigste plannen gemakkelijk door een volgende regering tenietgedaan kunnen worden. Joe Biden zal op het gebied van klimaat moeten slagen waar Barack Obama gefaald heeft. En de basis daarvoor moet worden gelegd in 2021.</p><p>De auteur is redactrice milieu van The Economist</p>", "publisher": "Trends Magazine", "instances": ["Naar verwachting zullen zowel de Europese Unie als China de doelen voor halfweg de eeuw bij de Verenigde Naties registreren als deel van hun ge\u00fcpdatete NDC's.
