They also call for EU funding to be channelled to a green and just recovery in cities, especially to 'unlock the full potential' of leading cities that have made even higher reduction targets of 65%. The call follows the vote by the European Parliament in favour of higher targets and ahead of the European Council meeting on 15 October in Brussels. In an open letter to German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in her role as President of the Council of the EU, and President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the mayors say their proposal would be, 'a natural milestone on the road to a climate neutral continent by 2050'. Cities are a critical part of the European Green Deal, but cannot act alone. </p><p>'that's why we ask you to use EU funding and recovery policies to support leading cities aiming to do their part of this goal with an even higher reduction target of 65%. We will not be able to unlock the potential of Europe's cities without an ambitious EU policy framework in place,' reads the letter. The mayors, representing millions of Europeans, also call for: Significant investments in public transport, green infrastructure and building renovations to enable the transition in cities. The EU's recovery plan must be designed to deliver the highest political ambitions for emissions reductions; EU funding and financing to be channelled to where it is the most needed - Europe's cities - to boost the transformational power of urban areas for a green and just recovery, and; recovery funding for fossil-fuel intensive sectors to be conditional to clear decarbonization commitments. By adopting these measures, the letter concludes: 'You will be sending a clear signal that Europe means business on green recovery and supports strong climate action ahead of COP26.' Anna K\u00f6nig Jerlmyr, mayor of Stockholm and president of Eurocities, said: 'Cities are at the forefront of climate ambition in Europe and will be the engines of the European Green Deal. The EU must support them with a fit-for-purpose COVID19 recovery plan that directs massive investments to the green and just transition in cities.' The letter was co-ordinated through the Eurocities network.

The aim of the proposal is to support Member States, schools, higher education institutions, non-governmental organisations and all education providers in equipping learners with understanding and skills on sustainability, climate change and the environment. A new European competence framework on sustainability[2] published by the Joint Research Centre[3], also available today, maps out the competences needed for the green transition, including critical thinking, initiative-taking, respecting nature and understanding the impact everyday actions and decisions have on the environment and the global climate. </p><p><br/><br/>Promoting European Way of Life Vice President Margaritis Schinas said: \"Youth participation has been revolutionising the way we look at climate and the environment. Through our youth programmes, European Solidarity Corps and DiscoverEU, we promote the sustainability drive involving our youth. This is a step further in the work towards a better integration of sustainability in education.' <br/><br/>Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Commissioner MariyaGabrielsaid:'There is tremendous work being done right across Europe to help children, young people and adults learn about and engage with climate change, biodiversity loss and sustainability. Our goal is to build on these efforts and to work closely with Member States to place sustainability at the heart of education and training systems. All learners, from an early age need opportunities to understand and take action for environmental sustainability, to protect our planet and our future.' <br/><br/>The Commission's proposal calls on member states to: <br/><br/> Provide learners of all ages access to high-quality and inclusive education and training on climate change, biodiversity and sustainability;establish learning for environmental sustainability as a priority area in education and training policies and programmes in order to support and enable the sector to contribute to the green transition;encourage and support whole-institution approaches to sustainability which encompass teaching and learning; developing visions, planning and governance; active involvement of students and staff; management of buildings and resources and partnerships with local and wider communities, and;mobilize national and EU funds for investment in sustainable and green infrastructure, training, tools and resources to increase resilience and preparedness of education and training for the green transition. <br/><br/> When asked in a Eurobarometer survey, what should be the top priorities for the EU in the years to come, the young people's first reply[4] was the protection of the environment and the fight against climate change (67%) followed by the improvement of education and training (56%).This shows how important it is to act. <br/><br/>The 2021-2027 Erasmus+ programme[5] also places a strong focus on the green transition in education and training. For the 2022 annual work programme, priority will be given to projects developing green competences and skills, future-oriented curricula and planned approaches to sustainability by education providers. A specific call for large-scale projects[6] will provide funding to identify, develop and test innovative approaches to education for environmental sustainability. The Commission will also provide training opportunities and communities of practice for educators through School Education Gateway[7]andeTwinning[8]. The new European Education Area Portal[9] of the Commission allows for easy access to information on education and training in the EU, including specific information on green education. <br/><br/>Next steps <br/><br/>The Commission's proposal will be discussed by Member States and then adopted by EU education Ministers. The Commission will support the implementation of the Recommendation through learning and exchanges between Member States, stakeholders and partner countries. <br/><br/>Background <br/><br/>To prepare the proposal, the Commission consulted widely on the current state of play regarding learning opportunities for environmental sustainability in the EU. A public survey[10], which ran from June to September 2021, received over 1,300 responses as well as 95 position papers. Input was also gathered during a series of online consultation workshops with policy makers, teachers, youth organisations, social partners, researchers and other interested bodies and organisations. The consultations underlined the crucial role of education and training in helping people understand and take action on environmental sustainability. <br/><br/>In the public survey, 71% of respondents, ranked education and trainingas the most important sector in this regard, ahead of public bodies and governments (56%), and media (34%). Providing teachers, trainers, youth leaders and academic staff with quality professional development opportunities on the environment and sustainability was considered a main priority for action, along with making sustainability a cross-cutting issue in curricula and study programmes. <br/><br/>More information <br/><br/>Proposal for a Council Recommendation on learning for sustainability[11] <br/><br/>European sustainability competence framework[12] <br/><br/>European Education Area[13] <br/><br/>GreenComp[14] - The European sustainability competence framework on the Science Hub <br/><br/>Learning Corner[15] <br/><br/>School Education Gateway[16] <br/><br/>eTwinning[17] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://education.ec.europa.eu/document/council-recommendation-learning-for-environmental-sustainability\">https://education.ec.europa.eu/document/council-recommendation-learning-for-environmental-sustainability</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128040\">https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128040</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/jrc-publishes-new-competence-framework-support-learning-environmental-sustainability\">https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/jrc-publishes-new-competence-framework-support-learning-environmental-sustainability</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2224\">https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2224</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1326\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1326</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/document/erasmus-programme-guide-2022\">https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/document/erasmus-programme-guide-2022</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/resources/toolkitsforschools.htm\">https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/resources/toolkitsforschools.htm</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\">https://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://education.ec.europa.eu\">https://education.ec.europa.eu</url>/ [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12985-Environmental-sustainability-education-and-training/public-consultation_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12985-Environmental-sustainability-education-and-training/public-consultation_en</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://education.ec.europa.eu/document/council-recommendation-learning-for-environmental-sustainability\">https://education.ec.europa.eu/document/council-recommendation-learning-for-environmental-sustainability</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128040\">https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128040</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://education.ec.europa.eu/about\">https://education.ec.europa.eu/about</url> [ 14]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/greencomp\">https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/greencomp</url> [ 15]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://europa.eu/learning-corner/learning-corner_en\">https://europa.eu/learning-corner/learning-corner_en</url> [ 16]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/index.htm\">https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/index.htm</url> [ 17]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\">https://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

However, more than 390 million people are living below the poverty line, while less than 10% of 18-24 year olds are enrolled in some form of post secondary education or training. <br/>Investing in people is therefore seen as a key pillar of the upcoming EU-Africa strategy[5], announced by the European Commission in March, with priority given to the fight against inequality, young people and the empowerment of women. <br/>Chrysoula Zacharopoulou[6] (Renew Europe, France), who wrote the Parliament's proposals, emphasises the need to ensure access to quality education and provide young people, especially women and girls, with the necessary skills to access the job market. <br/>Decent working conditions are seen as key to providing prospects to the rapidly growing population. This goes hand in hand with inclusive social protection systems, measures against child and forced labour and a transition from the informal to the formal economy. The informal sector makes up nearly 86% of all employment in Africa.[7] <br/>The new strategy should also improve health care and strengthen national health systems, making them more resilient to future crises. MEPs want to step up EU-Africa collaboration on health research and innovation to boost local production of equipment and medicine. <br/>Reducing Africa's dependence on imports <br/>The EU-Africa relationship 'must move beyond the donor-recipient relationship', according to the Parliament report, emphasising the importance of supporting Africa's domestic production through sustainable investment. <br/>It also proposes boosting intra-African trade through the continental free trade area, investment in transport infrastructure and better access to global markets. <br/>Public-private partnerships and funding small and medium enterprises are considered essential, as these smaller firms represent 95% of businesses in Africa and the private sector is expected to be decisive in the post-Covid recovery. <br/>All agreements should be compatible with human rights, labour and environmental standards and in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals[8], said the report. <br/>The report also calls on international lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to do more to relieve the debt burdens of African countries, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. <br/>Partners for a green and digital transition <br/>Africa bears the least responsibility for climate change, but it is bearing the brunt of its impact: up to 118 million extremely poor people will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in Africa by 2030, if adequate response measures are not put in place, according to a 2021 report by the World Meteorological Organization[9], a specialized agency of the United Nations. <br/>The report urges a transition to a clean and circular economy through investment in sustainable transport, green infrastructure and renewable energy. It also stresses the need to protect Africa's unique biodiversity and indigenous communities, as well as ensuring fair and sustainable exploitation of raw materials, which account for 49% of EU imports from Africa. <br/>A partnership on sustainable agriculture should be at the centre of EU-Africa relations, say MEPs, in order to develop environment-friendly farming practices, strengthen the resilience of farmers and address food system failures, aggravated by the closure of borders due to the Covid crisis. <br/>The digital transformation will play a key role in the modernisation of the farm sector, but also education, employment, health and people's participation in political decision-making. <br/>A migration policy based on solidarity and shared responsibility <br/>Since 2015, the EU and African countries have developed a joint approach to managing migration flows, which has led to a reduction in irregular migration and improved cooperation on the fight against migrant smuggling. Yet significant challenges remain. Sub-Saharan Africa hosts more than a quarter of the world's refugees and Mediterranean crossings continue to cause loss of life and fuel criminal networks. <br/>MEPs stress that the new EU-Africa partnership must put the dignity of refugees and migrants at its heart, addressing migration as a shared responsibility between European countries of destination and the African countries of origin. They also emphasise the need to tackle the root causes of displacement, guarantee fair asylum procedures and establish a migration policy that would create opportunities for skilled and unskilled workers. <br/>Next steps <br/>The future partnership between the EU-Africa partnership will be discussed at the sixth European Union - African Union summit[10] in Brussels, on 17 and 18 February 2022. It will be the first summit held since 2017. <br/>Heads of state and government will be participating, along with policy experts, in a series of thematic roundtables on topics such as growth financing, vaccine production and climate change.

A sustainable blue economy is essential to achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal[2] and ensuring a green and inclusive recovery from the pandemic. </p><p><br/><br/>Green Deal Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans said: 'Healthy oceans are a precondition for a thriving blue economy. Pollution, overfishing and habitat destruction, coupled with the effects of the climate crisis, all threaten the rich marine biodiversity that the blue economy depends on. We must change tack and develop a sustainable blue economy where environmental protection and economic activities go hand in hand.'  <br/><br/>Environment, Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius said: 'The pandemic has hit the marine economy sectors in different, but profound ways. We have an opportunity to start afresh, and we want to make sure that the recovery shifts the focus from mere exploitation to sustainability and resilience. Thus to be truly green, we must also think blue.' <br/><br/>All blue economy sectors including fisheries, aquaculture, coastal tourism, maritime transport, port activities and shipbuilding will have to reduce their environmental and climate impact. Tackling the climate and biodiversity crises requires healthy seas and a sustainable use of their resources to create alternatives to fossil fuels and traditional food production. <br/><br/>Transitioning to a sustainable blue economy requires investing in innovative technologies. Wave- and tidal energy, algae production, development of innovative fishing gear or restoration of marine ecosystems will create new green jobs and businesses in the blue economy. <br/><br/>The Communication[3] sets out a detailed agenda for the blue economy to: <br/><br/> Achieve the objectives of climate neutrality and zero pollution notably by developing offshore renewable energy, by decarbonising maritime transport and by greening ports. A sustainable ocean energy mix including floating wind, thermal, wave and tidal energy could generate a quarter of the EU's electricity in 2050. Ports are crucial to the connectivity and the economy of Europe's regions and countries and could be used as energy hubs.Switch to a circular economy and reduce pollution - including through renewed standards for fishing gear design, for ship recycling, and for decommissioning of offshore platforms and action to reduce plastics and microplastics pollution.Preserve biodiversity and invest in nature - protecting 30% of the EU's sea area will reverse biodiversity loss, increase fish stocks, contribute to climate mitigation and resilience, and generate significant financial and social benefits. Environmental impacts of fishing on marine habitats will be further minimised.Support climate adaptation and coastal resilience - adaptation activities, such as developing green infrastructure in coastal areas and protecting coastlines from the risk of erosion and flooding will help preserve biodiversity and landscapes, while benefitting tourism and the coastal economy.Ensure sustainable food production - sustainable production of and new marketing standards for seafood, use of algae and seagrass, stronger fisheries control as well as research and innovation in cell-based seafood will help to preserve Europe's seas. With the EU sustainable aquaculture strategic guidelines[4] now also adopted, the Commission has also committed to growing sustainable aquaculture in the EU.Improve management of space at sea - the new Blue Forum for users of the sea to coordinate a dialogue between offshore operators, stakeholders and scientists engaged in fisheries, aquaculture, shipping, tourism, renewable energy and other activities will stimulate cooperative exchange for the sustainable use of marine environment. A report on the implementation of the EU Directive on Maritime Spatial Planning will be issued in 2022, following the adoption of national maritime spatial plans in March 2021. <br/><br/> The Commission will also continue creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy internationally following the international ocean governance agenda. <br/><br/>Financing the sustainable blue economy <br/><br/>The European Commission and the European Investment Bank Group, composed of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund (EIF) will increase their cooperation on a sustainable blue economy. The institutions will work jointly with Member States to meet existing financing needs to reduce pollution in European seas and support investment for blue innovation and blue bioeconomy. <br/><br/>The new European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund - especially with its 'BlueInvest' platform[5] and the new BlueInvest Fund[6] - will support the transition towards more sustainable value chains based on the oceans, seas and coastal activities. To further finance the transformation, the Commission has urged Member States to include investments for a sustainable blue economy in their national resilience and recovery plans as well as their national operational programmes for various EU-funds from now to 2027. Other EU programmes such as the research programme Horizon Europe will also contribute and a dedicated Mission on Oceans and Waters will be set up. <br/><br/>As regards private investments, agreed ocean-specific sustainability principles and standards such as the EU-sponsored Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Initiative[7] should be used in relevant investment decisions. <br/><br/>Background <br/><br/>The European Union's blue economy encompasses all industries and sectors related to oceans, seas and coasts, whether they are based directly in the marine environment (e.g. shipping, seafood, energy generation) or on land (e.g. ports, shipyards, coastal infrastructures). According to the most recent Blue economy report[8], the traditional sectors of blue economy provide 4.5 million direct jobs and generate over \u20ac650 billion in turnover. <br/><br/>Today's Communicaton replaces the Blue Growth communication[9] of 2012.

Find out how the Just Transition Fund will help. TheEU is committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2050[1]and has integrated the target across all its policies within theEuropean Green Deal[2]to tackleclimate change[3]. This ambitious target requires a transition to alow carbon economyand is challenging for regions relying mostly onfossil fuelsandcarbon-intensive industries. Find out more about the EU's fight against climate change[4]. To address the social, economic and environmental impacts of the transition, the European Commission proposed in January 2020 theJust Transition Fund, part of the\u20ac1 trillionEuropean Green Dealclimate finance plan[5]. The Parliament is expected to vote on the establishment of the Just Transition Fund during September's plenary session. </p><p>A timeline of the figures under negotiation [6][7][8][9] During a plenary session on 23 July,Parliament challenged the Council to justify the massive reductions in the budgets of the Just Transition Fund[10]and InvestEU in the context of the Green Deal -a long-term EU priority that should not be put at risk[11]. Who gets funding? All EU countries are eligible for funding, but resources will be concentrated on regions facing the biggest challenges: regions with high carbon intensity, heavily using fossil fuels (coal, lignite, peat and oil shale). The wealth of the country will also be taken into account. Moving to a new green era without leaving anyone behind During a meeting in July 2020, the regional development committee asked for abigger budget for the Just Transition Fund[12]and to extend its scope to sustainable investments in: Microenterprises and small and medium-sized, including start-ups and sustainable tourism; smart and sustainable mobility and environmentally-friendly transport infrastructure; projects fighting energy poverty, particularly in social housing, and promoting a climate neutral approach and low-emission district heating; green infrastructure, and; regeneration and decontamination of brown field sites and repurposing projects, when the 'polluter pays' principle cannot be applied. In addition the committee also asked for: A derogation for investments related to natural gas in regions heavily reliant on the extraction and combustion of coal, lignite, oil shale or peat; a substantial increase in the budget; co-financing of up to 85% of relevant costs for eligible projects targeting the most vulnerable communities in each region; 1% of the total for islands and another 1% for the outermost regions, and; a green rewarding mechanism for the countries reducing their greenhouse gas emissions fastest. Greek EPP member Manolis Kefalogiannis, the MEP responsible for steering the plans for the Just Transition Fund through Parliament, said: 'With an increased budget, we will be able to effectively support the regions that need it the most, but, above all, strongly support our citizens. We are moving into a new green era without leaving anyone behind.'Where the Just Transition Fund aims to investSmall and medium-sized enterprises as well as new firms; research and innovation; aAfordable clean energy, emission reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy; digitalization and digital connectivity; regeneration and decontamination of sites, land restoration and repurposing; the circular economy, including waste prevention, reduction, resource efficiency, reuse, repair and recycling; upskilling and reskilling of workers for alternative employment; job search assistance, and; transformation of existing carbon-intensive installations. Just Transition Platform In June, the Commission launched the Just Transition Platform[13], providing support to public and private stakeholders from coal and other carbon-intensive regions. It will include a database of projects and experts, sharing information and technical advice. Background In March 2018, the Parliament called for a comprehensive fund to be established tosupport a just transition in the energy sector[14]. In January 2020, theCommission proposed the Just Transition Fund[15]to support the regions that will be most affected by this transition. In July, EU leaders agreed on a smaller amount[16]for the recovery plan and the EU's budget for 2021-2027, which was strongly criticized by the Parliament.Find out more Just transition in EU regions:

The results show progress in many areas, but highlight the need for much greater effort to deliver commitments on implementation by member states. </p><p>Nature's capacity to clean the air and water, to pollinate crops and to limit the impacts of catastrophes such as flooding is being compromised, with potentially significant unforeseen costs to society and our economy. An EU-wide opinion poll[2], also published today (2 October), confirms that the majority of Europeans are concerned about the effects of biodiversity loss and recognize the negative impact this can have on human health and well-being, and ultimately on our long-term economic development.&lt;nl/&gt; The EU adopted a strategy to stop this loss of biodiversity by 2020. Today's assessment, which comes midway through the strategy, highlights that much more needs to be done on the ground to translate the EU's policies into action. Firstly, EU nature legislation needs to be better implemented by member states. More than three quarters of the important natural habitats in the EU are now in an unfavourable state, and many species are threatened with extinction. Halting biodiversity loss will also depend on how effectively biodiversity concerns are integrated into agriculture, forestry, fisheries, regional development and trade policies. The reformed Common Agricultural Policy[3] provides opportunities for enhanced integration of biodiversity concerns, but it will be the extent to which Member States put in place the measures, nationally, that will determine the success of the CAP. Ultimately, our natural capital needs to be recognised and appreciated, not only within the limitations of our protected areas, but more extensively throughout our lands and seas. The Commission is currently undertaking a fitness check[4] of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives to assess whether it is achieving its valuable objectives in the most efficient way.&lt;nl/&gt; Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Commissioner Karmenu Vella said: 'There are plenty of lessons to be drawn from this report - some good progress, and good examples to be emulated, but much more work is needed to close the gaps and reach our biodiversity targets by 2020. There is no room for complacency - losing biodiversity means losing our life-support system. We can't afford that, and neither can our economy.'&lt;nl/&gt; Restoring natural habitats and building green infrastructure remains a challenge for Europe. The EU Green Infrastructure Strategy[5] - once implemented - should deliver multiple benefits across a range of sectors including agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Invasive alien species are also one of the fastest growing threats to biodiversity in Europe, causing significant damage to agriculture, forestry and fisheries, costing the EU at least EUR\u00a012\u00a0billion a year. A new EU Regulation[6] has entered into force to fight the spread of invasive alien species and work is underway to establish a list of invasive species of EU concern by early 2016.&lt;nl/&gt; On the global scale, the EU greatly contributes to halting biodiversity loss. Together with its member states, it is the biggest financial donor for biodiversity conservation. The EU has taken initial steps to reduce indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, including wildlife trade, illegal fishing and to integrate biodiversity into its trade agreements. The new global Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development reiterates the need to deliver on global commitments in this area.&lt;nl/&gt; The publication of this mid-term review coincides with that of a Eurobarometer survey showing the concerns expressed by Europeans with regard to the current trends on biodiversity. At least three quarters of Europeans think there are serious threats to animals, plants and ecosystems at a national, European and global level, and more than half think they will be personally affected by biodiversity loss.&lt;nl/&gt; Background&lt;nl/&gt; The EU biodiversity strategy to 2020 aims to halt biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services, restore them to the extent possible by 2020, and help avert global biodiversity loss. It sets targets in six main areas: the full implementation of EU nature legislation; maintaining and restoring ecosystems and their services; more sustainable agriculture, forestry and fisheries; tighter controls on invasive alien species, and a bigger EU contribution to averting global biodiversity loss. The EU Strategy emphasizes the need to take full account of the economic and social benefits provided by nature contribution and to integrate these benefits into reporting and accounting systems. The Strategy also aims at delivering on global biodiversity commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity and contributes to the new global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&lt;nl/&gt; More information&lt;nl/&gt; The Mid-Term Review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 - Commission Report[7]&lt;nl/&gt; EU biodiversity strategy to 2020[8]&lt;nl/&gt; EU biodiversity strategy to 2020: brochure[9]&lt;nl/&gt; State of Nature 2015 Report[10]&lt;nl/&gt; Eurobarometer on biodiversity[11]&lt;nl/&gt; [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/comm2006/2020.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/comm2006/2020.htm</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/SPECIAL/surveyKy/2091\">http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/SPECIAL/surveyKy/2091</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/fitness_check/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/fitness_check/index_en.htm</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/ecosystems/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/ecosystems/index_en.htm</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/invasivealien/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/invasivealien/index_en.htm</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/comm2006/2020.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/comm2006/2020.htm</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52011DC0244\">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52011DC0244</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/info/pubs/docs/brochures/2020%20Biod%20brochure%20final%20lowres.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/info/pubs/docs/brochures/2020%20Biod%20brochure%20final%20lowres.pdf</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2015:219:FIN\">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2015:219:FIN</url> [ 11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/SPECIAL/surveyKy/2091\">http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/SPECIAL/surveyKy/2091</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["There is no room for complacency - losing biodiversity means losing our life-support system.

The auditors warn that major challenges remain in the much fuller integration of climate change, flood insurance and spatial planning into flood risk management. They are critical of weaknesses in allocating funding. </p><p>Flood events have become more frequent in Europe since 1985. In recent years, the trend shows that more than twice as many flash floods of medium to large magnitude have been registered as in the late eighties. As the climate changes, the EU is experiencing heavier rainfall, harsher storms and rising sea levels. According to the European Environment Agency, the consequences of fluvial, pluvial and coastal floods in Europe will overall worsen as a result of local and regional increases in the intensity and frequency of flooding. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other research indicate that rainfall events are likely to become more intense across Europe, and sea levels will continue to rise. Research shows that damage caused by flooding could rise to \u20ac20 billion a year by the 2020s, \u20ac46bn by the 2050s, and \u20ac98bn by the 2080s. The auditors checked whether flood prevention, protection and preparedness under the Floods Directive were based on sound analysis and whether the approach employed was likely to be effective. The auditors carried out visits to river basin projects in eight Member States - Slovenia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Bulgaria, Austria and the Czech Republic, as well as in the Netherlands. 'Major future challenges remain concerning the much fuller integration of climate change, flood insurance and spatial planning in flood risk management. Floods can cause injury, loss of life, considerable economic costs, damage to the environment and cultural heritage,' said Phil Wynn Owen, the member of the European Court of Auditors responsible for the report. 'We found that the EU's Floods Directive of 2007 had positive effects overall, but implementation plans suffered from weaknesses in allocating funding.' The auditors found that the Directive improved co-ordination between the member states and the Commission, particularly through the latter's supervisory and monitoring role, sharing of knowledge and best practices. They found that all member states visited have begun implementing the flood risk management plans, but that improvements are needed. The flood-related action suffers from weaknesses in allocating funds: the sources of financing were only partially identified and secured in the member states' flood risk management plans, funding for cross-border investment was limited, and money was generally not allocated in line with the priorities. In one river basin district, the auditors estimated a gap of over \u20ac1.1bn between planned spending and available financing. Most member states used cost-benefit analysis in order to achieve the best value for money from flood-related projects, but the auditors found weaknesses in its use. Two thirds of the member states did not focus in their plans on green infrastructure projects, which are a cost-efficient means of reducing flood risks. One member state planned to use grey infrastructure made of concrete to reinforce a six-kilometre long riverbank without considering green solutions. The auditors warn that major future challenges remain concerning the much fuller integration of climate change, flood insurance systems and land use planning into flood risk management. For example, the member states visited could not factor in the impact of climate change on the magnitude, frequency and location of floods. Moreover, they generally used historical data, which carries a risk of not reflecting future weather conditions or potential changes in the frequency and severity of floods. The auditors make a number of recommendations to the Commission: Check that member states improve accountability through quantifiable and time-bound objectives for flood-related action in their flood risk plans; assess whether member states identify financial resources to cover the needs arising from the flood risk plans, and set relevant timelines, including for cross-border action in international river basins; \u2022only co-finance measures prioritized on the basis of objective and relevant criteria, such as cost-benefit analysis and, where relevant, an assessment of cross-border impacts; enforce compliance with the Water Framework Directive for new floods infrastructure identified within member states' flood risk plans; whenever member states request EU funds for new proposed flood infrastructure, check whether they have examined the feasibility of implementing significant green measures; check that member states' flood risk plans include measures to improve knowledge and the tools necessary to understand the impact of climate change, including flash floods and rising sea-levels, and that they better integrate the effects of climate change into flood risk management; check whether member states have planned action to raise public awareness of the benefits of flood insurance and increase its coverage; check that member states have used their flood risk plans to assess the extent to which land use planning rules are adequately designed and enforced in areas at risk of flooding. Emergency and recovery action concerning floods was excluded from the scope of this study. It is not in the remit of the Floods Directive. The ECA will shortly issue a special report on desertification in the EU. The ECA presents its special reports to the European Parliament and Council of the EU, as well as to other interested parties such as national parliaments, industry stakeholders and representatives of civil society. The vast majority of the recommendations we make in our reports are put into practice. This high level of take-up underlines the benefit of our work to EU citizens.

One produces more evidence about the overall economic benefits from timely investment in defences against flooding, and the other highlights the advantages of moving the tax burden away from labour and towards resource use and pollution.</p><p><br/> Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik said: 'Investing in flood protection can bring overall benefits to the economy, especially through nature-based solutions which are highly cost-effective. And environmental fiscal reforms have the potential to almost double the revenues they currently bring to national treasuries, with benefits for our environment as well as scope for cutting taxes on employment or cutting the deficit. That's a powerful argument for changing the status quo.'<br/> The study on the potential for greener taxes, which pools data from 12 member states, suggests that moving taxes away from labour and towards pollution (increasing taxes on the causes of air and water pollution, for example) would bring in revenues of \u20ac35 billion in real terms in 2016, rising to \u20ac101bn in 2025, with far higher figures involved if steps were also taken to remove environmentally harmful subsidies. The potential revenues range from just over 1% of GDP per annum through to just over 2.5% of GDP per annum in 2025, depending on the member state concerned.<br/> The second study looks at various links between environment and economic policy, including the macro-economic impact of floods, best practices in supporting SMEs focusing on resource efficiency, and environmental expenditure in all member states. The approximate total cost of damage from flooding in the EU over the 2002-2013 period was at least \u20ac150bn. Investing in measures to reduce flooding is highly effective, on average costing some six to eight times less than the damage caused by flooding. Better still, the benefits of investing in green infrastructure - i.e. restoring natural features to help manage and store flood water include better outcomes for biodiversity and could help reduce construction costs.<br/> Background<br/> The studies published today will feed into the European Semester[1], a mechanism established in 2010 to improve the co-ordination of economic policies in European Union countries. It was one of the EU's responses to the financial and economic crisis, which has resulted in economic contraction and rising unemployment in many EU countries. The European Semester is based on the idea that, because EU economies are highly integrated, enhanced policy co-ordination can help boost economic development in the EU generally.<br/> By 'Greening the European Semester[2]', the Commission is aiming to ensure that macroeconomic policies are sustainable, not only economically and socially, but also environmentally. An earlier study highlighting the economic benefits of environment, which looked at implementing waste legislation to boost green growth[3], showed that full implementation would save \u20ac72bn per year, increase the annual turnover of the EU waste management and recycling sector by \u20ac42bn and create more than 400,000 jobs by 2020.<br/> More information<br/> The studies can be consulted here[4].<br/>The European Semester website[5]<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/\">http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/green_semester/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/green_semester/index_en.htm</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/study%2012%20FINAL%20REPORT.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/study%2012%20FINAL%20REPORT.pdf</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/green_semester/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/green_semester/index_en.htm</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/\">http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["The approximate total cost of damage from flooding in the EU over the 2002-2013 period was at least \u20ac150bn.

This document is the basis for upcoming discussions between the member states, the European Parliament and other stakeholders who will work on a common EU position for the global negotiations at the level of the United Nations. These talks will focus on how to mitigate the impact of natural and man-made disasters and to build a new framework for disaster risk reduction - the so-called Post 2015 Hyogo Framework for Action.</p><p><br/> What is the purpose?<br/> During recent years, disasters are increasing both in frequency and intensity and this trend is likely to continue. All countries are vulnerable: developing countries suffer a greater loss of life while developed nations bear higher economic costs. In the EU alone natural disasters have caused more than 80,000 deaths and \u20ac95 billion in economic losses during the past decade.<br/> To address these alarming trends, prevention and risk management policies are essential. A renewed post-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action is a significant opportunity to advance disaster risk management across the world.<br/> The European Commission has built the recommendations based upon the past achievements in disaster risk management of a range of EU policies including civil protection, environmental protection, internal security, climate change adaptation, health, research and innovation and external action. These achievements are an important EU contribution towards building a coherent policy on disaster risk management at European and international levels.<br/> What is the Hyogo Framework for Action?<br/> The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 'Building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters' is a ten-year plan adopted by 168 UN member states who voluntarily committed to work on five priorities for action with the objective of making the world safer from natural hazards and to build disaster resilience. Adopted in 2005, the HFA will expire in 2015. A wide consultation process is taking place on shaping the post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction.<br/> What are the key proposals of the Commission?<br/> 1. More transparency and better governance of the new post 2015 Hyogo framework for Action<br/> The European Commission suggests governance standards, periodic peer reviews and the collection and sharing of globally comparable data on disaster losses and hazards.<br/> 2. Focus on results<br/> The European Commission proposes the introduction of targets and measurable actions to reduce disaster risks.<br/> 3. Disaster risk-reduction measures should contribute to sustainable and smart growth<br/> All major infrastructure and projects should be risk-sensitive and climate-and-disaster-resilient.<br/> Innovative technologies and instruments to support disaster management should be further encouraged (early-warning systems, resilient infrastructure and buildings, green infrastructure, risk communication etc) in order to lead to increased business opportunities and contribute to green growth.<br/> 4. Special attention to the most vulnerable<br/> The Commission also expects the new Hyogo Framework for Action to be more gender-sensitive and to target vulnerable groups such as children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, the homeless and the poor. Particular attention should be paid to building resilience in all urban and vulnerable rural settings, as well as in coastal areas.<br/> Alongside natural hazards, a comprehensive international framework should also address conflict and other forms of violence and state fragility as well as technological risks, food and nutrition insecurity and epidemics.<br/> What are some of the main achievements related to disaster risk management in the EU in recent years?<br/> Prevention and risk management measures have been integrated in a number of key EU policies and financial instruments (i.e. climate change adaptation, cohesion policy, transport and energy, research and innovation, cross-border health threats, environmental impact assessment, and others); the Commission has prepared a first cross-sectoral overview of risks in the EU and launched an initiative with member states to map risks and share information about them. Multi-hazard national risk assessments are to be produced by member states by the end of 2015; data availability, accessibility, sharing and comparability has been improved, including ongoing work with Member States and international partners towards establishing European standards and protocols for recording disaster losses; ways to effectively use insurance as an incentive for risk awareness, prevention and mitigation are being explored, and; enhanced preparedness for response through the development of a voluntary pool of pre-committed disaster-response capacities, better response planning, a training network, and reinforced cooperation among authorities in the field of training and exercises, strengthened early warning systems.<br/> What is the EU doing in order to boost resilience and disaster risk reduction in developing countries?<br/> Reducing vulnerability and building the resilience of populations at risk are prerequisites for poverty reduction and sustainable development. This is why, the EU is committed to investing in these priorities. Risk management is already a part of all EU humanitarian aid and development assistance programmes - and will become an even more integral component in the future.<br/> Significant progress is already being made. Three recent EU initiatives SHARE ('Supporting the Horn of Africa's Resilience'), AGIR (the Global Alliance for Resilience in the Sahel region) and the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) are already contributing to building the resilience of some of the world's most vulnerable communities.<br/> The Disaster Preparedness programme (DIPECHO) of the European Commission funds projects based on simple preparatory measures emphasizing training, capacity-building, awareness-raising and early-warning systems of local communities around the globe. DIPECHO has proven extremely effective in limiting damage and saving lives when hazards suddenly strike.<br/> What are the next steps?<br/> The ideas presented in this Communication will be the basis of further dialogue with member states, the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and other stakeholders (civil society, academia, the private sector) as well as international partners and the UN System.<br/> The outcomes of this dialogue will feed into the preparatory process for the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (Sendai Summit) scheduled for March 2015, and the two Preparatory Committee meetings at UN level that will take place on 14-15 July and 17-18 November 2014 in Geneva.<br/> More information<br/> The European Commission's humanitarian aid and civil protection<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/index_en.htmCommissioner\">http://ec.europa.eu/echo/index_en.htmCommissioner</url> Georgieva's website<br/>Fact sheet on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/disaster_risk_reduction.pdfFact\">http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/disaster_risk_reduction.pdfFact</url> sheet on resilience<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/EU_building_resilience_en.pdfFact\">http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/EU_building_resilience_en.pdfFact</url> sheet on Disaster Risk Management[1]<br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/disaster_risk_management_en.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/disaster_risk_management_en.pdf</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["3.

The green growth model outlines a structural economic change which is mainly driven by scarcity of resources, technological change and innovation, new markets, and changes in industrial and consumer demand patterns. Prices of resources, raw materials and energy are already having an impact on the cost structure of companies[2], and global demand for those resources will continue to rise due to increasing consumption in emerging economies.<br/> The Europe 2020 Strategy[3] identifies the transition towards a green, low carbon, energy and resource-efficient economy as essential to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The EU has implemented a number of policies and strategies aimed at supporting the shift towards a resource efficient and low carbon economy, while strengthening the EU's competitiveness. One of the most significant initiatives is the 2020 Climate and Energy Package[4], which sets targets to be reached by 2020 for greenhouse gas emission reductions, renewable energy sources and improved energy efficiency. A gradual shift towards an energy and resource-efficient circular economy will increase competitiveness and boost economic growth, while creating more and better jobs in the EU. Saving, re-using and recycling materials will support the future competitiveness of successful companies (see IP/14/763[5] and MEMO/14/450[6] on the Commission Communication on the Circular Economy).<br/> Industry already recognizes the strong business case for improving resource productivity. It is estimated that resource efficiency improvements all along the value chains could reduce material input needs by 17%-24% by 2030 and a better use of resources could represent an overall savings potential of \u20ac630 billion per year for European industry.<br/> Why a Green Employment Initiative?<br/> The structural shift of our economic model towards green growth is inevitable and also predictable. It is both a challenge and an opportunity for the labour market which, in turn, is a key factor for enabling green growth. It should therefore be anticipated in order to reap the full benefits of this economic transformation for workers and employers1[7].<br/> The transition will bring about fundamental transformations across the entire economy and across a wide range of sectors: additional employment will be created,some jobs will be replaced and others redefined. Understanding the labour market implications is therefore necessary tobetter anticipate and manage structural adjustments.<br/> In this context, better targeting and coordination of labour market measures and tools - through an integrated framework - are essential to create the necessary conditions to support green employment.<br/> In which sectors will jobs be created?<br/> It is widely acknowledged that a successful transition towards a green and resource and energy efficient economy will reshape labour markets.<br/> There is significant potential for creating new jobs in the production of energy from renewable sources, energy efficiency, waste and water management, air quality, restoring and preserving biodiversity, climate change adaptation and the development of green infrastructure. The following estimates can be made:<br/><br/> Improving waste prevention and management in the EU could create more than 400[8],[9]000 new jobs[10], and the review of the waste legislation now proposed by the Commission could create an estimated further 180,000 jobs;<br/><br/> a 1% increase in the rate of growth of the water industry in Europe can create between 10[11],[12]000 and 20[13],[14]000 new jobs;[15]<br/><br/> internal transformation and redefinition of jobs will affect sectors with a high share of emissions (energy power, transport, agriculture, building which are responsible for respectively 33%, 20%, 12% and 12% of EU greenhouse gas emissions);<br/><br/> the construction sector could create 400,000 new jobs from making buildings more energy efficient to meet the requirements of the Energy Efficiency Directive[16] (see also IP/14/764[17] and MEMO/14/451[18] on new proposals to reduce the environmental impact of new and renovated buildings);<br/><br/> for energy intensive industries (e.g. chemicals, iron and steel), the picture is more complex, as they face both challenges and opportunities resulting from the need to mitigate emissions and the development of new sectors and goods. In order to address the competitiveness of the industries which are at risk of relocation due to the impact of climate policies, the Commission has put in place measures to prevent 'carbon leakage'. In the chemical sector, a greener chemical industry is estimated to create more jobs than in the petroleum industry and the current chemical industry. In the steel industry, use of recycled material, such as scrap steel, results in major energy savings and therefore has a positive impact on the competitiveness of the sector, and;<br/><br/> as for the wider economy, by increasing the efficiency of production processes, adopting innovative solutions to save resources, developing new business models, or offering more sustainable products and services, companies can expand their markets and create new jobs, while transforming existing ones. Resource productivity in the EU grew by 20% in the period 2000-2011. Maintaining this rate would lead to a further increase by 30% by 2030, and could boost GDP by nearly 1%, while creating more than 2 million jobs.<br/><br/> What integrated framework for employment policies in the transition towards a green economy?<br/> The Green Employment Initiative calls for an integrated approach by setting out policy actions to be taken at European and national levels, including: <br/><br/> Bridging existing skills gaps by fostering skills developments and better forecasting skills needs across sectors and industries;<br/><br/> anticipating change and securing transitions by assessing and developing sectoral initiatives on anticipation and managing restructuring;by supporting peer reviews on adequate labour market policies in the framework of the European Semester[19]; by working with the European Public Employment Services Networkto support occupational mobility to meet specific labour market needs in the green economy;<br/><br/> boosting job creation by making efficient use of EU funding (seebelow); by shifting taxes away from labour towards pollution as stressed in the framework of the <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific-recommendations/index_en.htmEuropean\">http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific-recommendations/index_en.htmEuropean</url> Semester; promoting green public procurement; entrepreneurship and social entreprises;<br/><br/> increasing data quality and monitoring of labour market developments by providing support to national statistical offices through financial and training support; building on the framework of employment and environment indicators developed by the EU Employment Committee[20] to support monitoring of policies in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the European Semester;<br/><br/> promoting social dialogue at cross industry and sectoral levels as a pre-requisite to facilitate the greening of the economy. As recommended by the European Resource Efficiency Platform[21] (EREP), the Commission will support workers' involvement in matters related to environmental management, energy and resource use and emerging risks at the work place, enhance workers' rights to information and consultation, and develop sector-wide resource efficiency road maps, and;<br/><br/> strengthening international cooperation by engaging in the Green Growth Knowledge Platform[22] launched in 2012 by the Global Green Growth Institute, OECD, UNEP and World Bank.<br/><br/> How does the Green Employment Initiative feed into the EU economic governance frameworka<br/> Employment and labour market policies are at the core of the European Semester[23] for coordination of economic policy. European employment policy needs to play a more active role in supporting job creation and in matching labour and skills demands related to the transition to the green and resource efficient economy. To this end, the Communication identifies the following priorities:<br/><br/> Improving integration and co-ordination of existing European and national level policies and initiatives;<br/><br/> further developing governance structures and methodological tools to facilitate the transition towards a green and resource efficient economy, to better co-ordinate policies and to ensure consistent monitoring of reform measures; and establishing a closer working relationship and dialogue with employee and employer organisations on the employment challenges for greening the economy;<br/><br/> further strengthening the existing skills intelligence tools and networks to better anticipate and monitor developments in sectors and occupations linked to green growth and a resource efficient, circular economy;<br/><br/> ensuring that EU and member states funding programmes and policies support job creation in the green economy;<br/><br/> monitoring progress related to green employment and assessing it in the context of the European Semester[24], and;<br/><br/> building on the recommendations[25] of the European Resource Efficiency Platform[26] (EREP) to develop a broad strategy for greening jobs, skills and education.<br/><br/> How is this Green Employment Initiative linked to the Communication on the Circular Economy and the Green Action Plan for SMEs?<br/> The 2013 and 2014 Annual Growth Surveys[27] stressed the job creation potential of the green economy and the need to develop strategic frameworks in which labour market and skills policies play an active role in supporting job creation. Nevertheless, integrated policy frameworks linking green growth and employment exist in only a small number of Member States (Greece, France, Austria, Portugal and Finland), with the majority having a disjointed and fragmented approach (see Draft Joint Employment Report 2013[28]). Together with the Communication on the Circular economy (see IP/14/763[29] and MEMO/14/450[30]) and the Green Action Plan for SMEs (see IP/14/766[31] and MEMO/14/452[32]), the Green Employment Initiative will contribute to developing such an integrated approach. The adoption of the three Communications aims to coordinate targeted policy responses and tools to ensure that the employment and environmental agendas converge and contribute to reaching the Europe 2020 objectives[33].<br/> What EU funding is available to implement these measures?<br/> EU funding is available to help member states with the employment opportunities and challenges of the transition to a greener economy.<br/><br/> The European Social Fund[34] (ESF) co-finances labour market activation measures, measures to smooth the transition into work and the upgrading of knowledge and skills.<br/><br/> The European Regional Development Fund[35] (ERDF) supports investments in energy and resource efficiency, renewable energy, waste and water management, green infrastructure, biodiversity conservation and protection, eco-innovation, education infrastructure and research, development and innovation in low-carbon technologies. <br/><br/> The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) supports investments in agriculture, forestry, the environment, rural business and infrastructure including investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, resource management (water, waste, land, etc.), and innovation.<br/><br/> The programme for the 'Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs[36]' (COSME) and Horizon 2020[37] aim to contribute to economic growth and employment by supporting projects dealing with innovation, including renewable energies, energy efficiency ecosystem restoration and re-naturing cities. <br/><br/> The LIFE [38]programme supports a number of targeted innovative environmental and climate-related projects with an impact on jobs and skills, including through the Natural Capital Financing Facility and the Private Finance for Energy Efficiency instruments.<br/><br/> The Commission also encourages and supports the setting-up and implementation of financial instruments co-financed by the European Structural and Investment Funds through the Financial Instruments - Technical Advisory Platform (FI-TAP) and other joint instruments with the EIB Group. These instruments can leverage additional private investment in the greening of the economy and can help realise the related jobs potential.<br/> What are the next steps for the Communication?<br/> The text will be submitted to the EU's Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions for their endorsement. The Communication is due to be discussed at the first informal Jumbo meeting of Ministers for Employment and Environment in Milan on 17 July.<br/><br/>1: OECD (2012), The jobs potential of a shift

It is widely acknowledged that a successful transition towards a green and resource and energy efficient economy will reshape labour markets. The following estimates can be made: Improving waste prevention and management in the EU could create more than 400[8],[9]000 new jobs[10], and the review of the waste legislation now proposed by the Commission could create an estimated further 180,000 jobs; a 1% increase in the rate of growth of the water industry in Europe can create between 10[11],[12]000 and 20[13],[14]000 new jobs;[15] internal transformation and redefinition of jobs will affect sectors with a high share of emissions (energy power, transport, agriculture, building which are responsible for respectively 33%, 20%, 12% and 12% of EU greenhouse gas emissions); the construction sector could create 400,000 new jobs from making buildings more energy efficient to meet the requirements of the Energy Efficiency Directive[16] (see also IP/14/764[17] and MEMO/14/451[18] on new proposals to reduce the environmental impact of new and renovated buildings); for energy intensive industries (e. g.", "EU funding is available to help member states with the employment opportunities and challenges of the transition to a greener economy. The European Social Fund[34] (ESF) co-finances labour market activation measures, measures to smooth the transition into work and the upgrading of knowledge and skills.
