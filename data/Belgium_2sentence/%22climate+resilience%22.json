We offer a wide range of renewable and recyclable wood fibre-based solutions to EU citizens, from packaging to textile, including hygiene and tissue products, and our raw material comes mainly from European sustainably-managed forests. As an important milestone will be marked this year with the UN climate negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow and at the biodiversity conference in October in Kunming (China), as they include climate and biodiversity protection as strong components of political debates in reaching the UN SDGs, our industry recalls that biodiversity protection is an integral component of sustainable forest management (SFM). Carina Hkansson, CEO of the Swedish Forests Industries Federation (SFIF), speaking on behalf of the Confederation of European Paper Industries (Cepi) welcomed the launch of the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE): #8216;Forest-related information has to be science-based and undisputed to provide the basis for future policies supporting forests and the forest sector deliver their contribution to the Green Deal.#8217; The protection of biodiversity is not only extremely important in itself, but also a part of our efforts to reach the EU 2050 carbon neutrality goal. In light of the current debate on the best way to protect the biodiversity in forests, the European paper industry believes that the evaluation of the implementation of the current Biodiversity Strategy should be known before setting goals for a 2030 biodiversity strategy. In this way all relevant actors can contribute to the discussion and highlight what solutions are currently working in the best way. </p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 8, "title": "Commission funds 171 new LIFE projects in environment and climate across Europe with over \u20ac396 million", "published": "2023-11-16", "bodyText": "<p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

While the EU does everything within its power to mitigate climate change, domestically and internationally, we must also get ready to face its unavoidable consequences. From deadly heatwaves and devastating droughts, to decimated forests and coastlines eroded by rising sea levels, climate change is already taking its toll in Europe and worldwide. </p><p>Building on the 2013 Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, the aim of today's proposals is to shift the focus from understanding the problem to developing solutions, and to move from planning to implementation.European Green Deal Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans said: 'The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark reminder that insufficient preparation can have dire consequences. There is no vaccine against the climate crisis, but we can still fight it and prepare for its unavoidable effects. The impacts of climate change are already felt both inside and outside the European Union. The new climate adaptation strategy equips us to speed up and deepen preparations. If we get ready today, we can still build a climate-resilient tomorrow.'Economic losses from more frequent climate-related extreme weather are increasing. In the EU, these losses alone already average over  12 billion per year. Conservative estimates show that exposing today's EU economy to global warming of 3C above pre-industrial levels would result in an annual loss of at least  170 billion. Climate change affects not only the economy, but also the health and well-being of Europeans, who increasingly suffer from heat waves; the deadliest natural disaster of 2019 worldwide was the European heatwave, with 2500 deaths.Our action on climate change adaptation must involve all parts of society and all levels of governance, inside and outside the EU. We will work to build a climate resilient society by improving knowledge of climate impacts and adaptation solutions; by stepping up adaptation planning and climate risk assessments; by accelerating adaptation action; and by helping to strengthen climate resilience globally.Smarter, swifter, and more systemic adaptationAdaptation actions must be informed by robust data and risk assessment tools that are available to all - from families buying, building and renovating homes to businesses in coastal regions or farmers planning their crops. To achieve this, the strategy proposes actions that push the frontiers of knowledge on adaptation so that we can gather more and better data on climate-related risks and losses, making them available to all. Climate-ADAPT[1], the European platform for adaptation knowledge, will be enhanced and expanded, and a dedicated health observatory will be added to better track, analyse and prevent health impacts of climate change.Climate change has impacts at all levels of society and across all sectors of the economy, so adaptation actions must be systemic. The Commission will continue to incorporate climate resilience considerations in all relevant policy fields. It will support the further development and implementation of adaptation strategies and plans with three cross cutting priorities: integrating adaptation into macro-fiscal policy, nature-based solutions for adaptation, and local adaptation action.Stepping up international actionOur climate change adaptation policies must match our global leadership in climate change mitigation. The Paris Agreement established a global goal on adaptation and highlighted adaptation as a key contributor to sustainable development. The EU will promote sub-national, national and regional approaches to adaptation, with a specific focus on adaptation in Africa and Small Island Developing States. We will increase support for international climate resilience and preparedness through the provision of resources, by prioritizing action and increasing effectiveness, through the scaling up of international finance and through stronger global engagement and exchanges on adaptation. We will also work with international partners to close the gap in international climate finance.BackgroundClimate change is happening today, so we have to build a more resilient tomorrow. The world has just concluded the hottest decade on record during which the title for the hottest year was beaten eight times. The frequency and severity of climate and weather extremes is increasing. These extremes range from unprecedented forest fires and heatwaves right above the Arctic Circle to devastating droughts in the Mediterranean region, and from hurricanes ravaging EU outermost regions to forests decimated by unprecedented bark beetle outbreaks in Central and Eastern Europe. Slow onset events, such as desertification, loss of biodiversity, land and ecosystem degradation, ocean acidification or sea level rise are equally destructive over the long term.The European Commission announced this new, more ambitious EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Communication on the European Green Deal[2], following a 2018 evaluation of the 2013 Strategy[3] and an open public consultation[4] between May and August 2020. The European Climate Law proposal[5] provides the foundation for increased ambition and policy coherence on adaptation. It integrates the global goal on adaptation in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goal 13 action into EU law. The proposal commits the EU and Member States to make continuous progress to boost adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. The new adaptation strategy will help make this progress a reality.More information2021 EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change[6]Questions and Answers[7]Adaptation to climate change website[8]European Green Deal[9]Video stockshots on adaptation to climate change[10] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu\">https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:738:FIN\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:738:FIN</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/commission-launches-online-public-consultation-new-eu-strategy-adaptation-climate-change_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/commission-launches-online-public-consultation-new-eu-strategy-adaptation-climate-change_en</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1588581905912&amp;#38;uri=CELEX:52020PC0080\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1588581905912&amp;#38;uri=CELEX:52020PC0080</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/adaptation/what/docs/eu_strategy_2021.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/adaptation/what/docs/eu_strategy_2021.pdf</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_664\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_664</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu\">https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu</url>/ [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-193268\">https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-193268</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["Climate change affects not only the economy, but also the health and well-being of Europeans, who increasingly suffer from heat waves; the deadliest natural disaster of 2019 worldwide was the European heatwave, with 2500 deaths.

Some results of the collaboration between Berlin and San Pedro de la Paz (Chile) Redesigning urban spaces, promoting greater use of renewable resources or reshaping our industries are some of the conclusions of this project, which has brought together more than 30 cities in Europe and Latin America with the aim of rethinking their cities in the face of this unprecedented scenario. IUC-LAC Open Dialogues looks to capitalize on the added value created by international urban cooperation between European cities that were heavily impacted by the pandemic, and those in Latin America and the Caribbean, which are currently at the peak of the pandemic. </p><p>Tourism, public space, mobility and transport, green and smart economy and climate resilience are some of the issues addressed by this publication. According to Sandra Marn, head of the publication and City to city cooperation Coordinator of the IUC-LAC Programme, the aim of the publication 'is to serve as an inspiration for governments to rethink their cities from innovative and people-centred perspectives'. Some of the voices included in this publication are mayors, technicians, companies, networks, associations and representatives of the European Union who are bringing their particular expertise to this publication. European cities such as Madrid, Rome, Turin, Porto and Zagreb share their points of view with Latin American cities such as Cartagena, Buenos Aires, Rosario, Arequipa and Barranquilla, among others. Good practices in cities One of the best practices in terms of public space is the City Card service in Genoa (Italy), one of the cities participating in the publication. This service is a new tool that calculates the spatial and temporal distribution of visitors in tourist attractions and allows the reorganization of services, guaranteeing that the safety distance is met. With regard to mobility and transport, the case of Turin (Italy) stands out. This city has launched a pilot project for the use of hybrid cars with geofencing, a system with an algorithm that allows them to change their engine to electric when they enter the city centre. The one in Turin is the first pilot using this technology in the world. In terms of the green economy, the case of Pavlos Melas (Greece) is remarkable. They are boosting their economic recovery by giving priority to environmental recovery, investing in drinking water, clean air or clean energy, and organizing their investment on the basis of spatial justice criteria, whereby the most vulnerable communities receive more financial support. Concerning climate resilience, the publication reviews the case of the municipality of Almada (Portugal), which works as a 'global player', since, according to the Head of the Department of Innovation and the Environment, Catarina Freitas, 'it is necessary to review the financing framework in order to meet global demands while carrying out local management'. The publication, developed by the Latin America and Caribbean regional delegation, is part of the International Urban Cooperation programme (IUC), led by the European Union's Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) and the Foreign Policy Instrument (FPI). Throughout the IUC programme, 165 cities from 23 EU member states and 11 other countries from all regions of the world have participated. The publication examines this new pandemic, a unique moment in history for cities, from an optimistic perspective. In fact, according to Vilnius (Lithuania) Urban Development Director, Ruta Matoniene, 'it is a time to learn and reinvent ourselves, for new plans, designs and ideas'. Ver\u00f3nica Ramrez, from the Smart City Cluster in Spain, comments that 'municipalities did not respond to the need for digital transformation before, and now this need is being used to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic'. About IUC The International Urban Cooperation Programme (IUC), funded by the European Union, supports cities in different regions of the world to connect and share solutions for common problems in sustainable urban development in the framework of the New Urban Agenda and the fight against Climate Change.

NGOs call to quickly redress the balance and create an EU-wide ban on bottom trawling in marine protected areas to really protect Europe's most valuable and threatened ocean biodiversity and species. </p><p><br/>EU countries have been in a race to designate new areas at the expense of putting in place proper management measures. Over the last 20 years, while the total marine protected area surface in Europe has multiplied by six, still 57% of Atlantic habitats and 75% and 40% of Baltic and Mediterranean species remain in bad conservation status 1. Destructive fishing is prevalent inside the Natura 2000 network 2, with several million hours recorded annually 3. <br/>Vera Coelho, senior director of advocacy at Oceana in Europe, said: 'As we celebrate 30 years of a pioneering piece of EU nature legislation, let's not be misled by percentages but be honest about the reality: marine protection in Europe is mostly meaningless. Most marine Natura 2000 sites are merely lines on a map that still allow the most harmful fishing methods, like bottom trawling, to go on inside them. It is questionable as to why they're called Marine Protected Areas given their lack of actual protection.' <br/>Seas At Risk Marine Policy Officer Marc-Philip Buckhout said: '30 years after the establishment of the Natura 2000 network, bottom trawling still occurs in 86% of the area designated to protect bottom habitats, hampering conservation and recovery. Banning bottom trawling from marine protected areas, would help reverse biodiversity loss and contribute to climate change mitigation by the ocean, with net socio-economic benefits.' <br/>NGOs are calling for EU countries to ban the most destructive forms of fishing in all existing marine protected areas (MPAs) and to focus on creating new strictly protected areas in order to reach the 10% EU target (from less than 0.1% currently). Strictly protected MPAs, which are no-take zones excluding all extractive and destructive activities, are our best allies to rapidly and effectively rebuild marine biodiversity and climate resilience of the ocean. <br/>Paradoxically, the Natura 2000 legislation contains strict provisions to evaluate and restrict activities detrimental to the ecological objectives of MPAs, with for instance, a 'non-deterioration' rule to prevent damage from any ongoing activities in the site that applies from day one of designation. <br/>For years, though, implementation of the legislation by EU countries has been poor and inconsistent 4, as they have often exempted fishing activities from any environmental impact assessment inside MPAs. The European Commission has also closed its eyes too long, allowing EU countries to breach the law, to the point of accepting low standards of protection for Natura 2000. <br/>EU Commissioner Sinkevi\u010dius and Executive Vice President Timmermans have an opportunity to act decisively, on behalf of the European Commission, to ban bottom trawling in all EU MPAs in the upcoming EU Action Plan on the oceans and in the upcoming Nature Restoration Law expected this Spring 2022. Without this ban, the ocean targets from the 2030 Biodiversity Strategy cannot be achieved. <br/>Background <br/>Recent data shows that most protected habitats and species in marine Natura 2000 sites are in poor conservation status in all EU regions. Further, the conservation status of many habitats and species is unknown due to lack of data from EU countries. <br/>Conservation status of marine species and habitats by EU region (EEA State of Nature 2020) <br/>Natura 2000 is the largest network of protected areas in the world, both on land and at sea, offering resting and breeding grounds for Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats. It covers 11.1% of EU seas, of which only 0.1% is strictly protected from any damaging activities. <br/>The EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy set targets to protect at least 30% of EU seas, with 10% strictly protected. To achieve the 30%, at EU level, it means almost tripling the area currently protected under Natura 2000 by an additional 18.9%.  <br/>A recent analysis[1] by Oceana revealed the permissiveness of EU Member States vis-  vis threats from human activities in Natura 2000 areas: 70% of the 3449 marine sites assessed were affected by at least one major threat (e.g. maritime traffic, fishing, submarine pipelines and cables, anchorage areas, aquaculture farms, dredging, offshore oil and gas installations).

The funding will support new major environmental and climate projects in 11 EU countries - Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Slovenia. The projects contribute to a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic[2] and support the European Green Deal's[3] objectives of making the EU climate neutral and zero-pollution by 2050. They are examples of actions to deliver key European Green Deal objectives under the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030[4] and the EU Circular Economy Action Plan[5]. </p><p><br/>European Green Deal Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans said: 'We have no time to waste when it comes to the climate, biodiversity and pollution crises. The LIFE programme provides direct support to projects across the EU and enables entire countries and regions to protect and restore nature. Nature is our biggest ally and we need to take care of it so it can take care of us. My congratulations to each of the projects selected today.' <br/>Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius added: 'LIFE Programme integrated projects is one of the main tools to make the green transition a reality by delivering targeted changes on the ground. Through these projects, Member States can green their economies, bring back nature and biodiversity, and improve their resilience. I am looking forward to seeing the benefits that this investment will bring in the 11 countries and beyond their borders.' <br/>Integrated projects allow Member States to pool additional EU funding sources, including agricultural, structural, regional and research funds, as well as national funding and private sector investment. Altogether, the 11 projects are expected to attract more than \u20ac10 billion of complementary funds, significantly multiplying the resources allocated today to make a real difference on the ground. <br/>Delivering Green Deal objectives on the ground <br/>Nature conservation: A project in France will introduce measures to halt and reverse biodiversity decline in the Grand Est region by, for instance, setting up three pilot forest areas. Another project will mitigate the adverse effects of human activities that threaten Finland's marine and coastal biodiversity, by monitoring and improving the management of the national network of Marine Protected Areas. These projects will help deliver the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030[6]. <br/>Clean air: A project in Poland will implement measures to improve overall air quality in the region of Silesia where air pollution is among the most severe in Europe, by replacing small-scale solid-fuel domestic heating devices with less polluting alternatives. This project contributes to the EU's 2030 greenhouse gas emission targets[7] and the Zero Pollution Action Plan[8]. <br/>Waste management: In Cyprus, a project will aim to improve the infrastructure and collection systems for recyclable and biodegradable waste. In Latvia, the focus will be on improving separate waste collection and reuse of municipal waste. In Denmark, a project will work on waste prevention and on setting up a better waste regulatory framework. The project in Slovenia will aim to achieve a better recycling rate of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste, among other actions. In total, four projects will focus on waste prevention and recovering resources, contributing to the goals of the EU's Circular Economy Action Plan[9] and the Waste Framework Directive[10]. <br/>Climate change mitigation: LIFE funding will help Lithuania reach the objectives set out in its national energy and climate plan (NECP) including more efficient buildings, climate-friendly mobility, an energy-saving industry, and enhanced green public procurement. In Estonia, various tools and solutions will be created for the deep renovations on a range of buildings in three cities, which can then be replicated across Estonia and other member states and support the EU's Renovation Wave Strategy[11]. <br/>Climate change adaptation: In the Netherlands, LIFE funding will help stimulate climate change adaptation across several sectors: water management, infrastructure, agriculture, nature, health and spatial/urban planning. A project in the Moravian-Silesian Region in Czechia will increase the region's climate resilience, improve the quality of the environment for inhabitants and support sustainable development. Both projects will be following the goals of the EU's Adaptation Strategy.[12] <br/>Find out more about the 11 integrated projects in the short descriptions[13]. <br/>Background <br/>The LIFE programme[14] is the EU's funding instrument for the environment and climate action. It has been running since 1992 and has co-financed more than 5 500 projects across the EU and beyond. The Commission has increased LIFE programme funding by almost 60% for the 2021-2027 period. It now stands at \u20ac5.4 billion. LIFE has currently four sub-programmes: nature and biodiversity, circular economy and quality of life, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and clean energy transition. <br/>The LIFE programme provides funding for integrated projects. These projects support the implementation of EU environmental and climate legislation and policies, on regional, multi-regional, national or trans-national level. Integrated projects help Member States comply with key EU legislation in six areas: nature conservation, water, air, waste management, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. <br/>More information <br/>Annex[15] - project descriptions <br/>LIFE programme[16] <br/>LIFE integrated projects[17] <br/>Photo and video stockshots on Biodiversity[18] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/life_en\">https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/life_en</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/recovery-plan-europe_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/recovery-plan-europe_en</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_884\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_884</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_420\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_420</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_884\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_884</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-framework-directive_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-framework-directive_en</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/renovation-wave_en\">https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/renovation-wave_en</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_22_865\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_22_865</url> [ 14]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/life_en\">https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/life_en</url> [ 15]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_22_865\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_22_865</url> [ 16]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/life_en\">https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/life_en</url> [ 17]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/life/projects/ip.htm\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/life/projects/ip.htm</url> [ 18]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/topnews/M-005972\">https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/topnews/M-005972</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

These aim at increasing trade, strengthening connectivity and deepening economic integration with Armenia[2],Azerbaijan[3],Belarus[4],Georgia[5], theRepublic of Moldova[6]andUkraine[7], strengthening democratic institutions, the rule of law, environmental and climate resilience, supporting the digital transformation, and promoting fair and inclusive societies. High Representative/Vice-President JosepBorrellsaid: 'Our neighbours' strength is also the European Union's strength; the Eastern Partnership remains a crucial element of the EU's foreign policy. </p><p>Our proposals will further strengthen our six partner countries, reflecting the priorities and challenges that we share, while maintaining the emphasis on delivering tangible, positive results for all citizens.' Neighbourhood and Enlargement Commissioner Olivr Vrhelyi said: 'We are sending a very clear message to our Eastern partner countries: we will help you to build strong economies and to create growth and jobs by attracting foreign direct investment and by strengthening connectivity in key sectors, such as transport, energy and environment. We will work closely together to address today's challenges across the board, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.' Building on the achievements of the Partnership in the first 10 years, today's proposal outlines how the EU will work together with the partner countries to tackle common challenges and strengthen their resilience in the light of today's challenges as an overriding policy objective beyond 2020. In doing so, work between the EU and partners will continue on new policy priorities to support the ecological transformation, the digital transformation and to deliver on economies that work for all, in particular more job opportunities for youth and to promote gender equality. Together, the EU and its Eastern Partners will create a partnership that creates, protects, greens, connects and empowers. The proposal is expected to be endorsed in view of the Eastern Partnership Summit in June 2020, which will give a mandate to develop a new set of tangible deliverables building on the current 20 Deliverables for 2020[8].

This is an important step towards disbursing \u20ac17.8 billion in grants and \u20ac12.7bn in loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) over the period 2021-2026. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Greece's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Greece emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF - at the heart of NextGenerationEU - will provide up to \u20ac672.5bn (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU.  </p><p><br/><br/>An Economy that Works for People Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said: 'Greece's recovery plan will help it emerge stronger from the pandemic and equip the economy for a greener and more digital future. The measures include support for energy efficient renovations and clean urban transport, as well as a focus on improving the population's digital skills, both in terms of education and in terms of reskilling and upskilling the workforce. We welcome Greece's ambition to invigorate private investment and reform labour market policies, digitalise the public administration and businesses, all of which will be key for the modernisation of the Greek economy. Taken together, the plan provides a unique opportunity for Greece to equip its economy and people for the future and put the country on a more sustainable growth path. We stand ready to support the Greek authorities to fully implement these reforms and investments.' <br/><br/>The Greek plan forms part of an unprecedented co-ordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Greece's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, whether the investments and reforms set out in Greece's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience.  <br/><br/>Securing Greece's green and digital transitions  <br/><br/>The Commission's assessment of the plan finds that it devotes 38% of Greece's total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes investments in upgrading the electricity network, strengthening the support scheme for producers of renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the plan supports investments in energy efficient renovations and the development of local urban plans with a focus on strengthening climate resilience of urban areas. Other measures include support for a national reforestation programme and a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the civil protection and disaster management systems that covers, amongst others, investment in flood mitigation. The Commission's assessment of the plan finds that it devotes 23% of Greece's total allocation to the digital transition.  <br/><br/>This is in excess of the minimum of 20% required by the RRF Regulation. Measures to support Greece's digital transition include investments in digital infrastructure such 5G and fibre networks, measures to support the digital transition of the public administration and investments and reforms to support the digitalisation of businesses with a particular focus on small and medium sized enterprises. The plan also includes measures to improve digital skills at all levels, as part of the education system and through dedicated trainings for all age groups. Reinforcing Greece's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Greece's plan effectively addresses all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Greece by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures that contribute to economic growth and increase employment through improving productivity. <br/><br/>Commission President President Ursula von der Leyen said: 'I am delighted to present the European Commission's positive assessment of Greece's \u20ac30.5 billion recovery and resilience plan. The plan is ambitious and will help build a better future for the Greek people. It can reshape Greece for decades ahead. We need to make the best out of it, for the next generations. We will stand with you every step of the way.' <br/><br/>The plan provides for the implementation of a comprehensive national public health programme that will support primary, secondary and tertiary prevention and strengthen primary care, making the economy more open, improving public administration and making the judicial system more efficient. Alongside the substantial increase in public investment, the Plan makes full use of the Recovery and Resilience Facility loans to provide funding to companies and increase the level of private investment. The Plan builds on and complements key ongoing structural reforms to improve the broader functioning of the economy and which are currently monitored under the enhanced surveillance framework. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Greece's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation. <br/><br/>Supporting flagship investment and reform projects  <br/><br/>The Greek plan proposes projects in all seven European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects which address issues that are common to all member states in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the twin transition. For instance, Greece has proposed \u20ac2.3bn to reform the education, training and life-long learning system combined with investments in upskilling and reskilling programmes that cover the entire labour force. These measures aim to equip people with high quality and labour market relevant skills, including skills related to the green and digital transitions. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation.  <br/><br/>The controls systems put in place by Greece are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds.  <br/><br/>Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said: 'Forty years since Greece joined the Community we are opening a new chapter in the country's long European story. Greece stands to benefit from more than \u20ac30bn in support through NextGenerationEU, financing that will underpin major investments and far-reaching reforms over the next five years. This is an ambitious plan that stands to benefit every part of Greece and every segment of Greek society. Greece has come a long way since the last crisis and so has the European Union: NextGenerationEU is a partnership that will we will take forward together.'  <br/><br/>Next steps  <br/><br/>The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide \u20ac17.8bn in grants and \u20ac12.7bn in loans to Greece under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of \u20ac4bn to Greece in prefinancing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Greece. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms. <br/></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["Securing Greece's green and digital transitions  The Commission's assessment of the plan finds that it devotes 38% of Greece's total allocation to measures that support climate objectives.

Oceana welcomes this call for action and urges all governments to agree on ambitious post-2020 targets that protect oceans effectively, restore natural marine ecosystems and integrate strong climate resilience. For Oceana, 2020 as the 'Super Year[1]' for nature, is equally critical for our oceans. </p><p>The latest assessment by theIntergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES[2]) found that two-thirds of marine environments have been 'severely altered' by human activity, with overfishing the biggest cause of marine biodiversity loss over the last 40 years. A third of all marine mammals, sharks and coral reefs are threatened with extinction, while overfishing, pollution and climate change are fuelling nature's decline at rates unprecedentedin human history. 'The climate and biodiversity emergency require transformative change to avoid critical consequences for humanity, including the collapse of food and health systems,' said Oceana in Europe Executive Director Pascale Moehrle. 'We call on the European Union to take responsibility by adopting an ambitious EU Biodiversity Strategy that sets binding targets to restore oceans by 2030 and lead the way internationally at COP15 to reach a Paris-style agreement for nature.' On marine protection, the EU journey to reach 10% of marine protected areas (MPAs) was a long path full of pitfalls, let alone efforts to achieve less than 1% of strictly protected areas. The prevalence of marine 'paper parks' illustrates the lack of political will to deliver: 85% of the current network of MPAs does not have any management in place and so delivers no benefits to the marine life that sites are intended to protect. Oceana urges the European Commission to step up its efforts with binding targets for the 2030 Biodiversity Strategy as follows: A target of 30% of MPAs: strong protection of at least 30% of our ocean is needed to safeguard the global ocean on which we all depend. This 3030 target must commit to at least 30% of Highly Protected Marine Areas (with no extractive activities) such as marine reserves and no-take zones. A recent study estimated that between 26% and 41% of the world's oceans needs to be protected to effectively look after the species dependent on them. A focus on Fish Stock Recovery Areas:fisheries closures can protect effectively important habitats for fish (e.g. feeding, nursery grounds) and help rebuild fish stocks. These management tools, which have been ignored for too long, must be promoted as win-win solutions for nature and fishermen. No net loss of blue carbon habitats by 2022 and a restoration target:Given the climate and ecological emergency, a priority aim should be to protect and restore all so-called 'blue carbon' habitats (e.g. kelp forests, seagrass meadows) that play a critical role in sequestering carbon and so helping to fight against climate change, as well as protecting our coasts and providing habitats to other marine species. The future EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy will be critical for setting ambitious targets for marine conservation under the EU Green Deal and guiding action across the Union accordingly. Only by setting these targets and following up with strong implementation can we achieve critical change needed to save our oceans and build the resilience of ecosystems in the context of the climate crisis.

She is also a VP of the NAACPCA-Hawaii State Conference. <br/> Minister Paulette believes that God has called her to a life of service, which began with four years in the United States Air Force, through several years as a school bus driver with the Torrance Unified School district and has continued until this day as an associate minister at Greater Faith MBC, as an advocate for social justice and reform and finally as part of her activities at the helm of the Compton NAACP. <br/>Paulette Simpson-Gipson (Facebook) <br/>Speaking of NAACP activities, Paulette has created Court Watch, where she randomly takes a few NAACP members to court to observe cases to ensure African Americans are treated fairly. This gives Paulette and Co. firsthand knowledge of how judges are (or are not) performing their duties, which in turn will determine if the Compton NAACP supports or opposes the judge during re-election. It is no secret that the Compton NAACP is in the house because Paulette takes three business cards, one for the judge, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney. <br/> There are a lot of positive things going on with the Compton NAACP right now. On Sunday, November 21, 2021, they had their '1st Soul Food Sunday with the Compton NAACP,' from 10 am - noon, where they had sit down hot meals with the community, and then afterwards served the homeless around the city. The activities also included wellness checks, as well as assistance with completing rental and utility assistance applications. They also had adult membership drives and free memberships for children. The Compton NAACP also is in the process of beginning a youth entrepreneurship program. <br/> According to Paulette, prior to her becoming President of the Compton NAACP, the branch had not been in compliance with the National NAACP standards in 15 years; however, they have now been in compliance each year of her tenure as President. The Compton NAACP has won the Dr. Claude Hudson Award, which is given to small NAACP branches who excel, and Paulette has won the Lulann Sapp McGriff Award, which is the California State award given to a President. The Compton NAACP was chosen as the branch to launch the Climate Resilience Program in 2019. In addition to her usual NAACP related undertakings, Paulette has written opinion pieces on the importance of voting and works tirelessly to get Compton residents to vote. Although Paulette is a native of Los Angeles, she has lived in Compton for 26 years, is permanently planted, loves her community and is a staunch defender of it.

The Commission aims to at leastdouble renovation rates in the next ten years and make sure renovations lead to higher energy and resource efficiency. This will enhance the quality of life for people living in and using the buildings, reduce Europe's greenhouse gas emissions, foster digitalisation and improve the reuse and recycling of materials. By 2030,35 million buildingscould be renovated and up to 160,000 additional green jobs createdin the construction sector.Buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's energy consumption, and 36% of greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>But only 1% of buildings undergo energy efficient renovation every year, so effective action iscrucial to making Europe climate-neutral by 2050. With nearly 34 million Europeans unable to afford keeping their homes heated, public policies to promote energy efficient renovation are alsoa response to energy poverty, support the health and wellbeing of people and help reduce their energy bills. The Commission has also published today a Recommendation for member states on tackling energy poverty. European Green Deal Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermanssaid:'We want everyone in Europe to have a home they can light, heat, or cool without breaking the bank or breaking the planet. The Renovation Wave will improve the places where we work, live and study, while reducing our impact on the environment and providing jobs for thousands of Europeans. We need better buildings if we want to build back better.' Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said:'The green recovery starts at home. With the Renovation Wave we will tackle the many barriers that today make renovation complex, expensive and time consuming, holding back much needed action. We will propose better ways to measure renovation benefits, minimum energy performance standards, more EU funding and technical assistance encourage green mortgages and support more renewables in heating and cooling. This will be a game changer for home-owners, tenants and public authorities.' The strategy will prioritize action in three areas: decarbonization of heating and cooling; tackling energy poverty and worst-performing buildings; and renovation of public buildings such as schools, hospitals and administrative buildings. The Commission proposes to break down existing barriers throughout the renovation chain - from the conception of a project to its funding and completion - with a set of policy measures, funding tools and technical assistance instruments. The strategy will include the following lead actions: Strongerregulations,standards andinformation on the energy performance of buildings to set better incentives for public and private sector renovations, including a phased introduction of mandatory minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings, updated rules for Energy Performance Certificates, and a possible extension of building renovation requirements for the public sector; ensuring accessible and well-targeted funding, including through the 'Renovate' and 'Power Up' Flagships in the Recovery and Resilience Facilityunder NextGenerationEU, simplified rules for combining different funding streams, and multiple incentives for private financing; increasing capacityto prepare and implement renovation projects, from technical assistance to national and local authorities through to training and skills development for workers innew green jobs; expanding the market for sustainable construction products and services, including the integration of new materials and nature-based solutions, and revised legislation on marketing of construction products and material reuse and recovery targets; creating a New European Bauhaus, an interdisciplinary project co-steered by an advisory board of external experts including scientists, architects, designers, artists, planners and civil society. From now until summer 2021 the Commission will conduct a broad participatory co-creation process, and will thenset up of a network of five founding Bauhausin 2022 in different EU countries, and; developing neighbourhood-based approachesfor local communities to integrate renewable and digital solutions and create zero-energy districts, where consumers become prosumers selling energy to the grid. The strategy also includes anAffordable Housing Initiativefor 100 districts. The review of the Renewable Energy Directive in June 2021 will consider strengthening the renewable heating and cooling target and introducing a minimum renewable energy level in buildings. The Commission will also examine how the EU budget resources alongside the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) revenues could be used to fund national energy efficiency and savings schemes targeting lower income populations. The Ecodesign Framework will be further developed to provide efficient products for use in buildings and promote their use. The Renovation Wave is not only about making the existing buildings more energy efficient and climate neutral. It can trigger a large-scale transformation of our cities and built environment. It can be an opportunity to start a forward-looking process to match sustainability with style. As announced by President von der Leyen, the Commission will launch the New European Bauhaus to nurture a new European aesthetic that combines performance with inventiveness. We want to make liveable environments accessible to everyone, and again marry the affordable with the artistic, in a newly sustainable future. Background The COVID-19 crisis has turned the spotlight on our buildings, their importance in our daily lives and their fragilities. Throughout the pandemic, the home has been the focal point of daily life for millions of Europeans: an office for those teleworking, a make-shift nursery or classroom for children and pupils, for many a hub for online shopping or entertainment. Investing in buildings can inject a much-needed stimulus into the construction sector and the macro-economy. Renovation works are labour-intensive, create jobs and investments rooted in often local supply chains, generate demand for highly energy-efficient equipment, increase climate resilience and bring long-term value to properties. To achieve the at least 55% emissions reduction target for 2030, proposed by the Commission in September 2020, the EU must reduce buildings' greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, their energy consumption by 14%, and the energy consumption of heating and cooling by 18%. European policy and funding has already had a positive impact on the energy efficiency of new buildings, which now consume only half the energy of those built over 20 years ago. However, 85% of buildings in the EU were built over 20 years ago, and 85-95% are expected to still be standing in 2050. The Renovation Wave is needed to bring them up to similar standards.

Cities are huge contributors to climate change, responsible for about 70 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions and yet they are also at the frontline of the impacts of floods, extreme heat and drought. Research by scientists at the Crowther Lab predicted that 77 per cent of cities around the world will experience dramatic change in climate conditions over the next 30 years. </p><p>For us, the most effective response begins by helping cities embrace the essential role they play. Cities are a critical player in effective climate action, and many are already making headway where others are falling behind. Cities around the world are proving to be great beacons of ingenuity and innovation when it comes to tackling climate challenges. Their intersecting systems, concentrations of progressive thinking - and the stark reality of the possible future we face in our urban areas - mean that cities can often move faster than other parts of society. City leaders and mayors are arguably becoming more important and impactful than national governments in their drive for meaningful climate action. City mayors have been setting ambitious targets for phasing out all emissions and actively seeking out ways to reach decarbonisation more quickly than their state-level leaders. Mayors in London and Birmingham, the UK's two biggest cities, have recently urged the UK Government to devolve more responsibility for local environmental issues. Yet, the past 20 years have demonstrated that cities need more help to fully embrace the leading role they must play. While we have assembled a wide array of tools, resources and expertise, we have yet to provide cities with the kind of support to experiment, learn and take bolder steps to tackle this most serious of global issues. In Milan,EIT Climate-KICand our partners are working on a city-wide experiment to demonstrate how a city can achieve climate resilience through a ten-year strategy based on innovation and learning. Milan has a portfolio of initiatives in the process of being implemented. However, these initiatives do not add up to the scale of action needed. Together, we are building on these to create a new strategy, which includes figuring out how to plant 3 million trees across the city; using emerging technologies to combat urban heat island effects; and the launching of a \u20ac500 million fund for several climate projects, including the retrofit of 17,000 buildings to make them more sustainable. A new affordable housing development in Milan is also being built with waste reduction, carbon savings and renewable energy use at its heart. It has also used resident engagement to increase urban mobility and reduce car use. With such a short time in which to act on the climate crisis, mayors can no longer rely on traditional approaches. Long consultations, sector-by-sector planning, top down decision-making, long public procurement exercises and traditional financing models will not cut it. Instead, city leaders are looking for something faster and potentially more transformative. Citizen engagement models, new forms of empowerment and decision-making, multiple types of action happening simultaneously - across policy, finance, regulation and technology - can lead to successful city-level transformation, where states have failed. This is why, for the first time,EIT Climate-KICis calling for cities around the world to engage in climate action through the 'Climathon Global Awards.' These awards will recognise the leaders of climate innovation and ingenuity in cities. Winning cities will receive seed funding, fast track coaching and support from global experts in their fields, as well as an opportunity to connect and exchange with EIT Climate-KIC's network of 'Healthy, Clean Cities Deep Demonstration.' Taking a systemic approach, working across siloes and boundaries, involving people from the ground up and learning from unusual actors: these are just some of the ways in which we can support cities to rise to the scale of the challenge presented by climate change. The message is that it is only by working together, as a movement, that cities can build on existing progress and create the conditions for transformation and climate resilience. </p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["Yet, the past 20 years have demonstrated that cities need more help to fully embrace the leading role they must play.

The EU funding will spur additional investments leading to a total of \u20ac398.6m to be invested into 144 new projects in 23 member states[1].The support comes from the LIFE programme for the Environment and Climate Action. \u20ac323.5m will go to projects in the field of environment and resource efficiency, nature and biodiversity and environmental governance and information. </p><p>Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Commissioner Karmenu Vella said: 'I am delighted to see that this year again our LIFE programme will support many innovative projects to address our common environmental challenges. LIFE-funded projects use relatively little funding and with simple ideas to create profitable green businesses that deliver on the transition to a low-carbon and circular economy.' Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete said: 'With the Paris Agreement entering into force in a matter of weeks, we must now focus on delivering on our promises.

In this way they support the EU's implementation of the Paris Agreement.' The projects illustrate the Commission's ongoing commitment to its flagship circular economy package. A significant number of awards are granted to help member states best make the transition to a more circular economy. Examples of recognized projects in 2016 include the new energy-saving hydrogen-electric garbage trucks in Belgium, technologies for reducing the health risks of sludge in wastewater pioneered in Italy and a project to help Greek municipalities, such as Olympia, increase recycling rates.

Selected projects support the EU's target to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40\u00a0% by 2030, contributing to the shift towards a low carbon and climate resilient economy. Some examples of 2015 projects include restoration and carbon storage in peatlands in five EU countries (Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland), demonstration of the production of low-emission cement and concrete products in France, enhancing the climate resilience of vineyards in Germany and implementing adaptation measures in urban areas in Cyprus. The 56 LIFE Environment ...source Efficiency projects will mobilize \u20ac142.2m, of which the EU will provide \u20ac71.9m. These projects cover actions in five thematic areas: air, environment and health, resource efficiency, waste and water. The 21 resource efficiency projects alone will mobilise \u20ac43.0m that will facilitate Europe's transition to a more circular economy. The 39 LIFE Nature ...odiversity projects support the implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives and the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. They have a total budget of \u20ac158.1m, of which the EU will contribute \u20ac95.6m. The 15 LIFE Environmental Governance and Information projects will raise awareness on environmental matters. They have a total budget of \u20ac23.2m, of which the EU will contribute \u20ac13.8m. The 16 LIFE Climate Change Adaptation projects will mobilize \u20ac32.9m, of which the EU will provide \u20ac19.4m. These action grants are awarded to projects in five thematic areas: agriculture/forestry/tourism, adaptation in mountain/island areas, urban adaptation/planning, vulnerability assessments/adaptation strategies, and water. The 12 LIFE Climate Change Mitigation projects have a total budget of \u20ac35.3m, of which the EU will contribute \u20ac18m. These action grants are awarded to best practice, pilot and demonstration projects in three thematic areas: energy, industry and land use/forestry/agriculture. The six LIFE Climate Governance and Information projects will improve governance and raise awareness of climate change. They have a total budget of \u20ac6.9m, of which the EU will contribute \u20ac4.1m. Descriptions of projects can be found in the annex[2].

It lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class and help America's hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless economic and technological change. And it makes the critical investments needed to accelerate and sustain economic growth in the long run, including in research, education, training, and infrastructure.&lt;nl/&gt; These proposals will help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill, while also fulfilling our most basic responsibility to keep Americans safe. We will make these investments, and end the harmful spending cuts known as sequestration, by cutting inefficient spending and reforming our broken tax code to make sure everyone pays their fair share. We can do all this while also putting our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path. The Budget achieves about $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, primarily from reforms to health programs, our tax code, and immigration.&lt;nl/&gt; *****************************************&lt;nl/&gt; WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET DOES:&lt;nl/&gt; MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY&lt;nl/&gt; In last month's State of the Union, the President laid out his vision for middle class economics: restoring the link between hard work and opportunity, and ensuring that every American has the chance to share in the benefits of economic growth. To achieve this, the Budget invests in helping working families make their paychecks go further, preparing hardworking Americans to earn higher wages, and creating the infrastructure that allows businesses to thrive and create good, high-paying jobs.&lt;nl/&gt; Helping Middle-Class Families Get Ahead&lt;nl/&gt; Middle class economics means ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed in our global economy and all working families can afford the cornerstones of economic security: child care, college, health care, a home, and retirement. The Budget supports working families by reforming the tax code to help middle-class families get ahead, tripling the child care tax credit, expanding child care assistance, encouraging state paid leave initiatives, ensuring access to quality, affordable health care, making two years of community college tuition-free for responsible students, bolstering job training so it leads to careers, expanding access to child care and early education, supporting and rewarding work, and helping families save for retirement.&lt;nl/&gt; Improving Access to High-Quality Child Care and Early Education - High-quality child care and early education for young children serves the important functions of supporting parents in the workforce and helping support healthy child development and school readiness. The Budget aims to ensure that children have access to high quality learning starting at birth, making several key investments:&lt;nl/&gt;Expands access to quality, affordable child care. The Budget proposes a historic investment in child care to ensure that quality, affordable care is available to all eligible low- and moderate-income working families with young children, as opposed to the small share of children who receive this help today. This proposal will expand access to high-quality care for more than 1.1 million additional children under age four by 2025 and help States build a supply of quality care that families can access. Cuts taxes for families paying for child care with a credit of up to $3,000 per child. The Budget triples the maximum Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) for families with children under age five and makes the full CDCTC available to families with incomes of up to $120,000, benefiting families with young children, older children, and dependents who are elderly or have disabilities. The child care tax reforms would benefit 5.1 million families, helping them cover costs for 6.7 million children. Increases the duration of Head Start programs and invests in high quality infant and toddler care. The Budget expands access to high-quality care for tens of thousands of additional infants and toddlers through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, and provides over $1 billion in additional funding for Head Start to make sure children are served in full-day, full-year programs that research shows lead to better outcomes for children. Supports universal preschool. The Preschool for All initiative, in partnership with the States, provides all four-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families with access to high-quality preschool, while encouraging States to expand those programs to reach additional children from middle-class families and establish full-day kindergarten policies. Lays the groundwork for Preschool for All. The Budget provides $750 million for the Department of Education's Preschool Development Grants, a substantial increase of $500 million over the 2015 level. Preschool Development Grants are currently helping 18 States develop and expand high-quality preschool programs in targeted communities; the Budget will increase that number to over 40 States. Invests in voluntary, evidence-based home visiting. The Budget extends and expands evidence-based, voluntary home visiting programs, which enable nurses, social workers, and other professionals to connect families to services to support the child's health, development, and ability to learn.&lt;nl/&gt;Improving Opportunity for All Students - Title I is the Department of Education's largest K-12 grant program and the cornerstone of its commitment to supporting low-income schools with the funding necessary to provide high-need students with access to an excellent education. The Budget increases Title I funding by $1 billion and proposes additional funding to support districts that are using their Federal formula funds for evidence-based interventions. The Budget also makes other important investments in improving K-12 education, increasing. For example, it:&lt;nl/&gt;Increases funding for special education and efforts to assist English language learners. The Budget provides additional funding to help students who face academic hurdles meet rigorous academic standards so that all students can succeed. Provides broad support for educators at every phase of their careers. The Budget invests in developing strong teachers before they reach the classroom and supporting their growth and success throughout their careers. Invests more than $3 billion on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. The Budget provides strong support for STEM education, including a new $125 million competitive program to promote the re-design of America's high schools by integrating deeper learning and student-centered instruction, with a particular focus on STEM-themed high schools that expand opportunities for girls and other groups underrepresented in STEM fields.&lt;nl/&gt;Reforming the Tax Code to Reward and Support Work - When both spouses work, a family incurs additional costs in the form of commuting costs, professional expenses, child care, and, increasingly, elder care. To address these challenges, the Budget proposes a new $500 'second earner' tax credit, which will benefit 24 million dual-earner couples. It also proposes to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for workers without children and non-custodial parents, promoting employment while reducing poverty and hardship for 13.2 million low-income workers struggling to make ends meet. In addition, the Budget continues to propose making permanent improvements to the EITC and Child Tax Credit that augment wages for 16 million families with 29 million children each year but are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Allowing these benefits to expire would result in a roughly $1,700 tax increase for a full-time minimum wage worker with two children.&lt;nl/&gt; Encouraging State Paid Leave Initiatives - Too many American workers must make the painful choice between caring for their families and a paycheck they desperately need. A handful of States have enacted policies to offer paid leave. The Budget encourages additional States to develop paid family leave programs by providing funding for the initial set-up and half of the benefit costs for as many as five States through the Paid Leave Partnership Initiative. It also provides support and technical assistance to those States that are still building the infrastructure they need to launch programs in the future through the State Paid Leave Fund.&lt;nl/&gt; Ensuring Access to Quality, Affordable Health Care - The Budget supports the Affordable Care Act, which is already providing coverage for millions of Americans through the Health Insurance Marketplaces, the delivery of tax credits to make coverage affordable, and the expansion of Medicaid.&lt;nl/&gt; Helping All Workers Save for Retirement - Millions of working Americans lack access to a retirement savings plan at work. Fewer than 10 percent of those without plans at work save in a retirement account on their own. In 2015, retirement security will be one of the key topics of the White House Conference on Aging. The Budget would make it easy and automatic for workers to save for retirement through their employer - giving 30 million more workers access to a workplace savings opportunity. The Budget also ensures that long-term part-time employees can participate in their employers' retirement plans and provides tax incentives to offset administrative expenses for small businesses that adopt retirement plans.&lt;nl/&gt; Partnering With Communities to Expand Opportunity - The Budget improves the coordination of resources to meet unique community needs and growth opportunities, including through the Administration's Promise Zones initiative, which is creating partnerships between the Federal Government, local communities, and businesses to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, increase access to quality, affordable housing, and improve public safety. The President named the first five Promise Zones in 2014 and will designate an additional 15 Zones by the end of calendar year 2016. In support of Promise Zones, the Budget requests $250 million for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Choice Neighborhoods program and $150 million for the Department of Education's Promise Neighborhoods program. The Budget also includes Promise Zone tax incentives to stimulate growth and investments in targeted communities.&lt;nl/&gt; Supporting Innovative Projects to Improve Upward Mobility - Building on Promise Zones, the budget also includes a new initiative, the Upward Mobility Project, that will allow up to ten communities, States or consortia of States and communities to combine funds from four existing block grant programs designed to promote opportunity and economic development and reduce poverty to test and validate promising approaches to help families become more self-sufficient, improve children's outcomes, and revitalize communities so they can provide more opportunities for their residents. Projects must utilize evidence-based strategies, track program performance, and evaluate intervention effectiveness. The funding streams that States and communities can apply to use - including the Department of Health and Human Services' Social Services Block Grant and Community Services Block Grant, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant, and HOME Investment Partnerships Program - share a common goal of promoting opportunity and reducing poverty. In addition to these funds, participating communities will be eligible to receive a total of $1.5 billion in new funding over five years, to combine with the added flexibility with currently provided resources.&lt;nl/&gt; Helping Americans Upgrade Their Skills&lt;nl/&gt; America's education system led the world in the 20th Century, when we sent generations to college and cultivated the most educated workforce in the world, supporting an unparalleled period of economic growth and rising middle-class incomes. Since then, other countries have followed our lead to develop globally competitive education systems. As our economy changes, we need to ensure that Americans are prepared with the skills and knowledge necessary to compete in the 21st Century economy. The Administration invests in affordable post-secondary education and builds on the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) with investments that connect workers with good jobs and prepare them with skills employers need.&lt;nl/&gt; Making a High-Quality College Education More Affordable&lt;nl/&gt; An estimated two-thirds of job openings will require some postsecondary education and training by 2020. The Budget:&lt;nl/&gt;Provides Tuition-Free Community College for Responsible Students. The President's America's College Promise proposal creates new federal-state partnerships to provide two years of free community college to responsible students, while promoting key reforms to improve the quality of community college offerings to ensure that they are a gateway to a career or four-year degree. If all states participate, an estimated 9 million students could benefit from this proposal. Ensures that Pell Grants Keep Pace with Inflation. Pell Grants are central to our efforts to help low and moderate income students afford college. Since 2013, Pell Grants have been adjusted for inflation annually, but unless Congress acts, this will end in 2017 and the value of Pell Grants will start to erode. The Budget continues the President's commitment to college affordability by ensuring that Pell Grants keep pace with inflation. Keeps Student Loans Manageable. The Administration is helping student borrowers with existing debt manage their obligations through income-driven repayment plans, such as the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) plan, which caps student loan payments at 10 percent of monthly discretionary income. The Budget proposes to extend PAYE to all student borrowers and reform the PAYE terms to ensure that the program is well-targeted and to safeguard the program for the future. Simplifies and Expands Education Tax Benefits. While the creation of the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) in 2009 made college more affordable for millions of students and their families, our system of tax incentives for higher education is complex, and families are sometimes unable to take full advantage of the benefits. Building on bipartisan reform proposals, the Budget would simplify, consolidate, and expand higher education tax credits. It would cut taxes for 8.5 million families and students, simplify taxes for the more than 25 million families and students that claim education tax benefits, and would provide students working toward a college degree with up to $2,500 of assistance each year for five years. Building on recent bipartisan legislation, the Budget also includes a proposal to significantly simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Drives Performance and Innovation in Higher Education. The Budget invests in evidence-based efforts at colleges and universities to dramatically improve educational outcomes for all students through the First in the World Fund, which recognizes that leading the world in education requires higher college graduation rates, not just attendance.&lt;nl/&gt;Expanding Technical Training Programs for Middle Class Jobs. Community colleges, like those in Tennessee and Texas, that build strong employer partnerships and offer training in in-demand fields are creating career pathways to the middle class. The Budget requests $200 million for a new American Technical Training Fund to create or expand innovative, evidence-based job training programs in high-demand fields that provide a path to the middle class for hard-working, low-wage Americans.\u00a0Projects would emphasize strong employer partnerships, work-based learning opportunities, accelerated training, and flexible scheduling for students to accommodate part-time work. Programs could be created within current community colleges, other innovative, non-traditional training providers, or these entities in partnership with secondary programs. This initiative would be housed in the Career and Technical Education Innovation Fund, jointly administered by the Department of Education and the Department of Labor and builds on the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grants (for which 2014 was the final year of funding).&lt;nl/&gt; Creating Pathways to High-Growth Jobs - Building on the important improvements to the Nation's job training system through the WIOA, the Budget proposes to support more in-person career counseling and employment services that help unemployed workers find a career-path job or the training they need to prepare for one. It will double the number of workers receiving training through the workforce development system, with a focus on training partnerships for skills needed in industries and occupations experiencing significant growth in the years ahead.&lt;nl/&gt; Expanding Apprenticeships and Employer-Validated Credentials - The Budget makes investments to achieve the goal of doubling Registered Apprenticeships across the United States over the next five years to allow workers to learn skills while they are earning a paycheck, and ensures that training leads to high-quality jobs by investing in projects that feature strong industry partnerships and incent additional employer investment in worker training.&lt;nl/&gt; Helping Americans Launch and Sustain Their Own Businesses - The Budget funds training to launch and sustain businesses, including the business practices entrepreneurs need to translate a good idea into a growing business. The Small Business Administration's Boots to Business initiative that provides veterans transitioning to civilian life with the training and tools they need to start their own businesses and the Entrepreneurship Education initiative helps small business owners gain the skills and networks they need to grow their business and create new jobs.&lt;nl/&gt; Creating a 21st Century Economy&lt;nl/&gt; Creating jobs that pay good wages is the best way to grow our economy and the middle class. To compete in the 21st Century economy and make America a magnet for job creation and opportunity, we need to invest in American innovation, strengthening our manufacturing base, keeping our Nation at the forefront of technological advancement, and leading in the development of clean energy alternatives and the promotion of energy efficiency while moving toward energy security through safe and responsible domestic energy production. Because a 21st Century economy requires 21st Century infrastructure, the Budget proposes to modernize our ports and build stronger bridges, better roads, faster trains, and better broadband, creating jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, strengthening our communities, and making it easier to do business.&lt;nl/&gt; Expanding the National Network of Manufacturing Institutes - To create jobs, continue growth in the industry, and strengthen America's leadership in advanced manufacturing technology, the Budget provides the resources to launch seven more institutes in 2016, building on the nine institutes already funded through 2015, and calls for the full investment required to complete a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes.&lt;nl/&gt; Investing in Home Grown Products and Ideas - The Budget launches a public-private investment fund for advanced manufacturing start-ups, known as the American Made Scale-Up Fund, to help ensure that if a technology is invented in the United States, it can be made in the United States. The Scale-Up Fund will help emerging American-made advanced manufacturing technologies reach commercial scale production in the United States, creating manufacturing jobs for the future and helping to ensure that America keeps making things the rest of the world wants to buy.&lt;nl/&gt; Rebuilding Our Infrastructure with Transition Revenue from Business Tax Reform - To create jobs, spur economic growth and provide States and localities the certainty they need to plan for the future, the Budget includes a $478 billion, six-year surface transportation reauthorization proposal paid for with transition revenue from pro-growth business tax reform. This transition tax would mean that companies have to pay U.S. tax right now on the $2 trillion they already have overseas, rather than being able to delay paying any U.S. tax indefinitely. The proposal would allow us to repair existing roads and bridges and modernize our infrastructure with new investments in highways, freight networks, and bus, subway, rapid transit, light rail, and passenger rail systems in our cities, fast-growing metropolitan areas, small towns and rural communities across the country.&lt;nl/&gt; Boosting Private Investment through a Rebuild America Partnership - The Budget boosts private investment in infrastructure through a Rebuild America Partnership by establishing an independent National Infrastructure Bank to leverage private and public capital to support infrastructure projects of national and regional significance. The Budget creates America Fast Forward Bonds, which build on the successful Build America Bonds program of taxable bonds. It also creates the new tax-exempt Qualified Public Infrastructure Bonds, which will help states and local communities to attract new sources of capital for infrastructure investment projects.&lt;nl/&gt; Cutting Red Tape in the Infrastructure Permitting Process - The Administration continues to modernize and improve the Federal permitting process\u00a0for major infrastructure projects, cutting through red tape and getting more timely decisions on Federal permits and reviews while ensuring that projects lead to better outcomes for communities and the environment.&lt;nl/&gt; Investing in Innovative Research and Development - Our long-term economic competitiveness depends upon continued robust investment in R...The Budget provides a 6 percent increase for R...including significant investments in basic research and advanced manufacturing technology. The Budget invests in biomedical research\u2014like the BRAIN initiative, which is developing tools and technologies to offer new insight into diseases like Alzheimer's, and Precision Medicine, which can improve health outcomes and better treat diseases. It also emphasizes agricultural research, looking at climate resilience and sustainability.&lt;nl/&gt; Investing in Homegrown Clean Energy - In order to secure America's energy future and protect our children from the impacts of climate change, the Budget invests in clean energy, improving energy security, and enhancing preparedness and resilience to climate change. These investments support the President's Climate Action Plan, helping to expand American leadership in the clean energy economy with new businesses, jobs, and opportunities for American workers.&lt;nl/&gt; Keeping Americans Safe at Home and Abroad&lt;nl/&gt; Economic growth and opportunity can only be achieved if America is safe and secure. The Budget provides $561 billion in base discretionary funding for national defense\u2014$38 billion above sequestration levels\u2014and $58 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations to provide the resources needed to sustain the President's national security strategy, protecting the country's security and well-being both at home and abroad.&lt;nl/&gt; Degrading and Defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) - The Budget provides the necessary resources to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region, continue efforts to train and equip the Iraqi security forces, support regional partners, and bring stability and promote the conditions for a negotiated settlement to end the conflict in Syria.&lt;nl/&gt; Countering Russian Pressure and Aggressive Action Together with our European Allies - In response to the Russian Federation's aggressive acts, the Budget includes proposals for political, economic, and military support to NATO allies and partner states in Europe, including the governments most targeted by Russian pressure. This includes funding to support efforts to bolster democracy and good governance, increase the capabilities of security forces, strengthen the rule of law and anti-corruption measures, and promote European Union integration, trade, and energy security.&lt;nl/&gt; Promoting Prosperity, Security and Good Governance in Central America - The Budget provides $1 billion to support a long-term, comprehensive strategy for Central America designed to contribute to the evolution of an economically-integrated Central America that is fully democratic, provides greater economic opportunities to its people, promotes more accountable, transparent, and effective public institutions and ensures the safety of its citizens, addressing the challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration from the region.&lt;nl/&gt; Protecting our Nation Against Cyber-Attacks - No system is immune to infiltration by those seeking to steal commercial or Government information and property or perpetrate malicious and disruptive activity. The Budget provides $14 billion to support cybersecurity efforts across the Government to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity defenses and make cyberspace more secure, allowing the Government to more rapidly protect American citizens, systems, and information from cyber threats.&lt;nl/&gt; Confronting the Threat Posed by Infectious Diseases - The Budget provides resources to support the Global Health Security Agenda, increases funding to eradicate polio and other global health challenges, and creates a new Impact Fund for targeted global HIV/AIDS efforts. In addition, the Budget increases funding for domestic preparedness efforts to more effectively and efficiently respond to potential future outbreaks here at home. The Budget also makes investments to address the domestic HIV epidemic to help States develop HIV implementation plans to support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.&lt;nl/&gt; Combatting Prescription Drug and Heroin Abuse - The Budget includes more than $100 million in new investments across HHS to reduce abuse of prescription opioids and heroin, which together take the lives of 20,000 Americans per year. These new resources will increases funding for every state to expand existing Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs; expand and improve the treatment for people who abuse heroin and prescription opioids; and support dissemination of naloxone, an opioid antagonist that reverses the effects of opioid overdose, by first responders in an effort to prevent overdose deaths in high risk communities.&lt;nl/&gt; Honoring Our Commitment to Veterans - The Budget invests in the five pillars the President has outlined to support our Nation's veterans: providing the resources and funding they deserve, ensuring high-quality and timely health care, getting veterans their earned benefits quickly and efficiently, ending veteran homelessness, and helping veterans and their families get good jobs, education, and access to affordable housing.&lt;nl/&gt; Creating a Government for the Future&lt;nl/&gt; The President is committed to creating a Government that makes a significant, tangible, and positive difference in the economy and the lives of the American people, and to driving lasting change in how Government works. This Administration has launched successful efforts to eliminate wasteful IT spending, reduce the Federal real property footprint, modernize and improve citizen-facing services, and open tens of thousands of Federal data sets to spur innovation in the private sector.&lt;nl/&gt; Supporting the President's Management Agenda - The Budget includes initiatives to improve the service we provide to the American public; to leverage the Federal Government's buying power to bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars; to open Government data and research to the private sector to drive innovation and economic growth; to promote smarter information technology; create new Idea Labs to support employees with promising ideas, and, to attract and retain the best talent in the Federal workforce.&lt;nl/&gt; Supporting Digital Service Delivery for Citizens - In 2014 the Administration piloted the U.S. Digital Service, a unit of innovators, entrepreneurs, and engineers. This team of America's best digital experts has worked in collaboration with Federal agencies on their high impact, citizen-facing programs to improve how citizens and businesses experience government services. The Budget includes $105 million to scale and institutionalize this approach and create digital services teams in 25 key agencies. It also includes increased funding to scale up the central USDS team to aid in building the agency teams, increase oversight and accountability for IT spending, improve IT procurement, and improve agency cybersecurity and cyber readiness.&lt;nl/&gt; Building Evidence and Encouraging Innovation - The Budget invests in developing and testing effective practices, recruiting social and behavioral sciences experts, and providing better information on what works in key areas ranging from improving college completion to creating greater accountability for job training programs to improving the data available on Indian Country.&lt;nl/&gt; Reforming the Government to Win in the Global Economy - The Budget also includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize Government agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it increases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on programs that work.&lt;nl/&gt; Achieving Fiscal Sustainability and Promoting Sustainable Growth&lt;nl/&gt; This year's Budget supports the President's ambitious vision for supporting growth and opportunity, and does so while meeting a key test of fiscal stability: reducing deficits to below 3 percent of GDP, stabilizing debt as a share of the economy, and putting it on a declining path. It achieves these goals by replacing mindless austerity with smart reforms, paying for all new investments, and obtaining $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction primarily from health, tax, and immigration reforms.&lt;nl/&gt; Reversing Mindless Austerity - Returning to the mindless austerity of sequestration in 2016 would bring discretionary funding to its lowest level, adjusted for inflation, since 2006. The Budget proposes to end sequestration, fully reversing it for domestic priorities in 2016, matched by equal dollar increases for defense funding. These investments are more than paid for with smart spending cuts, program integrity measures, and commonsense loophole closers - including, for example, targeted reforms to crop insurance programs; program integrity investments across a range of programs; and closing the 'carried interest' tax loophole.&lt;nl/&gt; While many of the investments described above are made possible by reversing sequestration, the contrast between what can be achieved under sequestration versus under the President's Budget is particularly stark in a few key areas:&lt;nl/&gt;Research and Development. Under 2016 sequestration levels, assuming roughly current funding patterns, research funding adjusted for inflation would reach its lowest levels since 2002 - other than when sequestration was in full effect in 2013. By comparison, the President's Budget would increase R...unding by nearly 6 percent over 2015, including investments in Precision Medicine, the Brain Initiative, and other areas. Early Learning. The last time sequestration took full effect in 2013, more than 57,000 children lost access to Head Start and Early Head Start, with enrollment falling to the lowest level since 2001. Researchers have established that supporting children during this critical stage yields benefits that far outweigh the costs of the investment. The President's Budget makes major investments in early learning (described above), including, for example, making sure children can be served in full-day, full-year Head Start programs that research shows lead to better outcomes for kids. National Security. The Joint Chiefs have made clear that a return to sequestration-level cuts would significantly reduce the military's ability to fully implement the President's defense strategy. The military would be unbalanced and eventually too small and insufficiently modern to meet the needs of our strategy, leading to greater risk of longer wars with higher casualties for the United States and our allies and partners. In contrast, the Budget makes the investments needed to protect the Nation's security and well-being both at home and abroad.&lt;nl/&gt;Paying for all new investments - Every investment in the Budget - including the new and expanded tax credits for middle-class and working families, and mandatory investments in community college and preschool - is more than fully paid for through spending or tax reforms. In particular, the Budget pays for many of its investments in helping middle class families get ahead through three important reforms to the tax system. First, it would eliminate what may be the largest single loophole in the tax code - a provision known as 'stepped-up basis' that lets wealthy households avoid taxes on hundreds of billions in capital gains taxes each year. Second, it would raise the top capital gains and dividend rate for high-income households to 28 percent, the rate under President Reagan. Third, it reforms financial sector taxation to make it more costly for large, highly-leveraged financial firms to finance their activities with excessive borrowing, reducing risks to the broader economy.&lt;nl/&gt; Reducing Deficits through Health, Tax, and Immigration Reform - While the Budget's new investments are paid for with smart reforms across a range of programs, as well as commonsense tax loophole closers, the $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction in the Budget is achieved primarily by focusing on the key drivers of our Budget challenges: health care cost growth and inadequate revenue levels in the face of an aging population. Specifically, the Budget includes:&lt;nl/&gt;$400 Billion in Health Savings. Over the last few years, we've seen historically slow rates of health care cost growth, which are already yielding fiscal dividends. The Budget includes $400 billion in health savings that build on the Affordable Care Act to help maintain slower cost growth while improving health care quality - complementing the Administration's other efforts on delivery system reform. Notably, the Budget's health savings grow over time - raising about $1 trillion in the second decade, and extending the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund solvency by approximately 5 years. $640 Billion in Net Deficit Reduction from Tax Reforms. The Budget raises about $640 billion in net revenue for deficit reduction from curbing high-income tax expenditures. These savings come from limiting tax benefits that are not efficient in achieving social goals, raising revenue without raising tax rates. $160 Billion in Savings from Immigration Reform. This year's Budget again reflects the President's support for commonsense, comprehensive immigration reform along the lines of the bipartisan Senate-passed bill. In part because it helps balance out an aging population, immigration reform helps both the Budget - by almost $1 trillion over two decades - and the Social Security Trust Fund, closing about 8 percent of the Trust Fund shortfall and moving insolvency out two years. It also strengthens the economy by boosting GDP growth, reducing the deficit, raising average wages for U.S.-born and immigrant workers, increasing the size of the labor force, and raising productivity.&lt;nl/&gt;Through these policies, the President's Budget brings annual deficits well below the 40-year historical average of 3.2 percent of GDP during every year of the budget window. A key test of fiscal sustainability is whether debt is stable or declining as a share of the economy, resulting in interest payments that consume a stable or falling share of the Nation's resources over time. The Budget meets that test, showing that investments in growth and opportunity are compatible with also putting the Nation's finances on a strong and sustainable path.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;source: WhiteHouse.gov[1]&lt;nl/&gt; [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "Everything Urban + RadioScope", "instances": ["including significant investments in basic research and advanced manufacturing technology.

These investments support the President's Climate Action Plan, helping to expand American leadership in the clean energy economy with new businesses, jobs, and opportunities for American workers."]}, {"relevance_score": 8, "title": "EU invests over (EURO)380 million in 133 new LIFE projects to support the green transition across Europe", "published": "2024-10-23", "bodyText": "<p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.
