They also have implications for food security issues in Asean.</p><p> Health and nature-based solutions are two other sectors which philanthropies can support, as they show potential for commercial viability. The education sector, however, remains challenging. </p><p> Besides philanthropic capital, another source of funding that remains relatively untapped in South-east Asia is public finance, said Thakkar. </p><p> Government funds have traditionally been used in the form of grants via welfare schemes. </p><p> But Thakkar said there are opportunities for public finance to be deployed through local development finance institutions. </p><p> While multilateral development banks and international development finance institutions are traditionally the entities helping to arrange blended finance transactions, they usually provide financing solutions only in hard currencies, rather than local currencies.</p><p> This could increase the costs of capital, making it harder for projects to take off. </p><p> Home-grown solutionsLocal development finance institutions, however, are able to provide more home-grown solutions in local currencies, by working with the local government and other stakeholders in a way that aligns with their own policy priorities and national climate targets.</p><p> \"The governments can set the direction for the country itself, and then look at what solutions, products or sectors should be catalysed through the local development finance institutions,\" said Thakkar. </p><p> Local mobilisation is even more important now, with foreign aid being cut on several fronts. The United States has dismantled its foreign aid agency USAid, while the United Kingdom and several European governments have also reduced their funding for Official Development Assistance. </p><p> Donor agencies from these developed markets have been one of the most frequent investors in blended finance. </p><p> Several South-east Asian countries -- including Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines -- already have their own local development finance institutions. </p><p> \"What role could they play, which can then catalyse more of these home-grown solutions, local currency solutions, to work in that direction? So I think, to me, the answer is really a whole aspect of local mobilisation,\" said Thakkar. </p><p> He added that Convergence is currently working with the United Nations Development Programme to develop a framework for blended finance for emerging Asian markets so that there can be more local capital mobilisation suited to their country's context. </p><p> Given that South-east Asia has a healthy gross domestic product per capita, decent savings rate, strong financial sector with ample liquidity, as well as relatively developed capital markets, Thakkar said that the region already has the right mix of ingredients to pull local pools of capital into areas where it is not currently flowing. </p><p> \"I think a bit of a regulatory intervention, a bit of thinking through this very strategically -- both from the concessional as well as the commercial actors -- and... looking at some form of platforms that standardise ways to do blended deals would be a good recipe,\" he said.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["A MISALIGNMENT between the aims of blended finance initiatives and philanthropies in South-east Asia is holding back the flow of such capital in the region.

It is very costly to try to out-engineer nature all the time,\" Prof Huang said. </p><p> The National Environment Agency told ST it is looking into the possible use of mangroves as a nature-based solution to protect Semakau Landfill against coastal erosion and sea-level rise.</p><p> Predicting extreme weather Developing the most optimal coastal protection solutions requires an understanding of how bad flooding could get. </p><p> Seven of CFI's projects are dedicated to coastal science and predicting extreme events. </p><p> In one of the projects, Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) researchers are building a model that can predict storm surges within five days, so that residents and businesses can take emergency measures. </p><p> These measures could include staying indoors, moving vehicles to higher ground and installing barriers to prevent losses caused by coastal flooding. </p><p> Storm surges are higher-than-usual tides caused by offshore storms. Areas in Singapore that are most at risk from storm surges are likely to be the East Coast and Jurong Island, said Associate Professor Tay Zhi Yung from SIT's engineering cluster. </p><p> Current-wave and storm-surge models near Singapore's coasts are based on physics and mathematical equations.</p><p>SIT's model integrates machine learning with existing weather data, such as wind forecasts, to improve the accuracy of storm-surge predictions.</p><p> \"A data-driven model can provide much faster predictions when compared with physics-based models,\" said the project's lead, Associate Professor Victor Wang of SIT's engineering cluster. </p><p> The four-year project is currently 1 1/2  years in, and the team is looking to incorporate other elements like sustained wind speed and rainfall to improve the model. </p><p> The other related projects are looking at predicting intense rain and other extreme coastal events more accurately. </p><p> \"The eventual goal is to develop reliable early warning and operation response for coastal-related flooding occurrences,\" said Prof Wang. </p><p> Separately, since 2021, PUB has been building a $13.4 million model that can simulate and evaluate inland and coastal floods in tandem, based on the latest climate projections. </p><p> When high tide happens to coincide with an intense deluge, coastal flooding worsens. This coastal-inland flood model is currently being validated and undergoing pilot testing, said Ms Hazel Khoo, director of the coastal protection department at national water agency PUB. </p><p> Flexible, multi-use optionsSingapore is also looking at flexible structures that can help it tackle sea-level rise across a range of different scenarios. </p><p> This could include, for example, flexible seawalls with adjustable heights or modular units that can be added to seawalls.</p><p> Existing structures used for coastal protection typically do not allow provisions for subsequent add-ons or modifications to adapt to rising sea levels. </p><p> But innovative engineering solutions can be deployed to better utilise land. They can also be adapted to future requirements and have multiple uses beyond protecting against sea-level rise. </p><p> Flood risk expert Matthijs Bos -- who works at global engineering consultancy Haskoning -- said Singapore could take reference from a sea-facing boulevard in The Hague, Netherlands, which doubles as a recreational spot on good weather days. </p><p> The popular Scheveningen Boulevard sits on top of a hidden sea wall -- replacing a former sand dune ridge -- and in front of it lies a widened beach that was topped up with sand. </p><p> The nourished beach acts as a buffer to weaken waves, and the sea wall prevents the boulevard from flooding during storm events. </p><p> Mr Bos envisions the future Long Island having a similar concept. </p><p> \"For the outer edge facing the sea of Long Island, they will make sure it's not only a coastal protection but maybe a nice recreational area to go to. It could be a new waterfront,\" he said. </p><p> Researchers are also studying whether a flexible seawall with adjustable heights can support a concrete structure that allows for multi-function uses, such as a road or a park.</p><p> The flexible seawall can also be used to separate water bodies to form a coastal reservoir that can be used as a water catchment area to reduce inland flooding and for freshwater storage. </p><p>Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Professor Chu Jian, the project's principal investigator, said the flexible seawall will also be more cost-effective as less material is needed to build it.</p><p> \"If you integrate it for other uses, the overall cost will be much cheaper as it also provides infrastructure,\" he said. </p><p> The three-year project, which started in November 2023, mainly focuses on the design and modelling of the wall. </p><p> Existing coastal protection structures can also be retrofitted with innovative solutions such as adding modular, watertight units on top of seawalls. </p><p> PUB is working with Delta Marine Consultants to explore the use of modular blocks known as XblocPlus -- a single layer concrete armour unit placed in a regular pattern along the shoreline -- on Singapore's coastlines. </p><p> It is a flexible and scalable design that minimises land take, as well as has the potential to be integrated with urban developments or natural habitats. The firm is looking forward to potentially test-bed and pilot these blocks here.</p><p> While the aim is to protect every corner of our coastline from flood waters, there might be a situation where some parts of the island -- more remote and with lower footfall -- may be left to flood once in a while, suggested Mr Bos and Mr James Lam, Surbana Jurong's executive director for coastal engineering. </p><p> These floodable areas could be coastal parks, nature spots and beach areas. </p><p> Mr Lam said: \"Certain places could tolerate flooding for a few hours before it subsides.

They are deeply intertwined. They're actually not three different markets-they're really one challenge we face in the shifting ecology of the planet.</p><p>That challenge of global warming, water scarcity (and) the fact that the global water cycle is out of kilter, and the progressive loss of biodiversity, are reinforcing each other. And they now form a vicious cycle. If we don't manage water well-if we let soil health deteriorate, lose moisture in the soil, and degrade the wetlands-we also reduce carbon sequestration, which accelerates global warming. And global warming then dries the soil, leads to further problems with the forests, and you get that vicious cycle. So, we are dealing with something that the science is very clear on, but it must be reflected in our governance approaches, our policies, and our financing strategies. Including one of the important areas of potential, which is in developing the market for credits. Just like we've got carbon credits, we need to develop the market for water credits and biodiversity credits. I'll come back to that in a moment.</p><p>Nature-based solutions are an extremely important part of climate change mitigation. You can argue about exactly what percentage of mitigation should come down to nature-based solutions, but we know that there's much good that arises from nature-based solutions. It's not just about reducing carbon emissions or capturing more carbon, but also about the co-benefits of nature-based solutions: reducing heat, reducing the spread of diseases, and a whole set of other benefits.</p><p>But think of nature-based solutions not just in terms of carbon. Think of nature-based solutions as a way of managing water, reducing carbon emissions, and preserving biodiversity. Because when you put them together, the ripple effects give them a much larger impact.</p><p>To give you an example. We need to transform the agri-food industry. Regenerative agriculture, which is already well underway in many parts of the world, will help preserve soil health, preserve carbon in the soil, and improve yields with appropriate incentives and technologies. They help farmers and consumers. And you have to remember that the agri-food industry is also the biggest source of deforestation and the loss of biodiversity.</p><p>Think of rice, which is a major issue in Asia especially, but also in some other parts of the world. We have to move, fundamentally, from the predominant system of rice cultivation-the flooding of padi fields, which leads to high methane emissions, farmers pumping water from underground using energy, and a significant amount of water being wasted.</p><p>With more sustainable rice production-using techniques like direct seeding of rice, and alternate wetting and drying, you can save 50 percent of methane emissions, 30 percent of water, and some 60 percent of energy. And improve yields at the same time. So, it's an example of how you can address several problems at the same time.</p><p>This brings me to financing, because nature-based solutions are significantly underfunded. It's rested largely on governments. The private sector is still at the nascent stage of getting into nature-based investments as a way of addressing climate change.</p><p>The carbon credits market already has an ecosystem. There are integrity issues and greenwashing issues, but improvements are being made. The ICVCM, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Markets, and the SBTI, the Science-Based Targets Initiative, and others -there's a lot of good work taking place to improve integrity and trust in the markets. And I believe this is going to be a significant source of financing for nature-based solutions.</p><p>Now, we can't-I think it will be very difficult-to create a whole ecosystem for sustainable water credits, and biodiversity credits, side by side with carbon credits. It can be done in theory, but it's going to exhaust the private sector, and it's going to exhaust negotiators.</p><p>Much better that we work on a reliable carbon credit system. And have water and biodiversity credits stapled on. They are still in their infancy. There are biodiversity credits that are currently being stapled on, but it's being done qualitatively because we don't yet have precise, quantitative ways of assessing biodiversity benefits in a way that can be compared across different projects, regions, and geographies.</p><p>In other words, there's no common currency. But even the qualitative approach has led to a premium on carbon credits that have biodiversity stapled onto it. We can do the same with water.</p><p>And remember: water will not just enhance the value of the carbon credits. The benefits of sustainable water practices can be reaped earlier and in a way that local communities see as benefiting themselves. It's not just for the markets-people see the benefits.</p><p>I think the WEF should work with other coalitions to develop some rigor in this process. How do we develop the biodiversity and water credit markets?

Ocean decade actions are science-based programmes, projects or activities endorsed by the UN to improve ocean health.</p><p> \"Small island developing states have been the subjects of ocean research for too long, the observation points in data sets, the case studies in reports, and the vulnerable communities in impact assessments,\" Dr Balakrishnan said on the first day of the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France. </p><p> \"Small island states are rarely the lead researchers, rarely the owners of our own ocean data. We believe that it is time to change that narrative,\" he added. </p><p> A large part of the summit, which ends on June 13, focuses on boosting support for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources. Representatives from 193 countries are expected to attend.</p><p> Dr Balakrishnan, who is leading a Singapore delegation, was speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis) on the need for scientific cooperation for ocean health. Aosis groups 39 small-island and low-lying coastal developing states including Singapore, Palau, the Maldives and Belize. </p><p> Ocean-related scientific research tends to be dominated by Western scientific institutions and groups, which have access to large  research vessels and instruments that can withstand the inhospitable conditions of the deep sea. Tropical marine habitats like coral reefs are also well studied by scientists from other parts of the world. </p><p> However, the High Seas Treaty adopted in 2023 made it clear that such research would benefit from being more collaborative, calling on countries to provide \"opportunities for scientists of all states, in particular scientists from developing states, to be involved in or associated with the project\". </p><p> The treaty is a historic agreement that lays the groundwork for international collaboration to protect oceanic areas outside national jurisdictions.</p><p> Dr Balakrishnan said: \"Ocean science is not an academic luxury. Instead, it is an existential necessity for all of us small island states. The well-being of our communities, cultures, ecosystems, food security and livelihoods are dependent on a healthy and thriving ocean.\"</p><p> The ocean is also a treasure trove of information yet unknown, with unique organisms offering scientists the chance to obtain valuable scientific data that can improve life on land. A glow-in-the-dark jelly--fish, for instance, inspired the development of a fluorescent dye that enabled doctors to track the movement of cancer cells. </p><p> Dr Balakrishnan said Aosis member states are calling for more capacity-building initiatives based on their needs, and the need to include traditional and indigenous knowledge into global frameworks from the outset. </p><p> Aosis is calling for a \"fundamental rebalancing of ocean science leadership\", he said. \"We need dedicated funding mechanisms and institutional support to ensure small island developing states' research institutions can lead initiatives that address our specific challenges.\"</p><p>Singapore has a thriving marine research community, with a national facility -- the St John's Island National Marine Laboratory -- and a research institute focusing on marine science, the Tropical Marine Science Institute at NUS.</p><p> Researchers from these institutions, the National Parks Board (NParks) and NTU's Asian School of the Environment and Earth Observatory of Singapore are active in initiating and conducting  studies of the marine environment. </p><p> These include research on marine creatures such as reef fish and giant clams, as well as in coral reefs, seagrass meadows and other marine ecosystems. Underwater robotics and studies on oceanographic parameters like waves are also done in Singapore. </p><p> The focus on the need for a strong scientific basis in ocean policy was further underpinned by an event held ahead of the UN Ocean Conference that served as the scientific foundation of the summit. </p><p> The One Ocean Science Congress, held in Nice from June 3 to 6, was attended by Dr Karenne Tun, group director of the National Biodiversity Centre at NParks.</p><p> She told The Straits Times that the congress offered NParks, Singapore's lead agency for marine conservation, the opportunity to both learn and contribute to the global scientific community. </p><p> \"As a small island city-state, Singapore is surrounded by coastal and marine areas that are vital not only to our own environment, but also integral to the broader South-east Asian region,\" she said.  </p><p>Singapore's waters are home to some 250 hard coral species and about 700 marine fish species.

Why are investors hesitant, and what needs to be done to get climate-aware investing into the mainstream'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Helge Muenkel: We have witnessed continuous improvement and strong efforts to transition our global economies to a net-zero future. According to the International Energy Agency, last year's global investments in clean energy were around double the amount going into fossil fuels. Ten years ago, fossil fuel investments were about 20 per cent larger than clean energy investments. Meanwhile, India is projected to achieve a major milestone in 2025, with renewable electricity providing for more than half of the country's power capacity, while China added more renewable power capacity in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Notwithstanding this, current investment flows are still insufficient to allow us to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, complexities in the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape have understandably made investors more cautious in recent times. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Importantly, sustainable investing is not a short-term but a structural trend. Climate risk is increasingly recognised as a major driver of financial risk. Hence, most major investors integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their overall decision process.</p><p> Encouragingly, Asian regulators are stepping up. Across the region, many policies and regulations have been put in place that create an enabling environment, which supports climate action and related financing flows. This includes green and transition taxonomies and ESG disclosure standards.</p><p>  These developments bolster investor confidence and embed greater transparency in sustainable investing -- important steps in shifting these financing flows into the mainstream.</p><p> More work needs to be done. For instance, there is some ambiguity around what qualifies as transition and transition finance. The vast majority of assets and economic activities globally and in Asia are not yet green, and DBS believes it is critical to also allocate capital to support their transition to becoming greener. Beyond financing those assets and activities, transition finance can also help companies transform their entire businesses, all of which will contribute to the greening of the entire economy. </p><p> We see progress across the region on several fronts. Localised taxonomies are evolving to reflect regional contexts and developmental needs. Markets like Singapore are evolving disclosure rules and incentives for credible transition finance. </p><p> At DBS, we have observed growing sophistication in how capital is being deployed. For instance, we saw strong investor appetite for two green bonds DBS brought to the market recently. The first was the issuance of Equinix's S$500 million green bond in March 2025, its first Singapore dollar issuance. </p><p> The second was Asia's first public sustainability-linked securities offering by ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in January 2024. Both bonds were meaningfully oversubscribed, signalling growing investor demand for credible climate instruments.</p><p> Victor Wong: Investors' hesitation around sustainable or climate-aware investing, despite growing interest, often stems from structural challenges and other key concerns. </p><p> For example, the lack of standardisation and transparency in how ESG factors are assessed and reported. Without consistent metrics, it becomes difficult for investors to compare ESG investment products and evaluate their true impact. Additionally, some investors are concerned that corporates and governments may scale back their climate commitments which affect the short-term viability of such investments.</p><p> At UOB Asset Management, we view ESG integration as a strategic tool for value creation and risk mitigation. By embedding ESG considerations into our investment process, we aim to support long-term sustainability for our investees and their businesses. We also recognise that some investors may wish to explore and capitalise on advanced strategies to achieve specific impact or invest in specific themes. To meet these needs, we make ESG a core element of our investment thesis, aligning our strategies with both market realities and investor aspirations.</p><p> Mike Ng: One of the key considerations for investors when it comes to their investment decisions is the potential return. The recent increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape have tested investors' appetite to commit to sustainable investments since they are unsure about the future regulatory environment and the impact it may have on their investment returns. In addition, some investors may be hesitant given concerns about low-quality ESG data, greenwashing, as well as the perceived trade-off between sustainability and returns.</p><p> While interest in sustainable investment may fluctuate from time to time due to market sentiments and the geopolitical context, we believe that the overarching trend towards investments that take ESG factors and risks into consideration is here to stay. The challenges of sustainable investment are also being actively addressed. </p><p> Collaboration between stakeholders -- asset managers, data providers and regulatory bodies -- is paving the way for more standardisation in reporting frameworks and taxonomies, which will help mitigate concerns on data quality and greenwashing. Meanwhile, leading financial institutions are developing diverse and accessible products catering to varying preferences and risks appetites, and -- over time -- are also showing that sustainable investments can deliver required returns. </p><p> Sometimes, enabling investors with information can also make a big difference in mainstreaming sustainable investing. Take, for example, the OCBC Sustainability Hub, launched in 2024.</p><p>  The innovative platform empowers investors with a personal ESG rating, enabling them to track, understand and act on their investments, and to make informed financial decisions.</p><p>  Within just six months of its launch, the Sustainability Hub achieved a 2.3x year-on-year increase in sustainability-themed investments.</p><p> BT: What do you see as the most promising areas of investments for corporates and individuals that will address climate risks and reap a </p><p> return'</p><p> Helge Muenkel: The business case for climate-aligned investing remains robust particularly in Asia, where climate risk is acute, economic growth is rapid, and the green transition is gaining momentum.</p><p> We see strong opportunities emerging across several areas that offer both meaningful climate impact and attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p><p> One such area is energy. Investments in solar, wind and battery storage systems are increasingly competitive against fossil fuel alternatives. More importantly, enablers such as smart grids and demand management technologies -- especially in high-growth urban centres -- are essential to stabilising renewable energy supply and unlocking further scale.</p><p> Mobility is another sector where climate action meets opportunity. Across Asia, countries are racing ahead in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, charging infrastructure and intelligent traffic systems. Innovations such as ultra-fast charging and connected transport systems are also improving convenience and range, spurring consumer adoption. </p><p> Investors are increasingly focused on mobility platforms, EV supply chains and battery recycling, all of which present strong growth prospects as urbanisation and climate pressure reshape how people and goods move across the region.</p><p> In the agriculture sector, South-east Asia's role as a major rice producer makes agricultural adaptation a top priority. Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods. </p><p> With strong social returns, such investments are increasingly attracting private capital, from agribusinesses investing in resilient seeds to impact investors funding water-saving irrigation technologies.</p><p> Another high-impact, cost-effective climate adaptation strategy is investing in nature-based solutions. </p><p> Restoring and protecting ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs and forests provides \"natural infrastructure\" that reduces disaster risks, regulates water flows, buffers heat and sequesters carbon.</p><p>  For instance, mangrove restoration in Vietnam and the Philippines has proven effective in shielding coastal communities from storm surges. These solutions are relatively low-cost compared to traditional infrastructure such as concrete sea walls. </p><p> We are also seeing transition finance emerge as an investment theme, which is why we enhanced our Transition Finance Framework in 2025 -- to provide clients and stakeholders with greater clarity and transparency on eligible transition financing activities and enhance access to the financial resources required to accelerate climate action. This creates confidence not just for the bank but also for other ecosystem players.</p><p> Victor Wong: Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to gain traction as demand for clean power grows. Promising investment areas that address climate risks while delivering returns include:</p><p> Mike Ng: In its 2025 Supertrends Report, the chief investment office at our private banking subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, stated its view that the power-hungry nature of technology and the energy transition will accelerate over the medium term. This will be fuelled by the proliferation of AI use cases and the accelerating demand growth for electricity over the long term, driven by developments in the clean energy transition, electric mobility, cooling, data centres and AI sectors. </p><p> As improvements in energy efficiencies of data centres, cooling and power systems infrastructure will be required, the search for cleaner energy sources including solar, wind and nuclear technologies to supplement existing energy sources will present investment opportunities.</p><p> While the US has sidelined the green agenda for now, the global shift towards clean energy remains crucial for humanity's long-term survival and offers substantial economic and investment prospects. According to a World Economic Forum White Paper from 2023, an estimated additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and 232 million new jobs could be created in Asia by 2030 due to climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. We see opportunities in companies with exposure to clean energy and EVs, as well as transition enablers focused on smart grid infrastructure, energy storage and efficiency, and producers of metals and minerals. </p><p> Policy shifts have also enabled the oil and gas industry to be part of the energy transition, by leveraging technology -- bioenergy and carbon capture -- and the ability to manage complex energy systems.</p><p> From a geographical perspective, China in particular has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for over 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> BT: Plugging the funding gap to </p><p> mitigate climate risks is even more challenging today amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical </p><p> tensions. What do you see as the most promising sources of capital that remain relatively untapped, and how can corporates help? </p><p> Helge Muenkel: Despite the positive momentum described earlier, the financing gap for climate action in Asia remains daunting. </p><p> DBS estimates that over the next decade, the region will require approximately US$2.2 trillion for mitigation, US$2.5 trillion for adaptation, and a further 10 per cent of that total for resilience-related investments. In comparison, climate finance flows to South-east Asia from 2018 to 2019 totalled just US$27.8 billion annually. Even if this were to increase to US$50 billion annually, the shortfall over 10 years would still exceed US$4 trillion.</p><p> While the scale of capital needed is immense, it is not necessarily capital availability that is the issue -- rather, it is the lack of risk-adjusted returns that remain attractive enough to mobilise capital at scale. The priority must be on designing financing structures that shift the risk-return profile in favour of scalable investments. </p><p> This is where policy and regulatory frameworks become essential. Policymakers and regulators can create enabling environments through measures such as regulatory clarity on transition plans and incentives for green investments -- which can reduce uncertainty and improve the bankability of climate projects.</p><p> At the same time, financial innovation plays a pivotal role in unlocking new capital at a larger scale, such as concessionary and philanthropic capital. Structures like blended finance are particularly promising. They can de-risk early-stage projects, helping to crowd in commercial capital. For example, DBS inked a loan agreement alongside Karian Water Services, Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation. </p><p> The loan went towards the development of a regional water supply system to deliver fresh water to around two million people across Jakarta, Tangerang and South Tangerang, marking the first blended finance transaction in the water sector in Indonesia. </p><p> We are also seeing the potential of transition credits to support decarbonisation pathways in hard-to-abate sectors. DBS co-leads a working group under the Transition Credits Coalition convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It seeks to catalyse the creation of high-integrity, transition-related carbon credits. A core focus is to support the early and managed phaseout of thermal coal power across Asia, paving the way for credible, just-transition pathways -- particularly in industrial and emissions-intensive sectors.</p><p> Victor Wong: As both major asset holders and stakeholders in climate risk, insurers are well-positioned to play a dual role: investing in resilience infrastructure and integrating climate risks into underwriting and asset management. These areas remain relatively untapped, presenting a significant opportunity for impact.</p><p> Corporates also have a critical role to play. They can issue green and sustainability-linked bonds to fund climate-related activities, embed sustainability into procurement as corporates can stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services -- thereby indirectly channelling capital into green innovation -- and engage in transparent reporting aligned with international frameworks. These actions can help build investor confidence and attract ESG-focused capital. </p><p> A good example within Asean is Indonesia, where the funding gap for climate action is particularly prominent. To decarbonise its energy and transportation sectors, Indonesia requires an average investment of US$9.1 billion annually from 2018 to 2030. Under its national plan, the government allocated US$2.1 billion annually from 2020 to 2024, leaving a significant annual shortfall of US$7 billion. This highlights the potential of private financing in advancing climate action.</p><p> Corporates -- especially national banks in Indonesia -- can play a key role in mobilising private financing, as fossil fuels continue to receive a bigger share of private investment compared to renewable energy. </p><p> Mike Ng: There is ample liquidity in the system. Banks are still committed to financing green and transition projects and technologies. One often-cited problem lies in the bankability of such projects is the ability to generate enough cashflow to make it suitable for financing or to attract investors. </p><p> Central to the issue of bankability is risk allocation; allocating specific risks to the party most capable of managing and mitigating them is critical. For instance, in a utility project, having the project offtaker (often a state-owned utility company) take on regulatory risks or manage market demand risks by establishing long-term take-or-pay offtake agreements is one avenue for risk allocation. </p><p> Another problem contributing to the climate finance gap is the high cost of adoption. If the cost of a new green solution is several times that of a fossil fuel-based solution, it simply does not make economic sense for companies to adopt it. To overcome this, governments can consider implementing subsidies and regulations that lower the cost of adoption and stimulate demand in the process. When supply grows along with demand, the cost curves associated with the new technology come down. When the technology becomes economically viable, the financing gap naturally narrows. </p><p> Besides tapping traditional financing for climate finance, there are other funding mechanisms to consider. One is blended finance. Traditionally, blended finance structures have been deployed at the project level, with each individual project attracting capital from different providers including multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, export credit agencies, banks and others.</p><p>  As each project has its own risk profile and characteristics, deployment of blended finance at the project level tends to be bespoke and time-consuming, making scalability a challenge.</p><p> To achieve scalability, blended finance structures can be deployed at the fund level which combines capital from multiple stakeholders with different risk-return requirements but with common impact objectives into a single investment scheme. The fund in turn allocates capital to the individual projects. </p><p> Funds have the flexibility to accommodate different risk-return profiles and objectives in the choice of capital providers and fund structure, as well as distribution waterfalls in the fund's documentation. Such flexibility enables the \"crowding in\" of additional capital from commercial investors, achieving scalability to deliver outcomes in areas such as energy transition, climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation. </p><p> An example is the MAS' Financing Asia's Transition Partnership initiative, which aims to use an initial injection of US$500 million by the Singapore Government to raise funding from other sources up to a projected US$5 billion. </p><p> The goal is to finance green projects in Asia focused on accelerating the energy transition, ramping up green investments, and decarbonising emissions-intensive sectors such as cement and steel production.</p><p> Another benefit of blended finance is the blending of knowledge and expertise. The diversity of the participants brings a wealth of knowledge which can be shared. For example, multilateral agencies could advise on governance structures, engage local policymakers in enhancing bankability of project documentation, or provide training on ESG standards. Fund managers bring with them the expertise to evaluate project risks and returns, and to structure the fund to cater to the different investor profiles. </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods.

The next bound of The Ubin Project builds on the first tranche of projects that have been completed since 2014.</p><p>These updates were shared at Ubin Day 2025, which was graced by Guest-of-Honour Minister for Education and Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee. He was hosted by Minister of State for National Development Alvin Tan. To celebrate the occasion and in commemoration of SG60, they joined FUN members and the community to plant 60 trees at Jalan Jelutong earlier today.</p><p>Good progress for next bound of The Ubin Project<br/><br/>The next bound of The Ubin Project, which was launched last year, is a holistic and long-term plan that charts efforts to ensure that Pulau Ubin's natural and cultural heritage continues to be conserved in partnership with the community in the coming 10 years.</p><p>In 2021, NParks, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and FUN kickstarted discussions to chart the future direction of Pulau Ubin. Focus group discussions with FUN members were carried out from 2022 to 2023, where they shared their suggestions on developing the next bound of The Ubin Project for the next decade (2024 to 2034).</p><p>NParks has been working closely with FUN to implement the proposals, and good progress has been achieved across various pillars of The Ubin Project:</p><p>1. Biodiversity Conservation</p><p>Introduction of Cinnamon Bush Frog into Pulau Ubin</p><p>The Cinnamon Bush Frog is a nocturnal species that mainly lives in terrestrial forests and breeds in phytotelms . It was selected for NParks' Species Recovery Programme due to its Vulnerable status in the Singapore Red Data Book.</p><p>Previously, this native rainforest species was mostly confined to the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves and their surrounding Nature Parks. Following the successful introduction of the species into Singapore Botanic Gardens between 2017 and 2018, species recovery efforts for the Cinnamon Bush Frog were extended to Pulau Ubin.</p><p>Two batches of Cinnamon Bush Frog tadpoles, which were collected from the successfully translocated population from Singapore Botanic Gardens as well as the natural population from the Nature Reserves, have been introduced at two sites on the island where artificial phytotelm habitats were installed.</p><p>The first batch, which was introduced in June 2024, have matured into adult frogs and are living outside the artificial phytotelm habitats. This serves as an early indication that suggests Pulau Ubin may be a suitable habitat for this vulnerable species and that a population may be established outside of mainland Singapore. The second batch, which was introduced at another site on the island in March 2025, is still being monitored.</p><p>If the introduction of the Cinnamon Bush Frog into Pulau Ubin proves to be successful, this would expand its local distribution in Singapore and boost the chances of long-term survival for this vulnerable species.</p><p>Ongoing reforestation and habitat enhancement programmes</p><p>a. OneMillionTrees movement</p><p>As part of the Nature Conservation Masterplan, NParks has been carrying out reforestation efforts on Pulau Ubin, and has planted more than 20,000 trees on the island since 2020.</p><p>This year, more than 3,600 trees of over 145 native species will be planted progressively across 15 sites, including Chek Jawa Wetlands, Jalan Durian, Ketam Mountain Bike Park and Sensory Trail Pond, as part of reforestation efforts on Pulau Ubin. They include Critically Endangered species such as the Paku Raja (Cycas edentata), Bayur Jantan (Pterospermum diversifolium) and Mengkudu Laut (Timonius finlaysonianus).</p><p>Such reforestation efforts will help provide more sites for food and shelter for native biodiversity on Pulau Ubin such as the Greater Mousedeer (Tragulus napu), Mainland Leopard Cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), Sunda Pangolin (Manis javanica), as well as various species of pollinators such as birds, bats, bees and butterflies. At the same time, this will further the OneMillionTrees movement to plant one million more trees across Singapore and help enhance ecosystem resilience against the impacts of climate change in the longer term.</p><p>b. Shoreline restoration works</p><p>In line with NParks' broader efforts to harness nature-based solutions for enhancing coastal resilience, restoration works are currently underway to address ongoing erosion along Pulau Ubin's northern coastline and to prevent the loss of valuable coastal beach and mangrove habitats.</p><p>Preparation works are in progress to restore approximately 2.2 kilometres of the island's northern shoreline. As part of these efforts, headlands will be built near the coast to protect existing natural beach shorelines that are vulnerable to erosion and to encourage the accretion of sand over time. In addition, rock revetments will be installed beneath eroded mangrove undercuts to prevent further erosion and support the natural growth of mangroves along these structures.</p><p>2. Community, Heritage and History</p><p>FUN Workgroup for Kampung House Restoration</p><p>As part of efforts to revitalise kampung life on Pulau Ubin and retain its heritage and rustic kampung charm, NParks has been working with FUN and the community since 2017 to progressively restore kampung houses on the island.</p><p>For more information on NParks' initiatives to enhance liveability for Ubin's community, please refer to the Media Factsheet.</p><p>In 2024, NParks announced that it would develop a Kampung House Restoration Programme, which would kick off with the restoration of five non-residential houses for community and commercial use. To do so, NParks will be establishing the FUN Workgroup for Kampung House Restoration, which will comprise several FUN members as well as stakeholders from architecture and heritage-related fields.</p><p>NParks will work closely with the workgroup to explore the adaptive reuse of the restored kampung houses. The five kampung houses to be restored under the programme are: No. 6-J, No. 25, No. 27, No. 31 and No. 425-B.</p><p>Interested parties are invited to share proposals on how these kampung houses can be restored and used.</p><p>3. Education and Research</p><p>The Ubin School initiative was rolled out in 2024 to promote environmental education and stewardship among youths through multi-disciplinary programming and experiential learning. The initiative's programmes incorporate projects under The Ubin Project, involve the Pulau Ubin community, and celebrate the island's rich natural and cultural heritage.</p><p>Tapping on citizen science for habitat enhancement efforts<br/><br/>To transform Pulau Ubin into a learning classroom set in nature, the Ubin School initiative is tapping on citizen science to support habitat enhancement efforts for Pulau Ubin. For example, in 2024 and 2025, students from Meridian Secondary School contributed to the monitoring of reforestation sites on the island by tagging the planted trees and measuring their height and girth, supporting long-term ecological data collection.</p><p>To foster greater student involvement in environmental stewardship, these efforts will also be extended to more schools such as Anchor Green Primary School and Raffles Girls' School this year. This will also complement other ongoing habitat enhancement efforts with students, such as coastal clean-ups and invasive species management.</p><p>Experiential learning through interactions with Ubin villagers</p><p>Several learning journeys conducted this year have involved members of the Pulau Ubin community. For instance, as part of their learning journey on the changing landscapes of Pulau Ubin and the relationship between the island and its villagers, students from North Vista Secondary School's Outdoor Activities Club visited a kampung house and interacted with a villager to understand the Ubin way of life. During their visit, students learnt about the cultivation of fruit trees and medicinal herbs and had the opportunity to experience drawing water from traditional wells.</p><p>Similarly, as part of Commonwealth Secondary Schools STEM Elective, which aims to nurture scientific thinking and environmental stewardship, Secondary 3 and 4 students observed the daily routines and eco-friendly practices of the island's villagers.</p><p>Furthermore, schools are encouraged to cater meals from the island's eateries, with additional time allocated for meals to allow students to visit shops and interact with villagers at the Main Village and form deeper connections with the island and its community.</p><p>Ubin as an outdoor classroom</p><p>To further position Pulau Ubin as an outdoor classroom for experiential learning, NParks has extended the Ubin School initiative to include biology student teachers from the National Institute of Education (NIE).</p><p>A pilot cohort of biology student teachers participated in the Ubin School initiative in 2024, with a second batch taking part earlier this year. Through the initiative, these student teachers are given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the logistical and pedagogical aspects of planning and conducting educational activities on Pulau Ubin to deepen students' understanding of the island's rich biodiversity, heritage and culture.</p><p>4. Nature-based Recreation</p><p>Upgrading and enhancing amenities on Pulau Ubin</p><p>NParks has completed trail improvement works on the earth tracks leading up to Puaka Hill and to Chek Jawa Wetlands from Jalan Durian, enhancing the visitor experience for those on foot or bicycles. In addition, NParks worked closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to repave roads and carry out rehabilitation works on Pulau Ubin's bridges.</p><p>To alleviate flooding during high spring tide periods, a new drain was created at the back of the Main Village earlier this year to divert rainwater away from the low-lying kampung houses. The drain beside the Wayang Stage has also been widened, improving drainage flow to the sea.</p><p>NParks will continue to work with FUN to provide and enhance amenities on Pulau Ubin, while ensuring they are in harmony with the island's natural environment. This includes ongoing efforts to upgrade and enhance interpretive displays and signage to improve wayfinding for visitors.</p><p>Shaping the future of Ubin with the community</p><p>Under the next bound of The Ubin Project, NParks has been working with FUN to engage stakeholders on charting the future direction of Pulau Ubin. To date, most villagers have been engaged through interviews to seek their views and ideas. Their feedback reflects broad support for enhancing Pulau Ubin's attractiveness while conserving its cultural heritage and natural environment.</p><p>In 2024, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) also presented the plans for the next bound of The Ubin Project as part of their Recreation Master Plan roving exhibition, to seek the public's suggestions. These suggestions will be taken into consideration as the plans for Pulau Ubin are developed.</p><p>As Singapore transforms into a City in Nature, NParks will continue to build on the first tranche of The Ubin Project and work closely with FUN to engage stakeholders on how to best preserve Pulau Ubin's rustic charm and heritage, natural environment and biodiversity for future generations.</p><p>Ubin Day 2025</p><p>Ubin Day is a culmination of Pesta Ubin, a festival organised by NParks, FUN members and the community. First held in 2002, this is the 14th edition of Ubin Day, celebrating the different facets of the island. During the two-week-long Pesta Ubin this year, close to 1,000 participants took part in over 40 activities on Pulau Ubin. Participants learnt more about Pulau Ubin's rich biodiversity and natural history through themed guided walks for photography and birdwatching, kampung heritage tours, cycling tours, mangrove kayaking and more.

However, the pollutants going into the river have continued to outpace clean-up efforts, noted environmentalists. </p><p> \"The cleanliness drive is also to ensure wider awareness so that people don't throw waste into the river. We want river waters to be clean,\" said Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani.</p><p> But it is not just the discarded rubbish that is the problem.</p><p> A report released recently by Toxics Link, an Indian environmental research and advocacy organisation, said high levels of nonylphenol -- a chemical with carcinogenic properties that can cause prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women -- were detected in the surface water of four rivers including the Sabarmati, downstream of the riverfront project. </p><p> The chemical, which also kills aquatic life, is used in the textile industry in particular. </p><p> \"It is not enough to keep the riverfront water clean and not the rest of the stretch,\" said Mr Mahesh Pandya, director of Paryavaran Mitra, a Gujarat-based non-governmental organisation dedicated to protecting the environment. </p><p> In September 2024, the Gujarat High Court rebuked the local authorities for failing to come up with a concrete plan for cleaning up the river. The court initiated public interest litigation on its own and has kept a close scrutiny over the clean-up efforts. \"All your claims are on paper,\" the court noted, according to a report in the Gujarat Samachar newspaper.</p><p> Contamination from untreated sewage is a common problem for India's rivers.</p><p> According to some estimates, 38,000 million litres of wastewater enter Indian rivers due to the lack of functioning sewage treatment plants and poor waste disposal.</p><p> Many riverfront projects in the pipelinePolluted rivers present a jarring challenge to local governments' plans to spruce up riverfronts and turn them into attractive urban community spaces.</p><p> A report by the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) said 61 riverfront projects have been initiated under the Smart Cities Mission, an urban renewal and retrofitting programme by the government to improve facilities and infrastructure in Indian cities. Many more are being developed outside the mission. </p><p> Along the Sabarmati, the first 11.25km of the riverfront development, completed in 2012, has been held up as an exemplary instance of riverfront development in India.</p><p> Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, hosted world leaders like Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014 and the late former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2017 at the riverfront.</p><p> Surbana Jurong, which has joined the further development of the riverfront, aims to foster \"a vibrant and engaging urban-river interface\", said Mr Malhotra. </p><p> He said the masterplan \"embraces the natural slope of the riverbanks to create a convenient transition from the street level to the lower terrace, enhancing the connection between riverfront and the surrounding urban fabric\".</p><p> The firm would be using a \"blend of design strategies -- from landscaped stepped terraces to natural, soft edges\", he added, allowing \"inclusive public access for people of all abilities\". </p><p> The Gujarat government is also proposing to build a Singapore-style Cloud Forest -- a greenhouse-like structure with exotic trees and plants under a dome -- covering an area of over 2,500 sq m, which is smaller than a football field.</p><p> The trend to develop riverfronts in India is part of a larger push to boost urban infrastructure and make cities liveable. </p><p> A study on waterfront development projects by the SPA, a public higher education institution, noted that such projects are significant as cities are \"grappling with multiple issues of pollution, biodiversity loss and extreme pressure on open spaces\". </p><p> It added that these developments lead to \"an increase in available and usable open spaces, re-establishing the lost connection between the people and the water body, an increase in livelihood options and property prices\". </p><p> The SPA study noted that the development of the Ganga riverfront in the eastern city of Patna in Bihar state had led to significantly enhanced recreational facilities, improved public transport connectivity, and addressed waste management issues. </p><p> It further noted that anecdotal evidence suggested a potential increase in property values and economic activity. </p><p> Clean up rivers before developing riverfronts In some cities, residents are putting pressure on the authorities to pay as much attention to environmental concerns as developing the riverfront.</p><p> Angry citizens of Pune, a city in the western state of Maharashtra, have staged protest marches, filed lawsuits and planted trees to demand that the Mula River be cleaned up and that riverfront developments take environmental concerns into account.</p><p> A concrete-heavy riverside development would affect the natural aqueducts that charge the groundwater and the biodiversity along the river, said Pune-based environmentalist Mukund Mavalankar. </p><p> \"We have pointed out that the river is dying because of untreated sewage going into the river. This needs to be tackled first,\" said Mr Mavalankar. </p><p> The capacity of sewage treatment plants along the Mula River is 500 million litres per day, when the required capacity is 1,000 million litres, he added.</p><p> While the protests and legal cases have not stalled plans as yet, they have brought focus on the issue of rejuvenating rivers and ensuring that wanton construction does not take place along their banks.</p><p> A key problem has also been the lack of a holistic approach to cleaning rivers that flow through multiple states, water experts noted, arguing that piecemeal efforts are often unsuccessful despite the best intentions. </p><p> Ms Jaya Dhindaw, the executive programme director of Sustainable Cities at WRI India, an independent research organisation, said important initiatives and institutional mechanisms have been set up by the government, like the National Mission for Clean Ganga to clean the river Ganga and the surrounding areas.</p><p> The Ganga is a 2,525km-long river that crosses multiple states in India before flowing into Bangladesh.</p><p> She said: \"A data-led approach which helps identify the sources of pollution, strong enforcement of pollution control, integrating nature-based solutions to manage water quality, and enabling community ownership and stewardship of rivers are essential to the long-term success of clean-up efforts.\"</p><p> Test case in DelhiA test case for whether river rejuvenation can happen with riverfront development is in the capital city.</p><p> The Delhi government, which like Gujarat's is led by Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, has promised a Sabarmati-type riverfront makeover along the Yamuna River.</p><p> Plans include creating a central piazza, topiary park, shopping centre and river promenade along a 22km stretch of the river.</p><p> The Yamuna flows through multiple states, with the stretch in Delhi among its most polluted.

In doing so, emissions from the impending deforestation are prevented from being released, and are sold as carbon credits. </p><p> Each credit represents one tonne of planet-warming emissions that is prevented from being released into the atmosphere, and buyers are companies who want to offset their carbon footprint.  </p><p> There are about 4.7 million ha of mangroves in South-east Asia, but only 2.1 million ha can be protected as carbon projects as they are at risk of being cut down.</p><p>  A forest that is not threatened cannot supply carbon credits to the carbon market. </p><p> If a forest does not face a deforestation threat, issuing credits for its conservation is not considered \"additional\", and is akin to paying for an outcome that would have happened anyway. This concept of additionality is used to assess the quality of a carbon project. </p><p> For the analysis, the researchers used a base price of US$29.72 (S$40) per mangrove carbon credit. This was the selling price in June 2023 for carbon credits from  a mangrove protection project in Pakistan.</p><p> A higher carbon price could help to lower the risk of mangroves being converted for production, said the researchers, although the study did not attempt to calculate a price floor. </p><p> Other approaches, including ensuring that local communities have alternative livelihoods, could also help to lower the risk of land conversion for socio-economic reasons, the researchers added. </p><p> Assistant Professor Zeng Yiwen from NTU's Asian School of the Environment, who supervised the study, said local communities should receive benefits fairly and equitably from the establishment and running of a carbon credit project. </p><p> \"If projects can incorporate mechanisms for benefit sharing with local stakeholders, some of the socio-economic permanence risks can be mitigated,\" said Prof Zeng. \"This can help to increase the project's ability to provide long-term biodiversity and climate benefits.\" </p><p> The study was published on Jan 28 in the journal Communications Earth And Environment. </p><p> It spotlights a critical issue in global discussions on protecting nature -- the \"permanence\" of nature-based solutions, or how securely ecosystems can store carbon for the long term without the risk of it being released back into the atmosphere.</p><p> Nature-based solutions refer to efforts to protect natural habitats so their carbon-sucking abilities can be tapped in humanity's fight against climate change.</p><p> But many factors could affect the permanence of a nature-based carbon project, where the stored carbon in the ecosystem does not remain sequestered indefinitely. </p><p> Besides land clearance, other factors that could affect permanence include climate change impacts over the longer term -- 75 to 100 years.</p><p> For the study, the researchers also looked into how rising sea levels and tropical cyclones could threaten the permanence of mangroves -- coastal ecosystems that exist where land meets sea -- in South-east Asia.  </p><p> Previous studies have shown that tropical cyclones rated Category 3 and above can cause mangrove forest structure damage, said Ms Kwan. </p><p> Climate scientists have predicted that climate change and warming oceans will fuel more intense cyclones. </p><p> Mangroves have a unique ability to keep pace with sea level rise, since their tangled webs of roots allow them to trap sediment. But Ms Kwan said this ability hinges on there being adequate sediment brought in by the tides.  </p><p> She noted that an earlier study had found that sediment delivery at almost 70 per cent of study sites within the Indo-Pacific was inadequate for supporting high rates of sediment accretion, due to dams and other human activities. </p><p> At these sites, the rate of sea level rise will likely be faster than soil surface elevation gain in mangroves, compromising the permanence of these ecosystems, she said.</p><p> The study recommended that mangrove carbon projects factor in future climate impacts by allowing mangroves to migrate inland -- a process that can happen naturally, as long as there are no infrastructural projects blocking their landward path. </p><p> Overall, the study found that 1.8 million ha -- or 85 per cent of mangrove areas that are considered \"investible\" as mangrove carbon projects -- are likely to experience some form of permanence risk from both socio-economic and climate factors. </p><p> Prof Zeng said: \"Our study suggests that socio-economic and climate change permanence risks to blue carbon projects can be potentially extensive, and that some areas could experience greater risk than others.\" </p><p> Blue carbon refers to carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems, including mangroves. </p><p> Prof Zeng said the loss of mangroves in a carbon project will not only impact a carbon project developer's profitability, but will also compromise the services that nature provides to people and biodiversity -- such as by removing carbon from the atmosphere or providing habitat for wildlife. </p><p> \"Addressing the risks to a mangrove's permanence can help to improve the likelihood of a project remaining conserved in the long term,\" he said. </p><p> \"Ultimately, this will impact the benefits to local communities and biodiversity, which tends to require the long-term persistence of these natural ecosystems.\" </p><p> Ms Hoon Ling Min, investment director at Temasek-backed investment platform company GenZero, which invests in decarbonisation solutions including nature-based ones, said permanence is a critical factor in assessing carbon projects. </p><p> Other factors -- including additionality and leakage considerations -- are also taken into account, she added.

It is also an important driver of financial and environmental dividends. </p><p> While the economic benefits of employing women are well documented, the environmental angle is often overlooked, despite evidence of the value women bring to climate agendas and conservation projects. Climate change is rarely considered when we consider the need for greater gender equality. </p><p> We should draw a tighter connection between empowering women and addressing climate change.  </p><p> Consider the evidenceGreater female representation correlates with superior environmental performance -- at the country, corporate and household levels.</p><p> Scientists have documented a statistically significant association between female parliamentary representation and the stringency of a country's climate policies. Countries with a higher proportion of women in Parliament are more likely to ratify environmental treaties and implement policies aimed at addressing climate change, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p> At a corporate level, companies whose boards included at least three women directors for at least three years achieved greater reductions in carbon-emissions intensity versus their peers in the same sector. </p><p> Such companies were also more likely (16 per cent versus 6.3 per cent) to have environmental targets linked to executive compensation, according to research by investment research firm Morgan Stanley Capital International.</p><p> A 2018 study by Yale University in the US also showed that women are more likely to be concerned about the climate crisis than men. In developed economies, women drive 70 per cent to 80 per cent of all consumer purchasing decisions, and are leading the transition to more sustainable lifestyles. </p><p> Women are more likely to recycle, minimise waste, and save water and energy in the household.  </p><p> This care for our planet has deep roots. </p><p> In rural and indigenous communities, women have played a traditional role as managers and stewards of natural resources and agricultural systems for generations. One study demonstrated that women hold greater plant knowledge than men and, more importantly, share this knowledge more widely, with horizontal knowledge transmission measured at 73 per cent for women and 61 per cent for men.  </p><p> That expertise and sharing of knowledge improves conservation on the ground, as demonstrated by the success of women-only forest protection groups, shown in multiple studies done in India. </p><p> For example, a study in India in 2006 showed that female participation in forest management is associated with a 24 per cent increase in the probability of controlling illicit grazing, a 28 per cent increase in the probability of controlling illicit felling, and a 28 per cent increase in the probability of forest regeneration. </p><p> The evidence is compelling: When women are empowered in environmental projects, their deep knowledge of local ecosystems and resource management practices, as well as their centrality to community dynamics, leads to a substantial increase in the efficacy of such projects. </p><p> This is an important factor to note for investors into nature-based solutions that protect, restore and manage natural ecosystems with the aim of mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing biodiversity. </p><p> Combining gender goals with nature-based solutions serves a dual purpose: It improves environmental outcomes while ensuring that women are allowed to fairly access and benefit from natural resources.</p><p> The emergence of  new solutionsWe are beginning to see nature-focused investors take this connection seriously. </p><p> The Kiwa Initiative in the Pacific Islands, for example, integrates gender equality into land restoration projects. It not only revitalises degraded landscapes, but also elevates women into leadership roles traditionally dominated by men.</p><p> In Nepal, a ground-breaking initiative has put women at the helm of managing the country's vast forests. This shift has led to more sustainable forestry practices, reduced deforestation and improved community livelihoods. </p><p> In Tajikistan, a women-led snow leopard conservation project has integrated species preservation with female empowerment, creating jobs and ecotourism revenues while protecting biodiversity. </p><p> Integrating gender considerations into nature investments requires deliberate strategies and innovative financial instruments. Investors now have a wider suite of investment structures to consider, from green bonds with gender criteria to investment funds prioritising female-led sustainability projects. </p><p> The Climate Bonds Initiative, a non-profit organisation working to mobilise global capital for climate action, and UN Women are partnering on new guidance to integrate gender considerations within green finance tools promoting climate resilience. </p><p> Remember the bottom lineDespite the environmental dividends, mainstreaming gender equality within sustainable finance will require continued education on the financial benefits of empowering women. </p><p> We must remember that companies with more women in senior management score higher in all dimensions of organisational performance. At a global level, a White House report published during US President Donald Trump's first term in February 2020 estimated that the value of removing legal restrictions on women globally could boost global gross domestic product by US$7.7 trillion (S$10.4 trillion), or 8.3 per cent.  </p><p> Limited data, entrenched biases and policy gaps impede progress. However, these challenges also highlight the vast potential for growth. The UN estimates that US$360 billion a year is needed to bridge the gender gap. With the promise of a US$7.7 trillion payoff, that looks like a bargain.  </p><p> It is a collective responsibility to drive gender equality, given the shared benefits that accrue to all. </p><p> Business leaders and decision-makers in all industries can take action by developing programmes and earmarking funds to promote inclusive policies and prioritise gender diversity at all levels of their organisations. </p><p> Adopting a gender-lens approach is not about being woke -- it is an economically and environmentally astute move. Doing more to connect gender equality and sustainable development will help unlock additional benefits for all. </p><p> Let us shift the narrative from \"why\" we should invest in women to how quickly we can scale these investments.

The problem is less a shortage of money than a shortage of projects that are both sustainable and bankable.</p><p> The growing -- if largely still voluntary -- market for carbon credits, driven by governments and companies like HSBC which have made fixed pledges to transition to carbon-neutral operations, is an encouraging development. These range from Gabon's recent offering of 90 million tonnes of sovereign carbon credits; to Norway's new agreement to pay Indonesia to preserve forests under the United Nation's REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) scheme; to more ambitious debt-for-nature swaps where creditors forgive debt in return for undertakings to preserve or expand natural assets.</p><p> But all these schemes have struggled with definitional loopholes and enforcement issues. Climate-related agreements and financial instruments are still evolving, and there is no generally agreed consensus on terms or terminology.

To be fair, the issues are complex. If a company is raising money to build a new factory and is promising to compensate for its carbon output by planting trees, is it going to plant millions of the same species and are those species native or not, either of which would be detrimental to biodiversity? What are they going to replace? Where is the water going to come from'</p><p> The market is hungry for green financial products, many of which will have nature-based components, but until asset managers have the confidence that the funding will be used sustainably, they will be reluctant to commit at anything close to the scale we need to contain and reverse climate change.</p><p> Clear taxonomies also hold the potential to unleash the power of central banks.

Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat launched the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Draft Master Plan 2025 (DMP2025) Exhibition this morning - a showcase of Singapore's land use development blueprint for the next 10 to 15 years. The DMP2025 is shaped through URA's most extensive public engagement exercise to date. As Singapore celebrates 60 years of independence (SG60), DMP2025 presents a milestone in our development as a city-state. It is an opportunity to reflect on our shared journey as a nation and collective citizenship in overcoming challenges and shaping a future together.</p><p>2. The DMP2025 showcases islandwide land use plans and strategies for more inclusive, accessible homes and neighbourhoods; refreshed business nodes and vibrant workspaces; and a more resilient Singapore that is better able to respond to economic, social and climate challenges in the years to come. Together, these proposals aim to create a more liveable, inclusive and endearing Singapore, by offering Singaporeans from all walks of life with more choices for living, working and leisure, as well as a deepened sense of identity and place.</p><p>3. Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer, URA, said \"Over the past two years, we have engaged Singaporeans and communities across generations and backgrounds to better understand their aspirations. Their feedback has helped to shape a more holistic plan that reflects the priorities and concerns of our people, while addressing key challenges such as climate change and an ageing population.

URA will continue working closely with the community to ensure that the Master Plan remains a living blueprint, rooted in our shared values and responsive to Singapore's evolving needs.\"</p><p>Building our future, together</p><p>4. Singapore's long-term and integrated planning approach is underpinned by two key frameworks: the Long-Term Plan, which sets strategic directions for the next 50 years and beyond; and the Master Plan, reviewed every five years, which translates these strategies into detailed land use proposals. The DMP2025 builds on the strategies developed in the last Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) in 2022, translating them into detailed land use plans that will guide Singapore's physical transformation over the next 10 to 15 years.</p><p>5. Since October 2023, URA has engaged almost 220,000 people for their feedback on development plans of varying scales in the DMP2025, shaped around four themes: (i) Shaping A Happy Healthy City; (ii) Enabling Sustainable Growth; (iii) Strengthening Urban Resilience and; (iv) Stewarding Nature and Heritage. Through multiple platforms, including exhibitions, dialogues, focus group discussions and surveys, URA carried out its most extensive public engagement effort to date, to ensure that the DMP2025 balances diverse priorities at the national, community and individual levels.</p><p>6.

The DMP2025 presents plans for a more vibrant and inclusive city where everyone can have better access to essential services, lead more active lifestyles and move around with ease. A variety of housing options will be introduced islandwide to cater to different needs, ages and backgrounds. They will enable more Singaporeans to benefit from convenient access to transport connectivity and a good range of amenities. At the same time, the DMP2025 plans will also create endearing neighbourhoods with lively public spaces, pedestrianised streets and cycling connections that support social bonding, ageing-in-place, wellness and active lifestyles. Each neighbourhood will also be shaped with a distinctive identity to anchor residents' sense of place.</p><p>8.  In addition to the plans for new neighbourhoods in more central locations at Pearl's Hill, Marina South, Bukit Timah Turf City, the former Keppel Golf Course site and Mount Pleasant that URA showcased at the 'My City, My Home' exhibition in November 2023, the DMP2025 outlines plans for more new homes and neighbourhoods across the island.</p><p>New neighbourhoods for every need and lifestyle</p><p>9. A mix of public and private homes, along with amenities will be introduced at Dover-Medway along Dover Road in the Greater one-north area. The new Dover-Medway neighbourhood will support residents who wish to stay close to work and learning spaces in the knowledge hub. It is home to leading technology, media and biomedical firms and Institutes of Higher Learning.</p><p>10. Up in the north at Kranji, the site occupied by the former Singapore Racecourse will be redeveloped into a new housing estate that capitalises on its rustic surroundings to blend recreation and leisure attractions with daily living. After the relocation of existing uses from 2028, the Sembawang Shipyard area will be progressively transformed into a distinctive mixed-use waterfront district where the design of the future housing estate will take into consideration the area's coastal and maritime character.</p><p>11. Following the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base from the 2030s onwards, the site and its surrounding areas will gradually undergo a major transformation into a community-centric and future-ready town. It will feature an extensive network of green and blue spaces, well-connected mobility options and a distinct aviation character.</p><p>12. The development of the new neighbourhoods will be paced out, to allow for flexibility to review and adjust plans regularly in tandem with evolving needs and trends. At the same time, existing towns such as Pasir Ris and Yishun will also be rejuvenated with new homes and amenities, adding to the range of housing options for different preferences and needs.</p><p>13. There will also be more opportunities to live in and near the city centre, with a new Newton neighbourhood planned next to the Newton MRT station. Comprising three clusters at Newton Circus, Scotts Road and Monk's Hill, the neighbourhood will be shaped as a vibrant mixed-use 'urban village' with new homes set amidst greenery. At the doorsteps of Orchard Road, the new Paterson neighbourhood will be transformed into a bustling mixed-use hub with new residential developments, shops and public spaces.</p><p>14.In addition to planning for inclusive homes and neighbourhoods that cater to residents of all ages and abilities, we will provide more assisted living options and active ageing centres, to support seniors in ageing actively and independently across more neighbourhoods. This includes Community Care Apartments (CCA), which is a public assisted living typology jointly developed by MND, MOH and HDB, that pairs senior-friendly housing with on-site social activities and care services. Private assisted living apartments such as the upcoming Parry Avenue project will also present other options for senior-friendly homes with care services and wellness amenities.</p><p>Bringing recreation and amenities closer to all</p><p>15. Planning for recreational spaces to support residents' well-being and a good quality living environment has always been a priority. At the roving exhibitions for the Recreation Master Plan from April to September 2024, URA received feedback from more than 66,000 people on their recreational aspirations. In response to feedback for more affordable and inclusive recreational options near homes as well as spaces that support wellness and active lifestyles, URA will plan for better access to recreational spaces and amenities such as sports facilities, retail and community spaces, in addition to every household being a 10-minute walk from a park.</p><p>16. The DMP2025 provides for new integrated community hubs in several towns, including proposed hubs in Woodlands, Yio Chu Kang and Sengkang. Conveniently located near transport nodes, these integrated community hubs will bring together sports, recreational, healthcare and retail facilities under one roof to better serve residents' needs. Residents can also look forward to six new Sport-In-Precinct (SIP) projects islandwide that are currently being built in Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong, Ulu Pandan, Whampoa, Tampines North and Pasir Ris East, with more being studied by agencies.</p><p>17. Besides integrating recreational facilities into new neighbourhoods, we are working with agencies to activate underutilised areas such as spaces below MRT viaducts and the rooftops of HDB multi-storey car parks for social and recreational activities. Examples include the Bukit Gombak MRT viaduct that has been turned into a space for community art installation, and an upcoming SIP facility atop the multi-storey car park of 19A Dover Crescent.</p><p>More efficient, greener journeys</p><p>18. Singapore is on track to have 8 in 10 households be within a 10-minute walk from a train station by the 2030s, as part of the national objective to enhance connectivity while reducing car dependency. Additionally, our cycling network will be expanded to around 1,300km by 2030 to encourage healthier and greener journeys. In support of the goal of shaping Singapore as a more connected city for walking and cycling, the DMP2025 showcases plans for a new pedestrian bridge connecting Marina Centre and Bay East Garden, providing pedestrians and cyclists with a more direct connection between the city and the East Coast along the Round Island Route by 2029.</p><p>19.

URA's decentralisation strategy aims at sustaining a competitive and open economy for Singapore while creating vibrant workspaces and opportunities across the island for Singaporeans to thrive. Since decentralisation commenced in the early-1990s, we have progressively established a hierarchy of economic gateways and business nodes islandwide, bringing jobs and amenities closer to homes, while spreading transport flows and reducing the need to travel to the city centre. The focus of the DMP2025 is to continue driving Singapore's economic growth by strengthening our economic gateways and business nodes, rejuvenating key precincts, and supporting innovation.</p><p>21. The Northern, Eastern and Western Gateways will continue to grow as important economic hubs. Upcoming developments in Woodlands Regional Centre will capitalise on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and upcoming Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link, which is targeted to be ready by end-2026. The opening of Changi Airport Terminal 5 in the mid-2030s will reinforce Singapore's position as a global aviation hub, the PSA Supply Chain Hub and Tuas Port, scheduled to be completed in 2027 and 2040s respectively, will enhance Singapore's logistics capabilities and port capacity.</p><p>22. Agencies will embark on plans to redevelop Town Centres to support decentralisation efforts. Bishan Sub-Regional Centre for example, will undergo rejuvenation with the introduction of new workplaces, amenities, and pedestrian-friendly streets. Agencies are studying the potential of transforming Bishan Place into a landscaped pedestrian mall as well as plans for a new polyclinic and potential hawker centre that could be integrated with an upgraded bus interchange. In addition, a few government agencies are currently exploring the feasibility of relocating their offices here to jumpstart the development of this business node.</p><p>Revitalising our city centre</p><p>23. Our city centre remains a vital destination for business, tourism and culture, anchoring Singapore's status as a global hub. Rejuvenation plans are underway for our Orchard and Downtown areas. This includes plans to create a new destination park in the heart of the city by merging Istana Park and Dhoby Ghaut Green with a 500-metre stretch of Orchard Road. In addition, an elevated pedestrian link bridge between Dhoby Ghaut Green and Fort Canning Park is also being planned. When implemented, these enhancements will create a refreshed and well-connected green space offering visitors a family-friendly area to gather in the city centre.</p><p>24. Over at Marina Bay, new attractions will be introduced to boost our city's capacity to host international events in a vibrant environment for locals, businesses and leisure travellers alike. This includes a planned wellness destination and recreational spaces in the bay such as NS Square and PAssion Wave Outpost @ Bayfront, as well as the expansion of Marina Bay Sands. These efforts will further enhance Marina Bay as an inclusive and welcoming destination.</p><p>25.

As part of efforts to involve the public in shaping vibrant and endearing workspaces for the future, JTC and URA launched the \"Reimagining Former Jurong Bird Park and Jurong Hill\" ideas competition in October 2024 to seek innovative ideas that reimagine the site for both work and play. The DMP2025 has unveiled the winners of the ideas competition, who envisioned the area as a mixed-use precinct that blends work and leisure and is anchored by the site's unique terrain and industrial identity. This complements the proposed conservation of Jurong Hill Tower, as a symbol of Singapore's industrial transformation since independence. Agencies will distil suitable ideas and concepts into planning and design principles to guide the site's future redevelopment and uses.</p><p>27.

The DMP2025 outlines strategies to address the impact of climate change, such as rising temperatures and sea level rise, and presents further efforts in optimising land use both above and below ground. These initiatives will continue to be expanded and refined to ensure that Singapore remains liveable and adaptable in the face of future challenges, alongside ongoing efforts to redevelop the city in response to the changing needs of our people.</p><p>Leveraging technology to protect against climate change</p><p>29. With Singapore's mean temperature projected to rise significantly by 2100 due to climate change, efforts are underway to design a cooler and more comfortable urban environment, even as we continue to develop. Environmental modelling tools are being developed in collaboration with local universities to facilitate more data-driven and scenario-based urban planning. These include digital technology to simulate wind and heat conditions, helping us create more climate-sensitive urban design, which contribute towards a more comfortable environment for precincts.</p><p>Progressing with plans for 'Long Island'</p><p>30. With rising sea levels posing a critical threat, Singapore is advancing plans for 'Long Island' - an integrated solution along the East Coast that will meet multiple national objectives. Beyond coastal protection, water and flood resilience, 'Long Island' will create land for future needs and recreational opportunities. Over 3,000 members of the public and stakeholders have contributed their ideas and feedback for this long-term project, and technical studies are currently ongoing to explore potential engineering and nature-based solutions that could be introduced, amongst others.</p><p>Exploring further possibilities for underground space</p><p>31. We will continue to tap on our underground space to free up valuable surface space for people and build robust infrastructure to support long-term growth. Significant progress has already been made over the past few decades, with underground infrastructure such as MRT tunnels, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System and Jurong Rock Caverns helping to free up valuable surface land, while supporting the development of infrastructure.</p><p>32.As part of the DMP2025, we will expand the strategic use of underground space, including exploring deep caverns at sites like Gali Batu for storage of construction aggregate, while identifying more possibilities for new underground developments through research and capability-building to enhance technical expertise in this field.</p><p>33. See Annex E [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32e.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32e.pdf</url>] for more details of the initiatives under 'Strengthen Urban Resilience'</p><p>(IV) Stewarding Nature and Heritage: Anchoring our sense of belonging and enhancing our natural capital</p><p>34. Striking a balance between social, economic and environmental considerations remains a key tenet of the DMP2025. Beyond enhancing our heritage spaces, we will leverage innovative approaches to ensure that Singapore continues to develop sensitively as a City in Nature.</p><p>A greener city</p><p>35. Our vision towards becoming a City in Nature has progressed steadily. Since 2021, 130 ha of new parks have been added and our Park Connector Network has grown to about 390km. Over the next five years, we will target to implement more than 25 new parks and over 50km of park connectors. The upcoming Kranji Nature Corridor for instance, will strengthen ecological connectivity in the northern region of the island between the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and provide new nature-based recreation opportunities for all.</p><p>36.

Building on the Heritage &amp; Identity Plan conceptualised in the last LTPR, URA has engaged stakeholders over the past year to develop a new thematic narrative framework covering key pillars of Singapore's history and development as an independent nation: Economy, Housing, Social and Defence. The framework aims to illustrate the roles that our built heritage plays in charting Singapore's more recent history, and guides strategies to recall heritage as Singapore continues to develop, whether through adaptive reuse of selected buildings, or enhancing the characters of areas through sensitive urban design and placemaking initiatives. Agencies will continue to review the feasibility of adapting these buildings for new uses to serve our needs as well as integrate them with future developments to make them more accessible to the public.</p><p>38. In addition to the five sites and buildings1 which were announced in May 2025 to be proposed for conservation as part of the DMP2025, URA has further proposed conserving the NatSteel Steel Pavilion, the former Pasir Panjang English School as well as selected buildings at Bukit Timah Turf City.</p><p>39. See Annex G [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32g.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32g.pdf</url>] for more details of the new thematic narrative framework and buildings proposed for conservation.</p><p>40. Apart from conservation, we will also pursue other ways of recalling heritage to strengthen our sense of identity. URA has engaged over 2,300 residents and stakeholders to co-create proposals to enhance the three Identity Corridors2 of Historic East, Kallang River and Inner Ring.</p><p>41. Following public and communities' feedback and ideas, URA has identified three new identity nodes at Siglap, Moonstone Lane Estate, and Newton. They add to the 18 existing identity nodes which URA previously identified based on their distinctive local character and identity and progressively enhanced over the years. The extensive public consultations have also led to plans to enliven the Identity Corridors with more inclusive spaces, including a new pedestrian mall at Katong and new parks along Kallang River, such as at the Moonstone-Bendemeer and Potong Pasir-St Andrew's areas.</p><p>42. See Annex H [PDF, 153kb] for more details of the Identity Corridors and upcoming initiatives.</p><p>Be part of the DMP2025: Peek into the plans for tomorrow and visit the islandwide DMP2025 Exhibition</p><p>43.

Even then, it covers only industrial facilities with direct greenhouse gas emissions of at least 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year. </p><p> This means that the majority of companies in Singapore have no incentive to purchase credits, except out of their climate commitments. </p><p> Banks themselves are also cautious about financing the development of carbon projects, given the reputational and liquidity risks to which they could be exposed. </p><p> Developers need to first show that their projects are of high quality, transparent and verifiable before banks will step in and act as an intermediary, said Anton Ruddenklau, partner and head of financial services at KPMG in Singapore.</p><p> \"Banks only want to be involved in projects that have got really strong governance, risk and control management.

In the pact with Bhutan, for example, the 5 per cent will go to the country's heat management measures and climate-resilient agriculture. </p><p> There are two main types of carbon credits -- nature-based ones and technological ones, such as switching from pollutive firewood to cleaner cookstoves. Nature-based credits could come from projects such as forest restoration and conservation, as well as sustainable agriculture.</p><p> News of the signing of the implementation agreement between Singapore and Peru comes as the Republic looks to buy its first set of nature-based carbon offsets to meet its 2030 climate change target. </p><p> The Government had in September 2024 called on carbon project developers and credit suppliers to propose nature-based projects that can deliver at least 500,000 credits each. </p><p> This request for proposal drew 17 submissions before it closed in mid-February. It is not immediately clear whether any of the submissions included proposals to purchase carbon credits from projects in Peru. </p><p> Of the three other implementation agreements that Singapore has, most progress has been made with Ghana. </p><p> In September 2024, Singapore and Ghana called for project developers to submit applications for their carbon credit projects in Ghana to be authorised. These applications are now being assessed. </p><p> A Singapore Government spokesperson told The Straits Times that some possible project types that may be authorised in Ghana are related to clean water supply and clean cooking. </p><p> The Republic is also progressing on negotiations with more than 15 other countries on this front, in the hope of advancing those partnerships into implementation agreements.

So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.</p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.</p><p> Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.</p><p> In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.</p><p> Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.</p><p> While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.</p><p> Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.</p><p> For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.</p><p> Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.</p><p> Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.</p><p> One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.</p><p> This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.</p><p> Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.</p><p> Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.</p><p> \"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.</p><p> Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.</p><p> The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.</p><p> Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.</p><p> However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.</p><p> In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.</p><p> To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.</p><p> Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.</p><p> The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.</p><p> Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.</p><p> \"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much...

Why are investors hesitant, and what needs to be done to get climate-aware investing into the mainstream'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  We have witnessed continuous improvement and strong efforts to transition our global economies to a net-zero future. According to the International Energy Agency, last year's global investments in clean energy were around double the amount going into fossil fuels. Ten years ago, fossil fuel investments were about 20 per cent larger than clean energy investments. Meanwhile, India is projected to achieve a major milestone in 2025, with renewable electricity providing for more than half of the country's power capacity, while China added more renewable power capacity in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Notwithstanding this, current investment flows are still insufficient to allow us to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, complexities in the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape have understandably made investors more cautious in recent times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Importantly, sustainable investing is not a short-term but a structural trend. Climate risk is increasingly recognised as a major driver of financial risk. Hence, most major investors integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their overall decision process.</p><p> Encouragingly, Asian regulators are stepping up. Across the region, many policies and regulations have been put in place that create an enabling environment, which supports climate action and related financing flows. This includes green and transition taxonomies and ESG disclosure standards.</p><p> These developments bolster investor confidence and embed greater transparency in sustainable investing -- important steps in shifting these financing flows into the mainstream.</p><p> More work needs to be done. For instance, there is some ambiguity around what qualifies as transition and transition finance. The vast majority of assets and economic activities globally and in Asia are not yet green, and DBS believes it is critical to also allocate capital to support their transition to becoming greener. Beyond financing those assets and activities, transition finance can also help companies transform their entire businesses, all of which will contribute to the greening of the entire economy.</p><p> We see progress across the region on several fronts. Localised taxonomies are evolving to reflect regional contexts and developmental needs. Markets like Singapore are evolving disclosure rules and incentives for credible transition finance.</p><p> At DBS, we have observed growing sophistication in how capital is being deployed. For instance, we saw strong investor appetite for two green bonds DBS brought to the market recently. The first was the issuance of Equinix's S$500 million green bond in March 2025, its first Singapore dollar issuance.</p><p> The second was Asia's first public sustainability-linked securities offering by ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in January 2024. Both bonds were meaningfully oversubscribed, signalling growing investor demand for credible climate instruments.</p><p>  Investors' hesitation around sustainable or climate-aware investing, despite growing interest, often stems from structural challenges and other key concerns.</p><p> For example, the lack of standardisation and transparency in how ESG factors are assessed and reported. Without consistent metrics, it becomes difficult for investors to compare ESG investment products and evaluate their true impact. Additionally, some investors are concerned that corporates and governments may scale back their climate commitments which affect the short-term viability of such investments.</p><p> At UOB Asset Management, we view ESG integration as a strategic tool for value creation and risk mitigation. By embedding ESG considerations into our investment process, we aim to support long-term sustainability for our investees and their businesses. We also recognise that some investors may wish to explore and capitalise on advanced strategies to achieve specific impact or invest in specific themes. To meet these needs, we make ESG a core element of our investment thesis, aligning our strategies with both market realities and investor aspirations.</p><p>  One of the key considerations for investors when it comes to their investment decisions is the potential return. The recent increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape have tested investors' appetite to commit to sustainable investments since they are unsure about the future regulatory environment and the impact it may have on their investment returns. In addition, some investors may be hesitant given concerns about low-quality ESG data, greenwashing, as well as the perceived trade-off between sustainability and returns.</p><p> While interest in sustainable investment may fluctuate from time to time due to market sentiments and the geopolitical context, we believe that the overarching trend towards investments that take ESG factors and risks into consideration is here to stay. The challenges of sustainable investment are also being actively addressed.</p><p> Collaboration between stakeholders -- asset managers, data providers and regulatory bodies -- is paving the way for more standardisation in reporting frameworks and taxonomies, which will help mitigate concerns on data quality and greenwashing. Meanwhile, leading financial institutions are developing diverse and accessible products catering to varying preferences and risks appetites, and -- over time -- are also showing that sustainable investments can deliver required returns.</p><p> Sometimes, enabling investors with information can also make a big difference in mainstreaming sustainable investing. Take, for example, the OCBC Sustainability Hub, launched in 2024.</p><p> The innovative platform empowers investors with a personal ESG rating, enabling them to track, understand and act on their investments, and to make informed financial decisions.</p><p> Within just six months of its launch, the Sustainability Hub achieved a 2.3x year-on-year increase in sustainability-themed investments.</p><p>  What do you see as the most promising areas of investments for corporates and individuals that will address climate risks and reap a return'</p><p>  The business case for climate-aligned investing remains robust particularly in Asia, where climate risk is acute, economic growth is rapid, and the green transition is gaining momentum.</p><p> We see strong opportunities emerging across several areas that offer both meaningful climate impact and attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p><p> One such area is energy. Investments in solar, wind and battery storage systems are increasingly competitive against fossil fuel alternatives. More importantly, enablers such as smart grids and demand management technologies -- especially in high-growth urban centres -- are essential to stabilising renewable energy supply and unlocking further scale.</p><p> Mobility is another sector where climate action meets opportunity. Across Asia, countries are racing ahead in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, charging infrastructure and intelligent traffic systems. Innovations such as ultra-fast charging and connected transport systems are also improving convenience and range, spurring consumer adoption.</p><p> Investors are increasingly focused on mobility platforms, EV supply chains and battery recycling, all of which present strong growth prospects as urbanisation and climate pressure reshape how people and goods move across the region.</p><p> In the agriculture sector, South-east Asia's role as a major rice producer makes agricultural adaptation a top priority. Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods.</p><p> With strong social returns, such investments are increasingly attracting private capital, from agribusinesses investing in resilient seeds to impact investors funding water-saving irrigation technologies.</p><p> Another high-impact, cost-effective climate adaptation strategy is investing in nature-based solutions.</p><p> Restoring and protecting ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs and forests provides \"natural infrastructure\" that reduces disaster risks, regulates water flows, buffers heat and sequesters carbon.</p><p> For instance, mangrove restoration in Vietnam and the Philippines has proven effective in shielding coastal communities from storm surges. These solutions are relatively low-cost compared to traditional infrastructure such as concrete sea walls.</p><p> We are also seeing transition finance emerge as an investment theme, which is why we enhanced our Transition Finance Framework in 2025 -- to provide clients and stakeholders with greater clarity and transparency on eligible transition financing activities and enhance access to the financial resources required to accelerate climate action. This creates confidence not just for the bank but also for other ecosystem players.</p><p>  Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to gain traction as demand for clean power grows. Promising investment areas that address climate risks while delivering returns include:</p><p>  In its 2025 Supertrends Report, the chief investment office at our private banking subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, stated its view that the power-hungry nature of technology and the energy transition will accelerate over the medium term. This will be fuelled by the proliferation of AI use cases and the accelerating demand growth for electricity over the long term, driven by developments in the clean energy transition, electric mobility, cooling, data centres and AI sectors.</p><p> As improvements in energy efficiencies of data centres, cooling and power systems infrastructure will be required, the search for cleaner energy sources including solar, wind and nuclear technologies to supplement existing energy sources will present investment opportunities.</p><p> While the US has sidelined the green agenda for now, the global shift towards clean energy remains crucial for humanity's long-term survival and offers substantial economic and investment prospects. According to a World Economic Forum White Paper from 2023, an estimated additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and 232 million new jobs could be created in Asia by 2030 due to climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. We see opportunities in companies with exposure to clean energy and EVs, as well as transition enablers focused on smart grid infrastructure, energy storage and efficiency, and producers of metals and minerals.</p><p> Policy shifts have also enabled the oil and gas industry to be part of the energy transition, by leveraging technology -- bioenergy and carbon capture -- and the ability to manage complex energy systems.</p><p> From a geographical perspective, China in particular has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for over 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> Plugging the funding gap to mitigate climate risks is even more challenging today amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. What do you see as the most promising sources of capital that remain relatively untapped, and how can corporates help'</p><p> Despite the positive momentum described earlier, the financing gap for climate action in Asia remains daunting.</p><p> DBS estimates that over the next decade, the region will require approximately US$2.2 trillion for mitigation, US$2.5 trillion for adaptation, and a further 10 per cent of that total for resilience-related investments. In comparison, climate finance flows to South-east Asia from 2018 to 2019 totalled just US$27.8 billion annually. Even if this were to increase to US$50 billion annually, the shortfall over 10 years would still exceed US$4 trillion.</p><p> While the scale of capital needed is immense, it is not necessarily capital availability that is the issue -- rather, it is the lack of risk-adjusted returns that remain attractive enough to mobilise capital at scale. The priority must be on designing financing structures that shift the risk-return profile in favour of scalable investments.</p><p> This is where policy and regulatory frameworks become essential. Policymakers and regulators can create enabling environments through measures such as regulatory clarity on transition plans and incentives for green investments -- which can reduce uncertainty and improve the bankability of climate projects.</p><p> At the same time, financial innovation plays a pivotal role in unlocking new capital at a larger scale, such as concessionary and philanthropic capital. Structures like blended finance are particularly promising. They can de-risk early-stage projects, helping to crowd in commercial capital. For example, DBS inked a loan agreement alongside Karian Water Services, Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.</p><p> The loan went towards the development of a regional water supply system to deliver fresh water to around two million people across Jakarta, Tangerang and South Tangerang, marking the first blended finance transaction in the water sector in Indonesia.</p><p> We are also seeing the potential of transition credits to support decarbonisation pathways in hard-to-abate sectors. DBS co-leads a working group under the Transition Credits Coalition convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It seeks to catalyse the creation of high-integrity, transition-related carbon credits. A core focus is to support the early and managed phaseout of thermal coal power across Asia, paving the way for credible, just-transition pathways -- particularly in industrial and emissions-intensive sectors.</p><p> As both major asset holders and stakeholders in climate risk, insurers are well-positioned to play a dual role: investing in resilience infrastructure and integrating climate risks into underwriting and asset management. These areas remain relatively untapped, presenting a significant opportunity for impact.</p><p> Corporates also have a critical role to play. They can issue green and sustainability-linked bonds to fund climate-related activities, embed sustainability into procurement as corporates can stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services -- thereby indirectly channelling capital into green innovation -- and engage in transparent reporting aligned with international frameworks. These actions can help build investor confidence and attract ESG-focused capital.</p><p> A good example within Asean is Indonesia, where the funding gap for climate action is particularly prominent. To decarbonise its energy and transportation sectors, Indonesia requires an average investment of US$9.1 billion annually from 2018 to 2030. Under its national plan, the government allocated US$2.1 billion annually from 2020 to 2024, leaving a significant annual shortfall of US$7 billion. This highlights the potential of private financing in advancing climate action.</p><p> Corporates -- especially national banks in Indonesia -- can play a key role in mobilising private financing, as fossil fuels continue to receive a bigger share of private investment compared to renewable energy.</p><p>  There is ample liquidity in the system. Banks are still committed to financing green and transition projects and technologies. One often-cited problem lies in the bankability of such projects is the ability to generate enough cashflow to make it suitable for financing or to attract investors.</p><p> Central to the issue of bankability is risk allocation; allocating specific risks to the party most capable of managing and mitigating them is critical. For instance, in a utility project, having the project offtaker (often a state-owned utility company) take on regulatory risks or manage market demand risks by establishing long-term take-or-pay offtake agreements is one avenue for risk allocation.</p><p> Another problem contributing to the climate finance gap is the high cost of adoption. If the cost of a new green solution is several times that of a fossil fuel-based solution, it simply does not make economic sense for companies to adopt it. To overcome this, governments can consider implementing subsidies and regulations that lower the cost of adoption and stimulate demand in the process. When supply grows along with demand, the cost curves associated with the new technology come down. When the technology becomes economically viable, the financing gap naturally narrows.</p><p> Besides tapping traditional financing for climate finance, there are other funding mechanisms to consider. One is blended finance. Traditionally, blended finance structures have been deployed at the project level, with each individual project attracting capital from different providers including multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, export credit agencies, banks and others.</p><p> As each project has its own risk profile and characteristics, deployment of blended finance at the project level tends to be bespoke and time-consuming, making scalability a challenge.</p><p> To achieve scalability, blended finance structures can be deployed at the fund level which combines capital from multiple stakeholders with different risk-return requirements but with common impact objectives into a single investment scheme. The fund in turn allocates capital to the individual projects.</p><p> Funds have the flexibility to accommodate different risk-return profiles and objectives in the choice of capital providers and fund structure, as well as distribution waterfalls in the fund's documentation. Such flexibility enables the \"crowding in\" of additional capital from commercial investors, achieving scalability to deliver outcomes in areas such as energy transition, climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation.</p><p> An example is the MAS' Financing Asia's Transition Partnership initiative, which aims to use an initial injection of US$500 million by the Singapore Government to raise funding from other sources up to a projected US$5 billion.</p><p> The goal is to finance green projects in Asia focused on accelerating the energy transition, ramping up green investments, and decarbonising emissions-intensive sectors such as cement and steel production.</p><p> Another benefit of blended finance is the blending of knowledge and expertise. The diversity of the participants brings a wealth of knowledge which can be shared. For example, multilateral agencies could advise on governance structures, engage local policymakers in enhancing bankability of project documentation, or provide training on ESG standards. Fund managers bring with them the expertise to evaluate project risks and returns, and to structure the fund to cater to the different investor profiles.</p><p> This supplement was first published in The Business Times on June 5.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods.

They published their research on Jan 9, in the journal Conservation Science And Practice.</p><p> Unagi is the Japanese word for freshwater eels, which are often consumed in East Asia as a grilled and glazed delicacy. High consumer demand for these eels, which belong to the family Anguillidae, have resulted in their being overfished. </p><p> There are about 19 species of freshwater eels, although it is mainly three species that are consumed in Singapore. </p><p> They include the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), European eel (Anguillaanguilla) and American eel (Anguilla rostrata), said the study's principal investigator, Mr Joshua Choo.</p><p> The European eel is critically endangered, while the other two are endangered. </p><p> For the study, Mr Choo -- a Yale-NUS environmental studies undergraduate at the time of the research -- and his team collected 266 freshwater eel meat samples from retailers and online shops that ship products to Singapore in July 2023.</p><p> The researchers then identified the species of eel in each product by extracting its DNA and comparing it against known genetic sequences of different eel species. </p><p> But instead of European eels, the researchers found that a large proportion of eels sold in stores here were American eels. </p><p> Among the 257 unagi products for which DNA was obtained, 217 (84.4 per cent) were identified as the American eel. </p><p> Another 36 samples (14 per cent) were of the Japanese eel, while only three samples were found to contain the European eel. </p><p> One sample turned out to be the pink cusk-eel, a saltwater species incorrectly labelled as unagi.</p><p> According to Mr Choo, this signals a worrying shift -- towards the American eel as a substitute for already depleted European eel stocks. He added that this cycle of exploitation, depletion, and moving on to another species is well-documented in the eel trade.</p><p> The Japanese eel had been the first target species for unagi dishes, but its overconsumption led to population decline, and consequently a rise in its cost.</p><p> But now that population numbers of the European eel are plummeting too, industry preferences are shifting once again to the American eel populations. </p><p> Citing a different study, Mr Choo said: \"East Asia has been importing more and more American eels -- from two tonnes in 2004, to 53 tonnes in 2021 and 157 tonnes in 2022.\"</p><p> Mr Choo said young eels hatch in the open ocean, and swim to freshwater, where they mature into \"glass eels\", as they are known in this stage of their life cycle. </p><p> Subsequently, they change into elvers, yellow eels, then silver eels -- sexually mature adults -- that return to the open ocean to mate and spawn.</p><p> He said: \"The eels only mature and breed after encountering certain environmental conditions during migration -- a journey that is hard to simulate in captivity.\"</p><p> The youngest eels, known as leptocephali, also often die in captivity, Mr Choo said. </p><p> Farmers have thus turned to using wild-caught glass eels as broodstock, and raising them till they grow into yellow and silver eels -- which are then sold to retailers. As with silver eels, yellow eels -- which are the immature adult stage of eels -- are also seen as a delicacy.</p><p> As many are siphoned to aquaculture farms, fewer juvenile eels reach maturity in the wild, resulting in inadequate replacement rates.</p><p> The fishing pressure on these eels is exacerbated by their high value, and the ease of smuggling them, especially as juveniles.</p><p> According to Europol's estimates, the illegal glass eel trade rakes in profits of \"up to EUR3 billion (S$4.36 billion) in peak years\" -- more than that of the illegal arms trade, which generates between EUR125 million to EUR236 million each year, according to the International Monetary Fund.</p><p> Trafficked glass eels are also translucent and small, growing up to only 7cm in length. This makes them difficult to detect, and allows a large quantity of them to be transported at once.</p><p> Aside from fishing pressures, freshwater eels' migration to the ocean may also be impeded by other factors, such as the construction of hydroelectric dams, and changing ocean currents attributed to climate change.</p><p> Mr Choo suggested reducing the consumption of eel meat, or completely eliminating the fish from one's diet. </p><p> Local eel retailers have a role to play as well, said Mr Chester Gan, senior manager of conservation for oceans and nature-based solutions at the World Wide Fund for Nature Singapore.</p><p> He said: \"Making responsible food choices can be challenging for consumers when eel products lack clear labelling -- often missing key details like species, origin and production methods.</p><p> \"But by adopting clearer labelling and ensuring greater transparency in sourcing, they can empower consumers to make informed choices.\"</p><p> Mr Choo also emphasised a need for stronger transboundary cooperation, including efforts to list more endangered eel species on the Cites agreement -- a multilateral treaty to safeguard threatened species from international trade. </p><p> Currently, only the European eels are listed on Cites.</p><p> Mr Choo also said that more research is needed on other eel species, especially understudied tropical anguillid eels like the Celebes longfin eel (Anguilla celebesensis). </p><p> He said: \"The eel trade could expand its reach to include regional relatives to the American and European eel -- which are found in places like Malaysia and the Philippines.

Distinguished guests, speakers, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>2. Good afternoon, and welcome.</p><p>It is my pleasure to join you today for this seminar, jointly organized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Banque de France, as part of the France-Singapore Joint Year of Sustainability (JYOS) - a year-long initiative to deepen collaboration between our two nations on this existential issue.</p><p>3. Since its launch in April 2024, Singapore and France have embarked on a series of collaborations across areas such as the circular economy, renewable energy and sustainable shipping.</p><p>4. Today, we are gathered to discuss what it means to build bridges between Climate and Nature in relation to finance.</p><p>After years of focused attention on addressing the issue of climate-related risk, there is increasing recognition that the loss and degradation of nature represents a similarly significant and interconnected challenge.</p><p>Balance</p><p>5. Apart from our joint commitment to sustainability, one thing that unites the people of Singapore and France is our love of food. And as all foodies will appreciate, a great sauce never happens by accident.</p><p>Whether it is a creamy hollandaise sauce or a rich laksa sauce, it is all about keeping the salt, fat, acid and heat in careful balance. If there is too much reduction or too little acidity, a sauce will break. This happens when the fat separates from the water and other ingredients, turning the sauce from a smooth liquid to something oily and curdled.</p><p>6. Our natural systems work the same way. Climate, biodiversity, forests, oceans, soil - these are not disparate elements, but interdependent units that work in concert to keep the system stable. Forests are crucial carbon sinks and also critical for sustaining biodiversity and maintaining soil health.</p><p>Rising temperatures and extreme weather can accelerate ecosystem loss, releasing stored carbon in a negative feedback loop.</p><p>7. Cooking is as much art as it is science. You don't need to get the balance of elements precisely right, as there is a range of tolerance where the ingredients will still come together beautifully.</p><p>Likewise, maintaining balance in an ecosystem is not about perfection, and more about keeping things within an acceptable range.</p><p>8. Unfortunately, our current trajectory will lead us out of that acceptable range. Last month, the Net Zero Banking Alliance voted to relax its rules to allow members to adopt a more flexible goal of keeping warming well below 2C, as opposed to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The fact is that average global temperatures have already exceeded 1.5C last year.</p><p>9. The change in climate is a key driver of nature loss. Along with other human pressures like land conversion, pollution, and invasive species, ecosystems are degrading faster than they can recover - threatening food, water, and climate stability.</p><p>10. The risks arising from climate change and nature degradation are not academic theories - they are manifesting with increasing frequency and severity:</p><p>a. Last year, record ocean temperatures driven by climate change intensified Typhoon Yagi[1], contributing to heavier rainfall and higher storm surges, which resulted in close to 15 billion USD indamage across eight countries and territories in the region..</p><p>b. At the same time, sustained marine heatwaves triggered the fourth global coral bleaching event, affecting 77% of the world's coral reefs.[2] These events are happening with reduced recovery windows, undermining reef resilience and threatening the fisheries and coastal economies dependent on them.</p><p>NOAA confirms 4th global coral bleaching event. These events are happening with reduced recovery windows, undermining reef resilience and threatening the fisheries and coastal economies dependent on them.</p><p>11. Looking ahead, GDP losses in Asia Pacific are projected to reach 16.9% by 2070 under a high emissions scenario, according to the Asian Development Bank.[3] While there still is a cone of uncertainty in relation to final outcomes, the direction of travel is clear. Financial institutions must be adequately prepared. To be clear, this is about risk management, not altruism or corporate social responsibility.</p><p>Challenge of Addressing Nature Risk</p><p>12. In 2020, the MAS issued a set of Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management (ENRM). These guidelines will shortly be complemented with additional guidance on transition planning that we had earlier consulted on.</p><p>13. Despite references to risks beyond climate, we have taken a climate-first approach as the understanding of best practices to address nature risk is still developing. Singapore-based FIs have made meaningful progress in integrating climate-related risk into their risk management frameworks.</p><p>14. In contrast, most financial institutions are still at an early stage of systematically measuring and addressing nature-related risks. This is due to the complexity and diversity of ecosystem services - such as water, pollination, and soil health. FIs have to consider all these elements from a dependency and impact lens as part of their risk assessment.</p><p>15. For climate-related risk, a single CO metric - despite all its limitations as a point-in-time measure - allows different stakeholders to have a common point of reference. Measuring nature is much more complicated. One study suggests that up to 3,000 distinct ecosystem services may need classification for effective economic modelling.[4]</p><p>16. Nonetheless, we draw inspiration from Victor Hugo, who said that \"perseverance (is the) secret of all triumphs\". European FIs - and notably French institutions - are among the most advanced in integrating nature-related considerations into their governance, risk management frameworks, and disclosures. We have much to learn from them.</p><p>17. Singapore is also moving forward. Last month, the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA) released a whitepaper entitled \"Financing Our Natural Capital\" to help FIs in Singapore and the region address nature-related risks and opportunities. The whitepaper contextualises global frameworks and tools to the region. This enables FIs to identify sectors with material nature impact and dependencies in their portfolios; and take practical steps to incorporate nature into their business activities. MAS will continue to support the financial sector, through the SSFA, in building capacity to address nature-related risks and unlock financing opportunities.</p><p>18. I also commend the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) - in particular its Taskforce on Nature-related Risks - for developing scenarios for nature-related financial risks[5] and guiding the actions of central banks and supervisors through a conceptual framework[6]. MAS has had the privilege of working alongside Banque de France on several NGFS initiatives, and we look forward to our continued collaboration.</p><p>Carbon Markets a stabilising force</p><p>19. As financial institutions address these risks by adjusting portfolios, engaging clients, and enhancing risk assessments, carbon markets can serve as an additional lever to motivate firms to take action and allow parties to better hedge exposures.</p><p>20.From a climate angle, carbon markets provide a price signal for emissions and allow firms to invest in mitigation beyond their immediate operations, even as they work toward internal abatement. From a nature angle, credits from nature-based solutions - such as reforestation, peatland restoration, or mangrove conservation - offer a way to finance conservation at scale. Done well, these projects can deliver both climate mitigation and biodiversity benefits.</p><p>21. Demand for high-quality carbon credits is expected to grow. By some estimates, global voluntary carbon markets could grow to 1 trillion USD annually by 2050.[7] Much of that opportunity is right here in Southeast Asia, which is rich in nature resources, offering significant potential for carbon projects, such as forestation and blue carbon.</p><p>22. While challenges remain amid geopolitical volatility, we are confident in the medium-term growth potential of carbon markets. The finalisation of Article 6 rules at COP29, and the growing acceptance of carbon credits by governments, can lend credence and renew confidence in international carbon markets.</p><p>23. Well-functioning carbon markets complement the decarbonisation efforts of firms, while channelling capital into sustainable and often nature-positive projects. They can serve as a stabilizing force, strengthening the delicate balance between climate and nature.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>24. In conclusion, just as a great chef watches the sauce, a wise society watches the planet.</p><p>25. A chef does not wait for a sauce to break before taking action. Likewise, we cannot wait for ecosystems to collapse before we act. We are already seeing the early signs of deterioration and should not take false comfort that the tipping points have not been breached. A sauce that breaks can be saved in certain circumstances, but not always - so prevention is the better path.</p><p>26. Do we continue to stir the sauce and lament that it is difficult to do anything differently? Or do we recognise the risks and take active steps to maintain the delicate balance that we may have taken for granted? Carbon markets will be part of the solution to support the coming transition, and we need more good ideas and courage if we are to make this transition well.</p><p>27. Today's panels will delve deeper into these critical issues. We believe that by working together, we can move beyond short-termism and create a system that is stable, sustainable, and built to last.</p><p>28.

The effectiveness of nature-based solutions, in particular, should not be underestimated.Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first \"Global Stocktake\" synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.Adaptation measures Lubo Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re, said historical estimates show that Asia has suffered the highest flood-related economic losses. Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.Neha Bhatia, partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, also pointed out that there have been studies that estimate rising sea levels might slash between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of South-east Asia's total gross domestic product over the next 50 years in the worst-case scenario.Beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers said.Noting that nature-based solutions are not only cost-effective, but also help to drive carbon sequestration and support biodiversity well-being, Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact, said that policymakers should focus first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems.With a better understanding and valuation of the Earth's natural ecosystems, businesses will also be better able to incorporate these resources into their decision-making, such as ensuring that there are sufficient climate resilience considerations through the environmental impact assessments of new development projects, they added.Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures help to evaluate nature and biodiversity and contextualise the financial impact that businesses will feel should these resources not be managed.Hence, beyond governments, private entities also have a vested interest in investing in the conservation of these ecosystems as it protects their assets, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific climate and resilience hub.\"(We've) been getting these ecosystem services for free. </p><p>So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus\u00c2\u00a0resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.\"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.\"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much... There is just no future without investments in adaptation,\" she added.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["FLOODS, droughts and chronic heat are the most pressing areas in which South-east Asian countries must prioritise adaptation investments, sustainability professionals told The Business Times.

Studies show that eco-anxiety is rising, particularly among young people. Social media amplifies this distress, making it feel as if the future is already beyond repair. Those with eco-anxiety often experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and stress, and report lower overall mental well-being. The stress of knowing what is happening to our planet can breed powerlessness and even apathy.</p><p> A young woman I know had to quit her job due to eco-anxiety, coupled with the guilt of complicity in \"greenwashing\" -- conveying a false impression that a company's products are environmentally sound -- at one of the top employers in Singapore. \"I was feeling more and more depressed, and dreaded going to work every day,\" she said. </p><p> She is not alone. More than a few young working adults have reached out to me in recent times to share how conflicted and in despair they felt working for companies that simply did not care about the climate crisis. This inevitably leads to presenteeism -- physically present but mentally absent -- and quiet quitting.  </p><p> Yet, the dual crises of mental health and climate change have long been viewed as separate challenges. As we gain a deeper understanding, it becomes clear that they are intricately interconnected. Mental health, once sidelined, is now receiving the attention it deserves. Similarly, climate change is not just an environmental issue but a public health and humanitarian emergency.</p><p> As both of these crises intensify, we must approach them not as isolated issues, but as two sides of the same coin. Initiatives including the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy and the Green Plan 2030 are a step in the right direction as mental well-being is being introduced in climate resilience discussions, and vice versa, but Singapore must do more in this nexus of climate change and mental health.</p><p> Integrating mental health, climate approaches We cannot build resilient societies without addressing the trauma and displacement caused by climate change, nor can we create a healthy environment without a mentally healthy population. </p><p> As such, we must deal with the two biggest crises of our time in concert, not in silos. </p><p> However, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change for the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) under the Prime Minister's Office does not include the Ministry of Health, which leads the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy launched in 2024 to tackle mental health, now recognised as a significant health and social issue. </p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health Office (NMHO) -- to be fully established in 2025 -- is co-led by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social and Family Development, and comprises officers from the ministries of Education and Manpower -- but notably without any representation from the environment and sustainability agencies. </p><p> What are we missing here? With mental health a national priority and climate change an existential threat, the absence of integration in these national organisations creates a critical gap. </p><p>Singapore may not have to contend with the severe psychological impact of frequent natural disasters and climate-related migration that other countries are dealing with. However, rising temperatures and its mental health impact -- such as heat stress, especially for rental flat households and essential workers -- must be urgently considered. Some studies have found that a rise in temperature is associated with aggressive behaviour and suicidality. </p><p> The rise of eco-anxiety, particularly among Singapore's youth, also highlights the urgency of this cross collaboration and representation in NCCS and NMHO. A group of young people I spoke with at a university questioned whether it would be even responsible of them to bring children into a world grappling with climate change, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity. Such significant attitudinal changes could have far-reaching implications for Singapore's policies, particularly in areas such as public health, social development and economic sustainability. </p><p> It is also important to note that climate change doesn't just affect mental health -- it can also be worsened by poor mental health. When people are struggling with their mental health, they may feel overwhelmed, helpless or disconnected, making it more difficult for them to engage in proactive measures to address climate issues.</p><p> By ensuring that climate policies include mental health considerations, and vice versa, we can better support vulnerable populations and equip individuals with the resilience, motivation, and hope to confront climate challenges. </p><p> As well, the intersection of climate change and mental health presents new opportunities for research, policy and practice. This could include integrating mental health support into climate adaptation plans, extending climate finance to mental health services, and fostering community-led initiatives and creative approaches to address climate-induced stress. </p><p> How to survive and thrive'Mental health has worsened in Singapore since 2020, according to the Ministry of Health's National Population Health survey. Singaporeans have identified mental health as the biggest health problem, surpassing concerns about cancer and diabetes. Worryingly, one in three between the ages of 15 and 35 experiences severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress.</p><p> Experts found that youth mental well-being depends on connections in their social and environmental contexts. It's no wonder these same experts warn that the price of climate inaction will be the mental health of young people. </p><p> We must build environments where individuals can thrive, not just survive. Healing happens in ecosystems of care -- not in isolation. Such an ecosystem ranges from workplaces that prioritise psychological safety to schools that nurture emotional intelligence, to policies that embed mental health into broader social systems.</p><p> In this way, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy was a significant step towards addressing the crisis here, moving beyond crisis intervention to a full spectrum of care: prevention, early intervention, resilience-building, and community-based well-being.</p><p> The link between community well-being and nature is especially crucial in urban settings like Singapore, where green spaces play a vital role in fostering mental health and social cohesion. Shared experiences in nature can strengthen social bonds and foster a sense of community. As climate change threatens the environment, these natural spaces are at risk. When nature is degraded, not only is the physical environment compromised, but the mental and emotional resilience of the community is also weakened. </p><p> While working towards creating thriving individuals and communities, we must also focus on ensuring a thriving planet. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for over 50 per cent of the world's heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> In Singapore, we are experiencing rising sea levels, extreme heat and climate-related health risks. A deteriorating natural environment undermines efforts to foster mental and emotional resilience. So protecting our ecosystems is not just about preserving biodiversity, but safeguarding the mental health of our future generations. </p><p> Reasons for hopeI was delighted when the Singapore Green Plan 2030 launched in 2021 included the creation of spaces that promote mental well-being, reduce stress and enhance resilience.</p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy includes nature-based solutions, such as creating 30 therapeutic gardens across Singapore by 2030. These spaces will provide restorative environments for people with conditions like ADHD and dementia. </p><p> Furthermore, building codes now prioritise occupant well-being, with the Green Mark certification scheme and the Building Control Act playing key roles in promoting healthy, sustainable buildings.</p><p> And more recently, the Mercury Taskforce, comprising 37 public agencies led by the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment and National Environment Agency, announced the first National Heatwave Response Plan for Singapore. </p><p> The intersection of mental health and sustainability within environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks is increasingly critical for businesses. Investors are placing greater emphasis on companies that prioritise not only environmental sustainability but also the well-being of their employees and communities. </p><p> Healing from eco-anxietyThe way we treat our planet mirrors the way we treat ourselves. A world that exhausts its natural resources is the same world that exhausts its people. The burnout we feel individually is a reflection of the unsustainable systems we have created. If we want to heal the planet, we must also heal ourselves.</p><p> For me, healing has always come from nature. As a child, trees were my refuge from bullying. Thirty years later, amid a series of personal crises including a broken marriage, shattered career and financial ruin, I found myself hugging a tree again. And since then, I have hugged a tree every week after my regular run. </p><p> There's no single way forward, but there is hope in both individual and collective action.

South-east Asia's huge potential in unlocking revenues from carbon credits is well-known, given its abundant forest and coastal ecosystems. \"There is a lot of validity in the fact that if you invest in nature and do that in the right way, there is a better, longer-term benefit to be had."]}, {"relevance_score": 25, "title": "Searching for bankable nature-based solutions", "published": "2022-10-21", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">WHEN it comes to preventing climate change, our strongest ally is nature itself, but the drive to unleash nature's full potential to absorb carbon, prevent floods and heal from years of abuse is struggling.The biggest barrier to creating a sustainable future is not climate scepticism, or the scale of the problem or even cost: It's an accounting anomaly.The value of our natural environment does not appear as an asset on our national accounts or corporate balance sheets, nor does pollution or diminishing biodiversity appear as costs. Beyond the obvious problem that this arrangement does nothing to deter new emissions or preserve vital environmental systems by registering the costs of pollution or damage to biodiversity, it also means there is no immediate bottom-line return on investment in sustainable business practices.This poses a significant challenge when it comes to encouraging businesses to support nature-based solutions to address issues such as climate change, human health, food and water security, and reduce the risk of natural disasters by protecting, preserving, or restoring natural ecosystems.The connection between protecting the environment and saving costs is well established. A report published by the Nature Conservancy and others estimated that mangroves alone protect property from damage valued at US$82 billion each year, but in the short term, there is greater profit in cutting down the mangroves and using the land for fish farming or other agricultural production.Although the transition to a net-zero future will cost tens and possibly hundreds of trillions of dollars, the money seems to be available: The 450 firms which joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in April 2021 between them manage US$130 trillion in assets, and many individual savers are starting to insist that their pensions schemes or college funds are invested in sustainable assets. </p><p>The problem is less a shortage of money than a shortage of projects that are both sustainable and bankable.The growing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if largely still voluntary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c market for carbon credits, driven by governments and companies like HSBC which have made fixed pledges to transition to carbon-neutral operations, is an encouraging development. These range from Gabon's recent offering of 90 million tonnes of sovereign carbon credits; to Norway's new agreement to pay Indonesia to preserve forests under the United Nation's REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) scheme; to more ambitious debt-for-nature swaps where creditors forgive debt in return for undertakings to preserve or expand natural assets.But all these schemes have struggled with definitional loopholes and enforcement issues. Climate-related agreements and financial instruments are still evolving, and there is no generally agreed consensus on terms or terminology. Various groupings in Europe, Asia and the Americas are working to come up with what is known as a \"taxonomy\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a framework that defines what is a green asset and what is not.This lack of consensus is limiting the expansion of the market for green bonds, many of which have a nature-based component, if only as a carbon offset. To be fair, the issues are complex. If a company is raising money to build a new factory and is promising to compensate for its carbon output by planting trees, is it going to plant millions of the same species and are those species native or not, either of which would be detrimental to biodiversity? What are they going to replace? Where is the water going to come from'The market is hungry for green financial products, many of which will have nature-based components, but until asset managers have the confidence that the funding will be used sustainably, they will be reluctant to commit at anything close to the scale we need to contain and reverse climate change.Clear taxonomies also hold the potential to unleash the power of central banks. Central banks, with their remit to preserve and enhance the long-term health of the economy, have a clear interest in limiting global warming.Ma Jun, a former member of the People's Bank of China monetary committee and current co-chair of the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, has suggested that central banks could increase green lending by offering commercial banks cheaper financing for their green loan book, and others have suggested offsetting green loans against reserve requirements.The profit from investing in strengthening natural systems is real, but rarely registers on our national or corporate balance sheets. But if we are to limit and eventually reverse our impact on the environment, we must find ways to mobilise the investment we need to preserve and enhance nature's powers.Kelvin Tan is head of sustainable finance and investments, Asean, at HSBC and board member of Pentagreen Capital.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["The value of our natural environment does not appear as an asset on our national accounts or corporate balance sheets, nor does pollution or diminishing biodiversity appear as costs.

He says AI has light and dark sides -- such as job displacement and ethical uses -- that need to be rigorously addressed through the university's curriculum.</p><p> While the university is inventing AI systems of the future, it is also conducting research on the philosophy and ethics of AI, called \"Design AI\". This is an intentional approach, as it is widely accepted that AI and human intelligence are partners in innovation. </p><p> \"As newer technologies like AI evolve, we have to increasingly sharpen our ability to discern what is good, what is the truth and what is beauty,\" says Prof Khoo, 56.</p><p> He says that AI itself is agnostic to either good or evil applications, and is dependent on the intention of the human user.</p><p> \"Of overarching importance is to keep human and AI goals aligned,\" he notes.</p><p> As futurists and inventors, design students speculate on all sorts of future possibilities.</p><p> For instance, they conduct research about the design of greener cities, the future of work and the future of healthcare. </p><p> These thought experiments, and the examination of both AI's light and dark sides, allow students to constantly create provocative scenarios that spark engagement and stimulate debate.</p><p> Students in Singapore also have some of the best teachers.

The application improves the connection between students' intuition and their visual output, boosting their creativity while helping them maintain control and ownership. </p><p> Prof Banon experienced first-hand the problem that designers grappled with to maintain control of and execute their vision using AI. His user-friendly application, which he christened FORMAS.AI -- \"formas\" is Spanish for \"forms\" -- turns sketches, coloured shapes and 3D images into textured visualisations and 3D-printable geometry with one click. </p><p> More than 2,000 architects, interior designers, educators and students globally are early users in the private beta version of the application, ahead of its end-Maypublic launch.</p><p> By making each step of the AI-driven creative process more transparent and controllable, users transition from being led by the AI's creations to actively guiding its development. This helps preserve their personal style while leveraging data-driven tools.</p><p> \"Since 2022, we have been integrating image-based diffusion models to enhance foundational design skills from the first semester at SUTD,\" says Prof Banon, 46. He is also the co-founder of Spanish architectural firm Subarquitectura Architects and co-founder of research laboratory AirLab@SUTD.</p><p> In his classes, students still draw on tracing paper and use cardboard study models, as they are encouraged to nurture primary thoughts and intuition. </p><p> But the moment a spark of brilliance takes shape, they sketch the idea and feed it into the FORMAS.AI model. It generates a realistic building image with materials and the surrounding environment for context.</p><p> \"In that way, our students develop a new kind of intuition, connecting very basic, abstract shapes and simple operations to complex spatial structures,\" says Prof Banon. \"They then develop new ways to operate in the world, reducing production time and focusing on vital areas revealed during the design process.\"</p><p> Currently, most AI image generators such as Midjourney are able to produce stunning visuals but drift far from the original vision or sketches, says Prof Banon. </p><p> On the other hand, FORMAS.AI's intuitive interface empowers designers to experiment and iterate using basic shapes. The output ranges from a high-resolution architectural rendering to an image that can be fed to 3D printers to produce a prototype.</p><p> \"Innovative architectural design often starts with a personal vision -- something only you notice about a site, the climate, a pattern of living,\" Prof Banon says. </p><p> \"It is that 'trained vision' that architects develop over time, something that can be transformative as we consider many factors -- combining science, art and technological intuition. AI should amplify and sharpen that hunch, not overshadow or replace it.\"</p><p>  Info: To see examples of what users globally are generating, go to FORMAS.AI </p><p> An AI-powered Design Brain for architectsWhen humans draw up architectural plans, they bring a lifetime of lived experiences, sensory input and emotional understanding to the table. They intuitively grasp spatial relationships, human needs and the feeling a space should evoke. </p><p> Currently, AI is unable to do this. An AI program needs to be fed large amounts of data which it identifies as patterns, recombining existing elements and optimising results within clearly defined parameters.</p><p> AI also lacks the physical and emotional experiences that shape human intuition about space and form. </p><p> Assistant professor Immanuel Koh of SUTD's Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar and Design and Artificial Intelligence programme is working on changing that. </p><p> His \"Design Brain\" project was conceived in 2024 with the aim of developing AI models capable of digesting, perceiving, understanding, learning, remembering, generating and evaluating designs -- specifically, architectural designs.</p><p> This is despite architecture being one of the most complex design disciplines in the world, demanding both creativity and logic.</p><p> Prof Koh has found that while there are many aspects to the project, the problem of spatial design reasoning -- and creative \"unreasoning\" -- is the most critical and difficult to solve.</p><p> For AI to truly power the design process and production, both humans and AI need to first communicate why, when and how specific design decisions are made during the iterative process.</p><p> \"It is difficult because it requires a transdisciplinary conceptual understanding and technical skills that lie at the intersection of design and AI,\" says Prof Koh, who also directs Artificial-Architecture at SUTD. </p><p> Artificial-Architecture is an interdisciplinary research laboratory that focuses on the design and development of deep learning models for artificial creativity, neurocognitive design, generative architecture, predictive urbanism and defence intelligence.</p><p> Artificial-Architecture has a slate of funded projects that include tie-ups with industry, academia and government agencies, such as AI Singapore and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.</p><p> Design Brain tries to create visible parallel chains of reasoning design actions throughout the process that can be performed, observed and augmented by human designers and autonomous software agents. An autonomous software agent is capable of making design decisions on its own.</p><p> \"I see AI as having the potential to not only automate or 'compress' existing design workflows that are currently conceived by human architects in a top-down manner, but also, even more radically, to un-automate or 'expand' existing design thinking habits that are yet to be conceived, using AI in a new bottom-up manner,\" says Prof Koh. </p><p> He worked with London-based design practice Zaha Hadid Architects from 2011 to 2014 before joining SUTD in 2019 to teach what he says is the world's first dedicated \"AI x Architecture\" module. </p><p> On Design Brain, Prof Koh says: \"The importance of this research lies in gaining a deeper mutual qualitative and quantitative understanding of the evolving gap between the intelligent architectural capabilities of AI and those of human architects. </p><p> \"At this point in time, it functions as a litmus test to see if an AI model can acquire the design skillsets of a human architect.\"</p><p> Analysing the ear canal through light imaging and machine learningAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), customised hearing aids can help cut the rate of cognitive decline by nearly half in seniors at a higher risk of dementia. </p><p> WHO says that nearly 2.5 billion people globally may have some degree of hearing loss by 2050, and more than 700 million will require hearing rehabilitation. </p><p> To create a more accurate mould of the outer ear for hearing aids, ear specialists in Singapore led by Dr Kenneth Chua, formerly from Changi General Hospital (CGH), collaborated with SUTD associate professor Stylianos Dritsas from 2020 to 2023. </p><p> Prof Dritsas teaches design computation and robotics, combining design, geometry, computing and manufacturing methods. </p><p> He worked with the CGH team to improve the way hearing aids are made, using machine learning. This is a field of study in AI centred on the development and study of algorithms that can learn from data and go on to create scenarios without relying on explicit instructions.</p><p> Fitting hearing aids typically involves injecting silicone into patients' ears. This produces ear canal moulds which are then scanned using 3D imaging to create digital ear canal impressions. </p><p> But before digital impressions can be used by doctors, the printouts require a lot of manual 3D editing. </p><p> Prof Dritsas and his team at SUTD helped Dr Chua -- now a principal audiologist at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre -- with computational methods to pre-process ear canal impressions. The project ended earlier in 2025, but there are plans for an extension to conduct more studies.  </p><p> The goal is to develop automated tools to help design better hearing aids. This will improve manufacturing and fitting the aids, and help standardise ear canal data for research purposes.</p><p> Prof Dritsas points out that in traditional computer programming, tasks that require visual intelligence and a qualitative assessment are very difficult to express via simple rules fed into a computer.</p><p> However, with AI, it is possible to provide enough examples for the computer program to understand the trends and patterns, and enable it to perform these tasks without explicitly being guided by a human.</p><p> \"The key finding of the ear canal project is that, unlike classical geometric analyses which require 'clean' or comprehensive data, the machine learning models are able to work with 'noisy' (incomplete) data from the real world,\" says Prof Dritsas, 48, a founding member of SUTD.</p><p> \"During the process, something unexpected happened,\" he recalls. </p><p> \"The machine learning model scrutinised the team's main printouts of the outer ear shapes thoroughly and was able to spot errors. This occurred because some of our data samples were off the general trend.</p><p> \"So, it provided highly intelligent guesses to improve the end-product.\"</p><p> Prof Dritsas says the machine learning model is a pioneering technology. One of its \"superpowers\" is the ability to make hyper-intelligent assessments for a final read-out that is more than 90 per cent accurate. </p><p> \"The model learnt something objective by combining subjective opinions of experts and collective knowledge from the team,\" he adds.</p><p>  \"This is something very powerful about machine learning that is not yet well understood, and which has enormous potential.\"</p><p> Sharing knowledge about coastal protectionProtecting coastlines from rising sea levels due to climate change is a top priority, says SUTD professor of practice Eva Castro from the Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar.</p><p> As the director of the Centre for Climate Adaptation (CCA), housed within the Upper Changi campus, she uses AI to generate visualisations of projected scenarios faster than in previous years, when the technology was not so advanced.</p><p> Instead of manually selecting chart types and visual encodings, AI-powered tools can automatically suggest the most effective visualisations to represent data and highlight key insights. </p><p> This allows Prof Castro to ideate and iterate large-scale infrastructure proposals for coastal resilience that can be shared across borders to help stakeholders such as overseas researchers, scientists and government agencies.</p><p> AI has also helped to break down complex design concepts for stakeholders to access and comprehend information that would otherwise be understood only by specialists or experts.</p><p> \"The CCA agenda is centred on archipelagos, so we have been working with coastal areas, developing a new understanding of the meaning of coastal resilience and the role the ocean plays within it, designing hybrid as well as nature-based solutions to inhabit possible futures,\" says Prof Castro, 53.</p><p> One of CCA's ongoing research programmes is the Long Island project, which involves reclaiming land at higher levels off East Coast and placing them in the form of \"islands\" located a distance away from the existing coastline.</p><p> The programme, aimed at helping Singapore's efforts in coastal protection, is expected to reclaim about 800ha of land off East Coast.</p><p> It will be progressively implemented from 2030 and will stretch over a few decades, according to national water agency PUB.</p><p> Prof Castro says the aim of her work is to produce more inclusive processes of design that help in sharing knowledge and engaging society at large.</p><p> \"As designers, we want to promote the importance of our role within the infrastructural projects that define the cities we inhabit,\" she says. \"In doing so, we believe we are strategists who know how to operate across diverse scales and typologies.\"</p><p> Collaborative intelligence, instead of artificial intelligenceArchitecture graduate and PhD candidate Daryl Ho believes AI will not take over the jobs of humans, but will be more of a reliable assistant to designers. Think collaborative intelligence rather than artificial intelligence, he says.</p><p> The 30-year-old is working on a few \"wonder\", or speculative, projects, which look into how the medium of extended reality (XR) can augment the way humans interact with AI beyond the standard user interface. </p><p> The way humans engage with AI should not be limited to buttons and text prompts, he says. Through XR, users can make use of space for new forms of interaction and collaboration with AI.</p><p> \"One of my projects looks into how AI can be a creative partner that helps users design their own virtual environments,\" says Mr Ho, whose research is in understanding XR through the perspective of an architect designing spaces for people to interact in. </p><p> His goal is to find ways for people to curate their own spaces within the metaverse or virtual world, not only through appearance, but also via interactivity with the environment. </p><p> In this project, AI collaborates with the users, responding to their actions through sounds, colour and placing design suggestions of its own. </p><p> This allows designers within a virtual environment to create together with AI in a social, embodied manner.</p><p> Another project looks at how AI can redefine how people interact with information, not as static elements taken from a webpage, but as dynamic agents that respond to the user and one another. </p><p> \"Much of the information we find online is presented to us through search engines, websites and online repositories that for the large part remain static 2D interfaces,\" he says.</p><p> \"Through XR and AI, we can change the way a person receives and makes sense of information.\"</p><p> Imagine information as little AI helpers living inside a virtual world. Instead of just looking at words and pictures on a screen, one can interact with these AI helpers directly. </p><p> This allows the individual to explore information in a dynamic 3D way, beyond the flat screen of the computer.</p><p> \"The metaverse is still a nascent force,\" adds Mr Ho, highlighting that its implications make it an important future for designers to speculate about. If XR and AI become ubiquitous at a scale akin to that of the internet now, how does one engage with such spaces'</p><p> \"My research looks into tapping the principles of the metaverse to find novel ways in which we might be able to work, create and play with an ever-evolving digital landscape.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["This allows Prof Castro to ideate and iterate large-scale infrastructure proposals for coastal resilience that can be shared across borders to help stakeholders such as overseas researchers, scientists and government agencies.

Humans have been planting trees for centuries to control erosion, for example. Suvro Sarkar, analyst at DBS Group Research, said forest and wetlands conservation as well as active afforestation and reforestation still remain key focus areas. Others include blue carbon projects, which involve harnessing the power of carbon sequestration through algae, mangroves, seagrasses and other plants in coastal areas. Soil carbon and agriculture projects could also help in reducing emissions from soil degradation and food production practices. </p><p> But new opportunities have risen in today's modern economy. The development of carbon markets can play a major role in financing these nature-based solutions. </p><p> Koh said that governments and businesses are sourcing for\u00a0nature-based carbon credits mainly from international voluntary carbon markets or from carbon project developers directly. \"Most of these credits derive from forest conservation projects and reforestation projects, which generate carbon emission avoidance credits and carbon dioxide removal credits, respectively.\" </p><p> According to global asset manager BlackRock, there is tremendous growth potential for voluntary carbon markets, as corporates, industries and governments race to meet their net-zero commitments. The total addressable market for voluntary carbon markets is expected to grow by between 15 and 60 times by 2030. </p><p> Based on forecasts from Trove Research, a data and advisory company specialising in climate strategy and carbon markets, the value of carbon offsets will grow from US$2.8 billion in 2021 to US$63 billion in 2030.</p><p> It also projected that the carbon credit price has to at least double from US$10 per tonne in 2020 to between US$20 and US$30 per tonne in 2030 in order to incentivise sufficient investment in carbon offset projects for the demand. Singapore has jumped on this growing market via the launch of Climate Impact X, a carbon exchange jointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered Bank, and Temasek.</p><p> Ho Pei Hwa, analyst at DBS Group Research, said that companies developing tools and platforms to make the trading of carbon credits easier and more transparent in the future will be keenly watched. </p><p> Similar to nature-based solutions, reusing and recycling are not new ideas. But the focus now on environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations has created market opportunities in areas such as product redesign and waste management. </p><p> Meghan Sharp, head of Decarbonization Partners -- a joint venture between BlackRock and Temasek that invests in decarbonisation solutions -- said they are looking at an opportunity in the synthetic leather space, where the material is made out of mushrooms. </p><p> Mycellium, which is a part of a fungus from which mushrooms grow, is said to be able to reduce carbon footprint by 5 times as it is bio-degradable. </p><p> Ellen Martin, director of impact and insights at The Circulate Initiative -- the non-profit arm of investment management firm Circulate Capital -- noted that global players such as PepsiCo and Unilever have committed to having all of their plastic packaging be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. \"This in turn creates demand for recycled products and materials and encourages innovations in the waste management space that may not have otherwise been realised,\" she said.</p><p> DBS Group Research said Internet of Things solutions could be used to manage waste collection, whereby devices could be used to sort out waste for efficient recycling. Artificial intelligence could also be utilised to better predict demand for goods and services, so that companies can better manage their inventory to minimise use of resources or wastage. It added that the sharing economy could be digitalised through the development of mobile applications that promote the donation of used items, as well as the repairing and recycling of electronic items. </p><p> An emerging technology-based approach to the circular economy model is the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) capabilities. </p><p> CCUS is a collective term that refers to a range of solutions that essentially allow carbon dioxide, produced through the burning of fossil fuels, to either be stored underground or converted into other useful substances, thereby preventing it from reaching the Earth's atmosphere. According to Ho, CCUS is one of the most cost-effective solutions available for the large-scale reduction of emissions. </p><p> Currently, about 40 million tonnes of carbon is captured each year. However, CCUS deployment must increase by about 140 times for the amount of carbon captured to reach 5.6 Gigatonnes, said the Global CCS Institute. This amount would account for a fifth of emissions reductions needed by 2050.</p><p> Due to Singapore's limited land space, Sarkar pointed out that the use of waste-to-energy plants and CCUS could be key tools in carbon recycling. </p><p> The issues inhibiting the scaling of CCUS are down to costs and uncertainties around its performance. While the technology has been around for decades, it is still considered immature, and the cost to capture and store post-combustion emissions remain very high, said Ho. \"This needs to be resolved through incentivising and ramping up research and development in this field and implementing carbon taxes worldwide. Higher prices of carbon compliance could act as a tipping point towards reaching economies of scale for CCUS technologies.\" </p><p> Making that transitionAccording to a 2021 survey conducted by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 51 per cent of a sample of 51 cities and regions from 21 OECD countries do not yet have a circular economy initiative, though they are planning to. Only 12 per cent indicated that they did not have plans to develop one, while the remaining 37 per cent already have programmes in place. </p><p> Some of the biggest obstacles cited by respondents to transiting to a circular economy include the lack of financing, financial risks, and an inadequate regulatory framework. \"Focusing on a more sustainable way of living has never been more urgent, with global temperatures on the rise, more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and more,\" said DBS Group Research. \"In our view, a circular economy can alleviate the challenges that come about with global warming, though significant progress is still needed.\" </p><p> However, moving from a linear economy to a circular one requires a transformation of global supply chains, and this cannot be accomplished in isolation, said Martin. </p><p> While companies are working with suppliers to pilot new materials and production methods, governments can support the growth of\u00a0circular solutions and influence the way businesses operate through enabling policies such as regulations defining recycled-content requirements, she said. </p><p> \"Policymakers also have the opportunity to facilitate more private investments into the circular economy by introducing financing mechanisms that reduce or share risk,\" added Martin. She also suggested companies can start their transition with small steps before advancing to more significant business model shifts: \"From a product development perspective, companies can look at replacing hard-to-recycle materials such as multi-layer plastic film with more sustainable alternatives. This in turn ensures that end-products can be reintroduced into the economy and are kept out of landfills.\"</p><p> On top of the long-term challenge of mitigating climate change, governments are also tackling other more-present problems, such as supply chain disruptions, energy security concerns and inflation woes. Koh said many will have to reconcile and, in some cases, triage these competing priorities: \"However, there are opportunities to leverage science and technology to help inform government and business decisions on which solutions to prioritise, where to target our actions and how to execute them for maximum benefit while minimising trade-offs.\" </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Rain gardens that help cleanse stormwater run-off, support more native biodiversity and enhance flood protection have been incorporated.

Well over 100,000 people have been subject to mandatory evacuation orders, while early estimates have put the likely insured losses at US$20 billion and the potential overall economic loss as high as US$57 billion. Quantifying the human suffering and emotional loss is impossible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> While the cause of the fires is yet to be established, it is likely that last year's heavy rains from the El Nino weather system fuelled vegetation growth, which has since dried during a recent prolonged dry spell. Combined with strong winds, this has created the ideal conditions for wildfires to spread. </p><p> The broader science is clear -- climate change and today's methods of landscape management are accelerating the wildfire risk globally. </p><p> A key challenge in California -- as also in the Mediterranean, which too has seen a rising threat from wildfires in recent years -- is the rural-urban interface where the town meets the countryside, with a disproportionate number of residences now located in high wildfire-risk areas. </p><p> Holistic strategies neededAs residential areas expand deeper into wilderness, the risk to homes and businesses rises. It is estimated that, globally, insurance claims due to wildfires have risen to US$10 billion annually, a figure that now looks set to be dwarfed in 2025. Indeed, many homeowners caught up in the LA fires are without home insurance, after insurers hiked costs or simply cancelled provision altogether in recent years due to the escalating wildfire risks.</p><p> In addition to urban spread, climate change and the way we plan and manage our landscapes are thought to be the key factors. </p><p> As temperatures rise, and droughts become more frequent, the tinderbox conditions that spark and spread wildfires are increasingly common. </p><p> Across the world, this new generation of wildfires are exceeding our capacity to suppress them. As we face mounting environmental, economic and social threats, we must move from tactical suppression to holistic mitigation-adaptation strategies, to minimise the risk of extreme fires breaking out, and create resilient landscapes that are capable of recovering quickly should a fire occur. </p><p> Recent years have seen substantial scientific and technical advances in how land management practices can integrate prevention-preparedness, detection-response, and restoration-adaptation. </p><p> Climate-smart forestry, for instance, which puts resilience and climate benefits at the forefront of forest management, is emerging as an effective tool for creating landscapes that are resilient to wildfires and other extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. </p><p> One major issue, however, is -- how do we finance these strategies'</p><p> The key to achieving this goal is the growth of the circular bioeconomy -- in essence, by replacing today's extractive, fossil-based economy with an economy based on nature's regenerative power, we can cut the emissions that lead to global heating and reduce the risk of extreme weather events while attracting the necessary investments to transform landscapes and businesses in an integrated manner. At the local level, the bioeconomy flourishes where nature thrives, meaning that economic growth goes hand in hand with the creation of healthy, biodiverse, climate- and fire-resilient landscapes.</p><p> Forests and agroforestry, with their multifunctional roles and wide range of ecosystem services, offer great opportunities to build this new economic model. New technologies are creating unprecedented opportunities to transform plant-based compounds into many of the fossil-based materials we use today, including construction materials, textiles, plastics, and chemicals. Managing forests to produce these resources regeneratively also enhances the ecosystem services that forests provide, improving carbon sequestration, soil health, and water retention, and reducing a forest's susceptibility to fire. </p><p> The same can be said for agroforestry and regenerative farming, which provide us with food while enhancing ecosystem services. </p><p> This is not the case in conventional agriculture, which provides food while generating environmental externalities.</p><p> Seize the opportunity As the bioeconomy grows, so does the economic opportunity. In the Amazon alone, the bioeconomy could be worth up to US$4 trillion, while globally the bioeconomy is expected to be valued at US$7.7 trillion by 2030.</p><p> For investors, the growth of the circular bioeconomy is creating an opportunity for private finance and public-private partnerships to target returns while creating fire-resistant and resilient landscapes through nature-based solutions, such as regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and sustainable forestry, which can target better long-term economic profits and a rise in land values while enhancing biodiversity- and water-, soil- and climate-related ecosystem services. </p><p> Whether this is through companies that are turning monoculture coffee plantations into healthy agroforests, producing coffee that sells at a premium, grown on climate-resilient farms that sequester more carbon than they emit, or carbon and biodiversity credit markets that give investors the chance to target sustainable returns and diversify their portfolios, opportunities abound. However, to bring these and other mechanisms to scale, innovative financial tools will be needed. </p><p> Think out of the boxFrom real asset strategies that deploy capital to transform degraded or non-adapted land assets to resilient and regenerative assets, to schemes such as the Australian Emissions Reduction Fund, and the USA's Forest Resilience Bond -- which allows private capital to play a role in public land management -- such mechanisms must become the norm rather than the exception. </p><p> To do that, the finance industry needs to build a better understanding of the key role of nature as the true engine of our economy. Bringing scientific experts to the investment and finance industry needs to be the norm in the coming years.</p><p> In a world where losses from environmental disasters are growing -- in total, climate disasters cost the global economy US$320 billion in 2024 -- urgent action is needed, and investors have an essential role to play. </p><p> As we search for new ways to finance the fight against wildfires, we must take a multifaceted approach, integrating science, finance and policy to build a circular bioeconomy that addresses the root causes of extreme events. </p><p> In today's era of climate change, we must take our lead from nature and build resilience from the ground up. </p><p> The writer is chief nature officer at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.

(Keppel) announced today that the new Keppel Coastal Trail at Labrador Nature Park is now open to the public. The trail's development is supported by a S$1 million donation from Keppel's philanthropic arm, Keppel Care Foundation, to the Garden City Fund.</p><p>The trail passes through the coastal beach forest habitat, located between Labrador Nature Reserve and the sea and provides visitors with a coastal view as they walk along it. As part of the trail development, the coastal beach forest has undergone active restoration under the Forest Restoration Action Plan. This helps provide a significant physical and ecological buffer for the coastal hill forest within the adjacent Labrador Nature Reserve, one of the last few remaining patches of such habitat on mainland Singapore. The trail offers a new option for nature-based recreation for visitors and more opportunities to get close to biodiversity while boosting the ecological resilience of the nature reserve. The opening of the trail and the continued habitat restoration efforts within Labrador Nature Park are part of Singapore's efforts to transform into a City in Nature, with community stewardship as a key pillar.</p><p>To mark the opening of the trail, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration Mr Desmond Lee, together with Mr Danny Teoh, Chairman of Keppel, Mr Loh Chin Hua, CEO of Keppel, and Keppel Volunteers, joined members of the community in planting 55 native coastal trees along Keppel Coastal Trail.</p><p>Strengthening the ecological resilience of Labrador Nature Reserve</p><p>Keppel Coastal Trail is home to around 100 species of trees and shrubs, including native coastal species such as Ormocarpum cochinchinense, Common Putat (Barringtonia racemosa), and Sea Mango (Cerbera manghas). These species were planted along the trail to increase sources of food and places for fauna to seek shelter. This includes pollinators and dispersers such as birds, bats, and butterflies, potentially increasing the resilience of the adjacent coastal hill forest within the nature reserve.</p><p>In 2020, Keppel pledged to donate S$3 million to plant 10,000 trees in parks and nature reserves in Singapore in support of the OneMillionTrees movement, around half of which are slated to be planted in and around Labrador Nature Reserve. As of end-2024, about 8,000 trees from Keppel's pledge have been planted across Singapore, with around 3,800 trees planted in Labrador Nature Reserve and Labrador Nature Park, including along Keppel Coastal Trail, with the help of over 350 Keppel staff volunteers.</p><p>Enhanced recreational experience for park visitors</p><p>The 340-metre-long trail offers a serene walking experience through Labrador Nature Park, away from more active recreational areas and connects visitors to the jetty at its southern end.</p><p>It comprises two main sections, an approximately 90-metre-long elevated wheelchair-accessible boardwalk which provides unblocked views of the sea from an elevated vantage point, and a 250-metre-long rustic path, which brings visitors through a coastal beach forest habitat. Along the rustic path, three swales which serve as natural drainage solutions for the trail and complementary habitats for fauna, were designed with inputs from youths from NParks' Youth Stewards for Nature (YSN) programme. The youths helped propose the landscape design concept for the swales, taking into consideration the background of the area and ecological and design concepts that were suitable for the site.</p><p>Interpretive signage along the trail provides visitors with information about the biodiversity that can be sighted within the park, including species such as the White-bellied Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), Paradise Tree Snake (Chrysopelea paradisi), and Painted Bronzeback (Dendrelaphis pictus). During the bird migratory season, visitors may even spot birds like the Yellow-rumped Flycatcher (Ficedula zanthopygia) or the Oriental Honey Buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus).</p><p>Mr Danny Teoh, Chairman of Keppel, said, \"The Keppel Coastal Trail reflects our commitment to environmental stewardship, and serves as an important platform for preserving nature and biodiversity in Labrador Nature Reserve, while strengthening its ecological resilience. Keppel will continue to support the efforts of Singapore and the international community to address the challenges posed by climate change, including through nature-based solutions.\"</p><p>\"We are deeply grateful to Keppel for their generous contribution towards the development of Keppel Coastal Trail and the forest restoration efforts at Labrador Nature Reserve and Labrador Nature Park. Their support has enabled the creation of a trail that allows the community to learn about these vital coastal forests and their crucial role in mitigating climate change impacts. While this is a significant step forward, there is still much work to be done to protect and enhance our natural environment. We hope that more organisations and individuals will be inspired to step forward and play their part in leaving a living legacy for future generations,\" said Mr Guy Daniel Harvey-Samuel, Chairman of Garden City Fund.</p><p>Enhancing parks in the southern region to provide more nature-based recreation opportunities</p><p>The completion of the trail complements efforts to transform Labrador Nature Park into a Destination Park, with its own thematic identity and unique features. Labrador Nature Park, together with HortPark and West Coast Park, were previously identified to be enhanced into Destination Parks, and are part of a larger cluster of 13 parks in Singapore's southwestern region. These will be enhanced to expand the variety of experiences for visitors of all ages in the Southern Ridges and west coast and offer the public greater access to recreational features set amidst nature.</p><p>One of these parks is Pasir Panjang Park, which stretches from West Coast Park to Pasir Panjang. NParks will be enhancing the park further by adding a node to the park, at the former industrial waterfront of the Pasir Panjang Power District. This new park node will complement the rejuvenation of the Power District. The node will add around 2 ha to Pasir Panjang Park, expanding it from 6 ha to 8 ha. When completed, the extended Pasir Panjang Park will link other green spaces via the Park Connector Network to Labrador Nature Park. These include West Coast Park, Jurong Lake Gardens and Jurong Central Park. NParks will be calling for the tender for the detailed design consultancy this year to welcome proposals for this park node.</p><p>These are all part of NParks' efforts to transform Singapore into a City in Nature, where we bring people closer to nature, while bolstering the ecological resilience of our habitats.</p><p>[Category: Investment Banking &amp; Brokerage, Financial/ Capital Market, Business Expansion, Regulatory and Legal]</p><p>Source: National Parks Board,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["During the bird migratory season, visitors may even spot birds like the Yellow-rumped Flycatcher (Ficedula zanthopygia) or the Oriental Honey Buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus).

Industry experts shared with The Business Times that their outlook for Singapore's reinsurance sector remains optimistic, citing favourable conditions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Singapore Reinsurers' Association chair Kenrick Law attributes his optimism to several factors such as the country's supportive regulatory environment, proactive policies aimed at attracting and retaining global reinsurers, and its growing focus on green financing and climate risk management.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Developing talentHe emphasised that the government's regulations promoting transparency, risk management and compliance will continue to attract more global reinsurers to the market. Additionally, the government's focus on developing both local and international talent has enhanced the Republic's appeal as a reinsurance hub.</p><p> \"This, coupled with its stable political environment and well-established financial ecosystem, (provides) a strong foundation for reinsurers looking to establish their regional headquarters or expand their operations,\" he explained. </p><p> In 2023, Singapore's reinsurance premiums grew 31 per cent year on year to S$27.6 billion, accounting for approximately 21 per cent of Asia's reinsurance market. Although figures for 2024 are not yet available, the momentum is expected to have continued.</p><p> Chris Lim, associate director at credit rating agency AM Best, highlighted that the country benefits from a \"strategically advantageous geographical location within Asia-Pacific\" which allows Singapore-domiciled reinsurers to transact overseas easily.</p><p> \"Vibrant ecosystem\"\"Singapore is a well-established insurance and reinsurance hub, made up of a vibrant ecosystem of reinsurance players, reinsurance brokers and other financial service providers,\" he added.</p><p> Currently, the Republic serves as the Asia-Pacific headquarters for 12 of the world's top global insurers and reinsurers. Among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 have established their regional hubs in Singapore, covering markets in Asean, North and South Asia, as well as Australia.</p><p> More specialty insurers and international insurance firms are choosing the city-state as their regional hub, noted Justin Ward, managing director of Asia-Pacific capital advisory at reinsurance specialist Guy Carpenter. He likened Singapore's strategic position to that of London in Europe and New York in North America.</p><p> For example, Ward said, Singapore serves as the hub for Guy Carpenter's South-east Asia and South Korea operations.</p><p> The company follows a hub-and-spoke model, with smaller offices in Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea, but Singapore remains central for key functions such as actuarial services, capital management, market strategy and client management. He added that this strategic focus has allowed the firm to effectively deploy capabilities and attract offshore business to the Republic.</p><p> Ward foresees that reinsurers will increasingly focus on strengthening their capabilities in the Singapore market this year.</p><p> He said: \"We see a concerted effort (by) the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore government to ensure that Singapore may remain at the forefront of insurance and reinsurance innovation in the region. We don't see that abating. We see that increasing speed post-Covid and (with) further innovation coming through.\"</p><p> Deputy Prime Minister and MAS chairman Gan Kim Yong noted that the Singapore government has committed to doubling down on developing a marketplace of insurers and reinsurers, in a speech at last year's Singapore International Reinsurance Conference (SIRC).</p><p> He added that the government will also work with insurers and reinsurers in the city-state to deepen their capabilities, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p> \"Through strengthening our insurance ecosystem, deepening capabilities, including in AI, and developing alternative risk transfer markets in Asia, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub,\" he said.</p><p> Victor Kuk, head of property and casualty reinsurance for South-east Asia, India, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan at Swiss Re, pointed out that Singapore's stable political and financial environment is another incentive for many companies to conduct business activities here.</p><p> With Singapore being a gateway for many businesses to international as well as South-east Asian markets, the firm can leverage this unique geographic location to support its clients throughout the region more effectively, he added.</p><p> Looking at recent regulatory developments in Singapore, Kuk anticipates that these will help \"position the reinsurance industry for long-term resilience\" and bring about \"an opportunity for the market to align with global standards\".</p><p> Last August, the MAS imposed stricter oversight for insurers with reinsurance contracts, requiring them to submit terms and conditions for review, with the possibility of audits.</p><p> This move followed a report from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, which raised concerns about the growing allocation of capital to alternative assets and the increasing use of cross-border, asset-intensive reinsurance.</p><p> Alternative risk transferSingapore has been focusing on expanding its insurance capacity through alternative risk transfer instruments, such as sovereign insurance solutions and insurance-linked securities (ILS). </p><p> ILS are financial instruments tied to risks such as natural disasters, specialty insurance risks, and life and health insurance. They provide an alternative way for insurers and reinsurers to transfer large risks to capital-market investors.</p><p> Gan previously noted that the government is supporting the development of ILS markets in Asia to increase the available financial capacity for covering major catastrophe risks, especially since Asia currently represents less than 5 per cent of the global catastrophe bond market.</p><p> To further these efforts, MAS is collaborating with the ILS industry to promote these instruments as an asset class for private wealth and investment portfolios, in a drive to channel growing investments from both private wealth and institutional investors in Asia into ILS.</p><p> Among the most well-known forms of ILS are catastrophe bonds -- or cat bonds -- which transfer specific risks, usually from natural disasters, from sponsors to capital-market investors. </p><p> Cat bonds are becoming increasingly important as they help address protection gaps that are widening, due to the growing impact of climate change, when traditional insurance coverage is often insufficient. </p><p> Currently, there are 14 ILS listed on the Singapore Exchange, including cat bonds issued by global specialty insurer and reinsurer MS Amlin Asia Pacific.</p><p> Guy Carpenter's Ward, however, stressed the need for greater interest in ILS from asset managers in Singapore and the wider region, which would contribute to a more vibrant alternative risk transfer market.</p><p> \"What will be interesting, moving forward, is how we continue to gain momentum around alternative sources of capital that can be made available to reinsurers and insurers, whether through the presence of fund managers (or) the insurance sector's focus on ILS, and how that will change the sources of capital available for insurers and reinsurers.\" </p><p> Climate transition in Asia is expected to drive growing demand for reinsurance, creating significant opportunities that Singapore can leverage.</p><p> Catastrophe coverageWhile the region is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, it also faces a significant protection gap, particularly in terms of catastrophe coverage. In 2023, economic losses in the Asia-Pacific region totalled US$65 billion, with 91 per cent of these losses uninsured, compared with a 30 per cent protection gap in the US.</p><p> Kuk of Swiss Re highlighted that climate change will lead to an increased risk of natural catastrophes across Asia-Pacific, particularly in coastal areas and urban centres located in flood-prone river zones.</p><p> \"Protective measures need to be taken for insurance products to remain economical for such properties at high risk,\" he said.</p><p> He added that the reinsurance industry plays an important role in building resilience before an event strikes through mitigation efforts as well as after, especially in emerging markets at risk of natural catastrophes and where insurance penetration may not be as high.</p><p> Gan noted in his SIRC speech that Singapore's focus on sustainable finance and green insurance products has further positioned the country as a preferred hub for reinsurers, particularly as the sector confronts climate-related risks.</p><p> \"With the country actively building its research on physical impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, climate-impact modelling and nature-based solutions, reinsurers can leverage these insights to improve their risk assessment models, portfolio management strategies and climate disclosures,\" he said.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["He added that the reinsurance industry plays an important role in building resilience before an event strikes through mitigation efforts as well as after, especially in emerging markets at risk of natural catastrophes and where insurance penetration may not be as high.

Devan Nair, 43, heads down to her void deck three to four times a day to seek reprieve from the still air of her home.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> She lives in a one-room rental flat in Bukit Merah with her grandmother and several cats.

I'm asthmatic, and attacks are triggered during the hot weather,\" added Ms Subasheny, a former security guard who is currently unemployed. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As Singapore and the broader Asia region enter the warmest months of the year, which are typically from April to June, Ms Subasheny could be making more frequent trips to her void deck to enjoy the outdoor breeze. </p><p> Fuelled by climate change, temperatures are rising globally. </p><p> The year 2024 has been declared the hottest year on record, and temperatures are expected to continue rising as planet-warming emissions go up. </p><p> But heat does not impact all segments of society in the same way, especially for those who have no easy access to air-conditioning. </p><p> Some, like Ms Subasheny, have health conditions that are triggered by rising temperatures. </p><p> In other parts of the region, outdoor workers, women and people living in informal settlements will also be susceptible to indirect impacts of heat that make their experience in a warmer world worse. </p><p> For example, heat stress affects outdoor and factory workers' productivity, and can lead to workplace accidents. </p><p> Now, a growing number of organisations -- including research groups, humanitarian organisations and multilateral banks -- are trying to understand how heat is experienced by various segments of society. </p><p> New solutions are also being rolled out, to help vulnerable members of the community keep their cool. </p><p> Monitoring the heat experienceIn February, two researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) visited Ms Subasheny's home, armed with a handheld weather station -- which measures things like temperature and wind speed -- and a 360-degree camera. </p><p> Their aim is to find out how her household is impacted by the heat, and how the occupants cope with the discomfort. </p><p> While local studies have been done on the heat risk of construction workers and soldiers, this is the first time researchers are heading into homes to find out if residents and their living spaces are resilient to hotter weather and humidity. </p><p> For smaller units, placing a fan near the window could optimise air circulation, and keeping heat sources away from the living room area could help, SUTD's Assistant Professor Samuel Chng said. </p><p> Prof Chng, the study's principal investigator, said of the research: \"People spend at least 10 hours a day in their own homes. So how do we make it as comfortable as possible? The end goal is to help residents adapt well to rising heat.\" </p><p>Ms Subasheny's flat is one of more than 300 HDB units islandwide that the researchers have visited since September 2024. The aim is to survey 500 HDB flats in total under the research project. </p><p> The eventual goal is to come up with a menu of low-cost, yet effective, cooling options -- beyond air-conditioning -- that are accessible to all. </p><p> This could be as simple as switching from polyester bedsheets to cotton ones, which offer more cooling, said Prof Chng. Cotton bedsheets feel cooler than polyester sheets mainly due to differences in breathability, moisture absorption and heat retention. </p><p> He co-leads the four-year study, which started in 2023 and also involves the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore-ETH Centre, spanning two fieldwork projects. The project involving the 500 households is funded by the Social Science Research Council. </p><p> Concurrently, the second project involves tracking the thermal comfort of residents for two weeks, while documenting the measures they take to stay cool. Of the 100 households covered in this project, half of them will be rental flats, and this portion is funded by the Tote Board.  </p><p> In the first project, participating residents are surveyed on a range of things, from the size of their utility bills to their perceptions on whether heat has worsened their moods or existing health conditions. </p><p> Researchers also conduct a home audit where they scrutinise features that could influence the dwellers' exposure to heat, from the type of flooring to the types of lights used. </p><p> For example, fluorescent lights emit more heat than LED lights and a house that is heavily cluttered would block wind flow. The data is further analysed so researchers can measure wind flow patterns within the flats. </p><p> In Ms Subasheny's home, the researchers measured indoor temperatures, humidity and wind speed, which are plotted against a thermal comfort standard, which defines the acceptable range of conditions of thermal comfort for building occupants. </p><p> They found that the air temperature was 30.1 deg C -- warmer than the 28.7 deg C outdoors. Humidity indoors was 71 per cent. Her home also had no air flow -- since the windows are kept closed to keep the cats indoors -- except for her bed which has two standing fans pointed at it. </p><p> Overall, her home did not meet thermal comfort standards. </p><p> The researchers observed that older rental units like hers also tend to have lower ceilings. For these flats, it is more challenging to install ceiling fans which circulate air more effectively than stand fans, said Prof Chng. </p><p> The situation in Ms Subasheny's home, where it is hotter indoors than out, has also been detected elsewhere. </p><p> \"During some visits, we found some homes to be warmer than the outside. That's quite worrying. Outside was about 25 deg C and inside was 30.1 deg C,\" said Prof Chng, who is from SUTD's Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities. </p><p> Air-conditioning can exacerbate the warming problem. </p><p> The researchers said that the excessive use of air-conditioning further contributes to global warming due to the release of planet-warming refrigerants, and worsens the urban heat island effect. This refers to the phenomenon where urban areas are warmer than rural areas, as buildings and roads retain heat, and vehicles and air-cons emit waste heat.  </p><p> \"Adaptation to thermal comfort and urban heat does not necessarily mean you need to turn on the air-con,\" said Dr Zheng Kai, one of the co-leads of the research and a lecturer in the architecture and sustainable design pillar at SUTD.</p><p> Prof Chng added: \"We don't want to make air-conditioning the villain, it is a great invention. But how do we use it responsibly? When should we use it'\"</p><p> From push to shove Elsewhere in Asia, where temperatures can soar to over 40 deg C -- a town in Myanmar experienced 48.2 deg C days in April 2024 -- heat can be a double whammy for some communities. </p><p> This is because not only do they have to deal with the threat of scorching temperatures but they also face other factors like socio-economic status and cultural gender expectations which can make their situation worse. </p><p> Mr Mohammad Shahjahan, from the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, said rickshaw drivers, street hawkers and slum dwellers were among those hardest hit by the relentless heatwave that affected the South Asian country in April 2024.</p><p> Temperatures across Bangladesh exceeded 42 deg C during the month-long heatwave -- the country's worst in 76 years. Fifteen deaths directly linked to the heat were reported, although many other casualties could have slipped under the radar.  </p><p> Rickshaw pullers, street hawkers and those in informal trades, who are usually able to work for more than 10 hours a day, could be on the ground for only up to six hours before the heat took a toll on them, said Mr Shahjahan. </p><p> Excessive sweating and dehydration caused the outdoor workers to seek drinking water from unhygienic sources such as municipality waterlines and ponds, which were not properly purified. </p><p> This led to a rise in waterborne diseases as well, added Mr Shahjahan, who is the assistant director and coordinator of the anticipatory action technical working group. </p><p> Workers whose jobs require them to be outdoors all day, such as street vendors or agricultural workers, are also highly susceptible to heat stress, which can lead to heat-related illness or lower their productivity.</p><p> They also tend to press on during periods of excessive heat, since not working means a loss of income. </p><p> For female workers who have caregiving duties to fulfil, knocking off work does not mean they get to rest. </p><p>Ms Zonibel Woods, senior social development specialist at the Asian Development Bank (ADB), told The Straits Times that women are often responsible for fetching water, cooking and caring for children and elderly family members. </p><p> During hot periods, they also face higher workloads as they have to help manage the household's cooling needs, care for sick relatives and cope with water shortage. </p><p> In the city of Kampot in Southern Cambodia, where Kampot pepper is a vital economic crop, heatwaves destroy yields and threaten farmers' livelihoods.</p><p> More than 60 per cent of the pepper farmers are women, many of whom are affected by heat stress, according to Banteay Srei, a Cambodian non-governmental organisation working with vulnerable women and rural communities. </p><p>Ms Phearong Sdeung, executive director at Banteay Srei, said: \"They notice that they find it hard to breathe, feel stressed and have a headache when it is hot... However, they keep working hard regardless of the temperatures.\"</p><p> Beating the heat Amid growing awareness of the need to protect vulnerable members of society from rising temperatures, new solutions are being developed to help protect these groups. </p><p> These solutions range from the roll-out of new technology, to the development of new financial instruments, such as heat insurance. </p><p> In Cambodia, for example, Banteay Srei is working with other groups to pilot a solar-powered cooling and drip irrigation system that can help farmers reduce losses of their Kampot pepper crops. </p><p> The system, which uses sprinkler techniques and a more water-efficient irrigation, helps to lower surrounding temperatures and reduce farmers' working hours under the extreme heat. </p><p> Organisations like ADB are also tapping more innovative forms of protection from heat such as parametric insurance, which is a type of insurance that triggers coverage payout if and when predefined event parameters are met or exceeded. </p><p> This is different from traditional insurance products, which require assessments of individual damage before payouts are made. For example, for a heat parametric insurance, pre-determined payouts are triggered when certain temperature thresholds are breached. </p><p> \"Unlike typhoons or floods, heatwaves do not cause visible destruction which makes it difficult to claim losses,\" said Ms Woods from ADB.</p><p> \"The trigger for payouts would be determined based on historical weather patterns and local climate risks, to guarantee that the system reflects conditions most relevant to affected communities,\" said Ms Woods. </p><p> ADB is looking to implement these policies for female informal workers, such as farmers and outdoor workers, who often suffer income loss during extreme heat events. </p><p> Pilot programmes are slated to be rolled out later in 2025 in Bangladesh, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, though the scheme is still being researched and developed, Ms Woods added. </p><p> While payout amounts have yet to be determined, the insurance is designed to offset short-term income loss or provide immediate financial relief to help women avoid precarious working conditions.</p><p> Since many informal workers often do not have traditional insurance, ADB will team up with local groups, including women's organisations and social support networks, to find ways to develop a model that makes parametric insurance accessible, Ms Woods added.</p><p> ADB will also look at how to make the insurance premiums affordable such as through subsidies or partnerships with the government and private insurers. </p><p> In August 2024, a heatwave parametric insurance for outdoor workers was rolled out by insurance firm AXA Hong Kong and Macau, in what the insurance provider called a market-first. </p><p> AXA said it introduced the heatwave parametric insurance to provide benefits for heat stress prevention and to protect affected practitioners. </p><p> Policyholders would receive a payout of HK$100 (S$17) or an \"anti-heatwave kit\" of equivalent value if temperatures exceeded 36 deg C for three consecutive days between August and October in 2024. </p><p> The premium was HK$19.90 per person and insured individuals would not have to prove damage or loss and were not required to apply for additional claims or submit claim forms and supporting documents to receive the payout, according to the release.</p><p> Taking action early Other than just reacting to heatwaves when they happen, the movement for governments to have in place early action plans and early warning systems is also picking up steam. </p><p> In 2022, the UN launched its Early Warnings for All initiative which aims for every person on earth to be protected by early warning systems by 2027. </p><p> The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has also highlighted the urgency for countries to develop early action plans against the heat crisis. Such a plan would require some details to be worked out, including defining what a heatwave is, and developing a threshold for when early action plans kick in. </p><p> Such early preparation can warn communities of an impending heatwave, which can help to reduce deaths and economic losses when disasters strike. </p><p> One early action plan was rolled out by the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society in Dhaka city, primarily, in the April 2024 heatwave. </p><p> The society activated the early action plan on April 21 for Dhaka city as it was forecast that the temperature threshold of at least 38 deg C over two consecutive days would be reached from April 28 to 30. The society also reached out to more than 20 severely impacted districts, covering over 400,000 people.  </p><p> The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society activated 250 volunteers to help distribute umbrellas, caps and bottles of water to vulnerable groups, such as rickshaw pullers and street hawkers. </p><p> Three makeshift cooling centres were set up, each equipped with six stand fans, water and paramedics, in case people were coming in with heat exhaustion. </p><p> The Red Crescent Society also secured funds to distribute cash to 4,000 families in informal settlements. </p><p> Each household received 5,000 Bangladeshi taka (S$55) to tide them over the month and compensate for their loss in income, so they would not have to work outdoors in the heat. In those families, persons with disabilities received another 2,500 Bangladeshi taka. </p><p> However, Mr Shahjahan felt that the society has only scratched the surface with the cash distribution.</p><p> \"We provided support, but it was not enough because we provided for only 4,000 households. Dhaka is a mega-city,\" he said. Dhaka has more than 5,000 slums with more than four million inhabitants. </p><p> The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society is working with various agencies to develop a national-level heatwave early action plan. </p><p> While early action plans can help to avert a crisis before a heatwave hits, taking a long-term view of the crisis is also critical, experts say. </p><p> \"It's not just about having an emergency response. It's also being prepared for it, introducing adaptation measures and actions for extreme heat,\" said ADB's Ms Woods. </p><p> \"The heat action plans we develop need to look at the short-, medium- and long- term interventions that need to be taken to build the resilience of countries, communities and sectors to increasing temperatures.\"</p><p> For example, a long-term heat action plan may see the incorporation of green spaces and nature-based solutions in a city where the urban heat island effect is prevalent, Ms Woods said.</p><p>Singapore, for example, is moving on this front, with its City in Nature ambitions to infuse more greenery into the city. </p><p> By 2030, all HDB estates will also be coated with heat-reflective paint, that has shown to be able to reduce ambient temperatures by up to 2 deg C. </p><p> SUTD's Prof Chng acknowledged that Singapore has good urban planning practices and design that can mitigate some impacts of heat among urban dwellers. </p><p> But his team's ongoing research has shown that at the household-level, some families could be disproportionately affected by rising temperatures.</p><p> He said: \"We shouldn't take our eyes off the heat. It's very likely that it's a warming world that we are living in. So how do we help residents in Singapore adapt better'\"</p><p> \"Our research focuses on how people can adapt in a sustainable manner in your own homes.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["It's also being prepared for it, introducing adaptation measures and actions for extreme heat,\" said ADB's Ms Woods. \"The heat action plans we develop need to look at the short-, medium- and long- term interventions that need to be taken to build the resilience of countries, communities and sectors to increasing temperatures.

Or the role played by forests as sources of water for city reservoirs. Pollinators, including bees and butterflies, are also vital for crops. In South-east Asia, bats are important pollinators of the durian, the region's spiky delicacy. </p><p> As Ms Jan Yoshioka, vice-president of sustainable finance at non-profit organisation Conservation International's (CI) Asia-Pacific region, put it: \"It is in the self-interest of corporations to adopt environmentally and socially sustainable business practices and to invest in the conservation of the natural resources they depend on.\" </p><p> The realisation that healthy natural ecosystems are key to thriving businesses has put new wind in the sails of the nature conservation movement, widening the circle of those involved beyond just conservationists and governments to include the private sector too. </p><p> Mr Carlos Pagoaga, president of the Coca-Cola Foundation, said nature often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed health and reducing water stress for communities.</p><p> \"The Coca-Cola Foundation, the Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners invest in nature-based solutions, such as forest protection and floodplain management, which build on natural processes to manage water systems,\" he told The Straits Times. </p><p> \"Through this work, we recognise that nature-based solutions often have multiple co-benefits, such as better water quality, carbon sequestration, increased climate resilience, and enhanced richness and variety of life of natural habitats,\" Mr Pagoaga added.</p><p> Do more with nature-based solutionsWhile the intention to contribute to nature's restoration is there, the question is how companies can do so in a more sustained manner than a one-time donation in the name of corporate social responsibility. </p><p> Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Singapore, said: \"In our current market environment, in order to ensure better conservation, we either have to put a price on nature or make it a rule -- or both.\"</p><p> Mr Sivaprasad, who is BCG's South-east Asia lead for climate and sustainability, added: \"This means defining the economic value of things like clean water, air, food security, carbon storage that are enabled by nature and/or creating government regulations that make conservation a requirement.\"</p><p> The close links between the climate and biodiversity crises mean that some financial instruments developed to help companies address climate change are also having positive effects on nature. </p><p> This is most clearly seen in the carbon markets. </p><p> Habitats such as forests and mangroves have the ability to sequester carbon -- or capture and store planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This locks the carbon away from the atmosphere, contributing to climate mitigation. </p><p> One carbon credit represents 1 tonne of planet-warming greenhouse gases that is either prevented from being released, such as when a forest is saved from the axe, or removed from the atmosphere, such as through a forest restoration project.</p><p> Mr Law Heng Dean, managing director of the Singapore office of the Pollination Group, a global climate change investment and advisory firm, said that nature-based solutions to sequester carbon or prevent it from being emitted in the first place could contribute to around 30 per cent of global mitigation needed to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement. </p><p> Companies buy carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint so that they can meet their commitments of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 -- the timeline that could help the world avoid the harshest impacts of climate change, according to the UN's climate science body. </p><p> CI's Ms Yoshioka said a key driver of the increased interest shown by the private sector in nature is its demand for nature-based carbon credits. </p><p> And when companies buy carbon credits to meet their climate targets, nature reaps the dividends: In one area, a forest is saved from the axe. In another, a mangrove is restored. </p><p> Amid the growing consensus that the world cannot achieve net-zero emissions without nature-based solutions, private and public sectors are becoming increasingly involved in nature conservation, said Ms Hoon Ling Min, investment director at investment firm GenZero.</p><p> But between 2010 and 2022, voluntary carbon markets managed to unlock only a fraction of the potential of nature-based solutions, said Pollination's Mr Law. </p><p> Figures from Ecosystem Marketplace, a global environmental finance news and markets analysis site, show that the global voluntary carbon market was worth about US$2 billion in 2022. </p><p> This is nowhere near the US$700 billion the UN says is required every year for nature's protection. </p><p> For the nature funding gap to be narrowed, the private sector needs to be motivated to loosen their purse strings further.</p><p> \"Today, more than 80 per cent of finance to nature comes from public sources; private financing, whether by corporates or financial institutions, remains an under-tapped source,\" Mr Law noted.</p><p> Can companies be convinced that investing in nature is not just about meeting regulatory requirements or avoiding potential losses, but that it could actually help to turn a profit too? </p><p> People, profit and planet As nature's true value -- to lives, livelihoods and bottom lines -- starts to come into focus, attempts are now being made to put a price on nature. </p><p> This ability to capture value in instruments that can be invested in and traded is what the financial sector excels in, said GenZero's Ms Hoon. </p><p> Take, for example, the World Bank's rhino bond, which was issued in 2022 to increase the population of the critically endangered black rhinoceros, native to Africa. </p><p> The five-year US$150 million bond -- the first wildlife conservation bond of its kind -- will pay investors returns based on the rate of growth of black rhino populations at South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park and the Great Fish River Nature Reserve.</p><p> The bond was sold to institutional investors, such as investment firm Nuveen and Mackenzie Investments, and high-net-worth clients from Credit Suisse International and Citi private banking arms. </p><p> Similarly, a newly proposed Indonesia Coral Bond -- another initiative of the World Bank -- will see investors receiving a \"success payment\" at maturity.</p><p> Mr Helge Muenkel, chief sustainability officer at DBS Bank, said: \"Beyond providing essential funding, financial expertise is instrumental in developing innovative financial products that can support nature-based solutions.\"</p><p> Another instrument gaining traction is biodiversity credits.</p><p> These credits come from projects that seek to provide measurable improvements in biodiversity, be they focused on a specific species or across an entire ecosystem.</p><p> The credit is a certificate that a corporate buys representing a specific outcome, such as a measurable improvement to a hectare of forest over 10 years. </p><p> For example, Colombian project developer Terrasos has issued credits that each represents the protection of 10 sq m of conserved or restored ecosystems in a high-conservation area of Colombia for 30 years. </p><p> \"Governments are interested in leveraging biodiversity credits as a mechanism to help drive private sector investment into positive outcomes for nature,\" said Ms Laura Waterford, executive director at the Pollination Group in Australia. </p><p> Corporates and financial institutions were also starting to think about buying biodiversity credits on a voluntary basis as part of their broader nature strategies, she added.  </p><p> Ultimately, the goal is to have a global market in tradeable biodiversity credits, though this will take some more time, given the complexity of measuring the benefits. Ms Waterford said the foundations for effective voluntary biodiversity credit markets could be in place by 2030. </p><p> The pricing complex The emergence of innovative financial instruments like rhino bonds can help to unlock new sources of funding from the private sector for nature's conservation, since firms now have a financial -- not just regulatory -- incentive to do so. </p><p> But these tend to be project-specific, and are challenging to implement on a wider scale. </p><p> Observers point to a few obstacles to scaling them up: the difficulty in measuring impact; the uniqueness and complexities of each and every ecosystem, which makes it difficult to develop replicable models that can be implemented quickly across different regions; and the difference in timelines for nature's recovery against investor expectations. </p><p> \"Where there is a globally agreed upon unit for measuring emissions, reductions and removals, there is currently no common unit of measurement for nature and biodiversity,\" said CI's Ms Yoshioka. </p><p> For carbon credit projects, the unit of measure appears to be straightforward. </p><p> Closing down a coal plant in favour of a solar farm prevents the release of a quantifiable amount of carbon dioxide. </p><p> But developments over the past two years have shown that even the suggestion that a carbon project will not truly deliver climate benefits -- such as carbon credits sold for protecting a forest that was at low risk of being cut down in the first place -- can send carbon markets into turmoil, as buyers fear accusations of greenwashing and reputational backlash. </p><p> This has triggered a major shift towards stronger standards and methodologies that back only high-quality carbon projects -- a much-needed reset for the market, experts say. </p><p> Measuring the impacts of a conservation initiative is much more complicated. </p><p> For example, should the focus be across an entire ecosystem or habitat or specific species? Or should protecting what is left be prioritised, over restoring the degraded parts of the land? </p><p> DBS' Mr Muenkel pointed to how nature conservation projects are influenced by unique cultural, societal and environmental factors. </p><p> Restoring a mangrove in Indonesia, for example, would be vastly different from doing the same in India or Colombia, owing to different species compositions, different drivers of deforestation, different environmental conditions and so on. </p><p> Yet, being able to measure outcomes of conservation interventions will be critical to get investor buy-in. </p><p> \"Scientific robustness, impact measurement and risk management are some of the key factors considered by private entities and financial institutions before making a decision on biodiversity-linked financial products,\" Mr Muenkel said.</p><p> Monitoring mechanisms are also needed to measure the impact of conservation efforts, and independent third-party verification processes help to prevent greenwashing and manage any related reputational risks, he added. </p><p> The Coca-Cola Company, for example, said it is partnering with other organisations to develop a methodology to help it quantify and test the co-benefits of nature-based projects, which can help to provide a means to value social return on investment. This, said a spokesperson, can help to build the business case for nature-based solutions. </p><p> This is all part of efforts by academic institutions, companies and standards bodies to develop common frameworks to govern biodiversity investments to ensure they boost nature, can bring social benefits and that this can be measured and verified. </p><p> Further complicating the situation is that nature's progress is oblivious to investor timelines. </p><p> Mr Mike Ng, group chief sustainability officer at OCBC Bank, said: \"Some nature-related projects also come with long timelines and uncertainty, which may require longer financing timelines than traditional loan tenures. These factors contribute to the lack of bankability for nature conservation projects globally.\" </p><p> A coral reef, for example, can take up to 10,000 years to develop. As the reef accretes, habitat complexity deepens -- providing creatures like shrimp, baby fish and flatworms -- with nooks and crannies to hide and rest in. </p><p> But if that reef is destroyed by trawling or bomb fishing, and reef restoration efforts are needed to help it recover, how long would it take to restore the life that it once held? </p><p> Overcoming roadblocks Despite -- or perhaps because of -- these challenges, new schemes that attempt to put a price on nature continue to bloom. </p><p> One area being explored is to leverage the success of the carbon market and tie biodiversity benefits more closely to carbon financing. </p><p> Carbon credit projects have benefited nature and developing nations for decades, said Mr Duncan van Bergen, co-founder of Calyx Global, which rates carbon credit projects. </p><p> He added that recent innovations focusing on shoring up the climate integrity of credits will help the market scale up, \"maximising its impact and enabling companies to participate with greater assurance\". </p><p> In other words, buyers want to be certain that credits can hold up to scrutiny. Add in nature and social benefits, such as health and education support for local communities, and it is a winning combination. </p><p> For any land-based carbon project, it is now mandatory to include biodiversity and community components, said Mr Pablo Fernandez, chief executive of ecosecurities, a global carbon project developer and advisory firm. </p><p> TNC and its Indonesian partner, Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara, are studying a project concept in East Kalimantan on Borneo island that would conserve a large area of forest but also generate money to compensate several land concession owners. </p><p> Revenue would come from sustainable timber production, carbon credits and payments for biodiversity conservation. </p><p> \"It is hard to change the behaviours in the landscape, whether that is corporate behaviour or a small holder or a government if you are not bringing a viable financial alternative to the table,\" said Mr Will McGoldrick, TNC's managing director for the Asia-Pacific. </p><p> Also in Indonesia, a new effort between CI and its local partner, Yayasan Konservasi Indonesia, aims to combine marine conservation with sustainable fishery practices under its Blue Halo S initiative. </p><p> A grant funding mechanism under the initiative, to be implemented from 2025 to 2031, has received interest from private sector groups, including fisheries and aquaculture technology start-ups, business incubators and impact investors. </p><p> CI's Ms Yoshioka said: \"The (grant facility) aims to improve the climate resilience of around 162,000 Indonesian coastal communities while contributing to the sequestration of more than half a million tonnes of... emissions through restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangrove and seagrass, and improved management of marine protected areas.\"</p><p> Another idea to bridge commercial returns with societal benefits is that of ecotourism, said BCG's Ms Alia Kaz, a knowledge expert in sustainability. </p><p> Scientists, ecologists and organisations involved in nature conservation usually focus on improving a public good. \"They are often funded on the basis of grants with no or limited expectation of economic return. Their work results in societal returns, not commercial returns,\" she said. </p><p> \"But individuals in the private sector and financial sector are measured on commercial returns,\" Ms Kaz added. \"Nature conservation can generate ecotourism and ecotourism-related revenues.\"</p><p> Reining in destructionIncreasing funding for nature conservation, however, is just one part of the picture. </p><p> Figures show that the world is spending much more on activities that damage nature. For one thing, subsidies that drive the destruction of nature -- such as tax breaks and cheap diesel that fail to account for the cost of environmental damage from the fossil fuel, agriculture, water and forestry sectors -- amount to an estimated US$1.8 trillion, a study in 2022 found.</p><p> Activities that cause harm to nature and the subsidies they receive must also be re-evaluated, said Dr Francesco Ricciardi, an environmental specialist working at a developmental organisation. </p><p> Speaking in his personal capacity, Dr Ricciardi said he is doubtful the market can solve environmental issues, since much of nature's degradation is the result of the pursuit for economic growth. </p><p> \"Mining, building roads in pristine rainforests to push mining and logging interests, constructing large dams that bring fish to extinction, these are all still happening now in a bid for more economic growth,\" he said. </p><p> The global reckoning of the value of nature must also consider that the cost of destroying nature -- whether it be clearing a forest for a plantation, discharging pollution into a freshwater stream or spilling oil into the ocean -- is no longer free.</p><p> To move the nature needle, said TNC's Mr McGoldrick, the right regulatory environment is critical. </p><p> \"You have to get the government policy settings right to both incentivise the right type of investment, but also limit or prevent the wrong type of investment,\" he added. </p><p> Where the private sector can come in is in the realm of innovation.</p><p> Dr Alfredo Giron Nava, head of the Ocean Action Agenda at the World Economic Forum, said: \"We cannot achieve the scale needed to increase financing for nature without the private sector. There simply isn't enough development or philanthropic money.\" </p><p> What is needed is a common language between the profit-driven motives of the private sector and conservationists, he added.</p><p> \"Our job is to come up with realistic models, and collaborate with one another to create them, to show that there can be models that are good for nature, are good for business too,\" said Dr Nava. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The realisation that healthy natural ecosystems are key to thriving businesses has put new wind in the sails of the nature conservation movement, widening the circle of those involved beyond just conservationists and governments to include the private sector too.

Industry experts shared with The Business Times that their outlook for Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinsurance sector remains optimistic, citing favourable conditions.Singapore Reinsurers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association chair Kenrick Law attributes his optimism to several factors such as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supportive regulatory environment, proactive policies aimed at attracting and retaining global reinsurers, and its growing focus on green financing and climate risk management.He emphasised that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regulations promoting transparency, risk management and compliance will continue to attract more global reinsurers to the market.Additionally, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on developing both local and international talent has enhanced the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal as a reinsurance hub.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This, coupled with its stable political environment and well-established financial ecosystem, (provides) a strong foundation for reinsurers looking to establish their regional headquarters or expand their operations,\u00e2\u20ac he explained.In 2023, Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinsurance premiums grew 31 per cent year on year to S$27.6 billion, accounting for approximately 21 per cent of Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinsurance market. Although figures for 2024 are not yet available, the momentum is expected to have continued.Chris Lim, associate director at credit rating agency AM Best, highlighted that the country benefits from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategically advantageous geographical location within Asia-Pacific\u00e2\u20ac which allows Singapore-domiciled reinsurers to transact overseas easily.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Singapore is a well-established insurance and reinsurance hub, made up of a vibrant ecosystem of reinsurance players, reinsurance brokers and other financial service providers,\u00e2\u20ac he added.Regional hubCurrently, the Republic serves as the Asia-Pacific headquarters for 12 of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top global insurers and reinsurers. </p><p>Among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 have established their regional hubs in Singapore, covering markets in Asean, North and South Asia, as well as Australia.More specialty insurers and international insurance firms are choosing the city-state as their regional hub, noted Justin Ward, managing director of Asia-Pacific capital advisory at reinsurance specialist Guy Carpenter. He likened Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic position to that of London in Europe and New York in North America.For example, Ward said, Singapore serves as the hub for Guy Carpenter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s South-east Asia and South Korea operations.The company follows a hub-and-spoke model, with smaller offices in Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea, but Singapore remains central for key functions such as actuarial services, capital management, market strategy and client management. He added that this strategic focus has allowed the firm to effectively deploy capabilities and attract offshore business to the Republic.Ward foresees that reinsurers will increasingly focus on strengthening their capabilities in the Singapore market this year.He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see a concerted effort (by) the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore government to ensure that Singapore may remain at the forefront of insurance and reinsurance innovation in the region. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that abating. We see that increasing speed post-Covid and (with) further innovation coming through.\u00e2\u20acDeputy Prime Minister and MAS chairman Gan Kim Yong noted that the Singapore government has committed to doubling down on developing a marketplace of insurers and reinsurers, in a speech at last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Singapore International Reinsurance Conference (SIRC).He added that the government will also work with insurers and reinsurers in the city-state to deepen their capabilities, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI).\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Through strengthening our insurance ecosystem, deepening capabilities, including in AI, and developing alternative risk transfer markets in Asia, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading reinsurance hub,\u00e2\u20ac he said.Victor Kuk, head of property and casualty reinsurance for South-east Asia, India, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan at Swiss Re, pointed out that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stable political and financial environment is another incentive for many companies to conduct business activities here.With Singapore being a gateway for many businesses to international as well as South-east Asian markets, the firm can leverage this unique geographic location to support its clients throughout the region more effectively, he added.Looking at recent regulatory developments in Singapore, Kuk anticipates that these will help \u00e2\u20ac\u0153position the reinsurance industry for long-term resilience\u00e2\u20ac and bring about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an opportunity for the market to align with global standards\u00e2\u20ac.Last August, the MAS imposed stricter oversight for insurers with reinsurance contracts, requiring them to submit terms and conditions for review, with the possibility of audits.This move followed a report from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, which raised concerns about the growing allocation of capital to alternative assets and the increasing use of cross-border, asset-intensive reinsurance.Alternative risk transferSingapore has been focusing on expanding its insurance capacity through alternative risk transfer instruments, such as sovereign insurance solutions and insurance-linked securities (ILS).\u00c2\u00a0ILS are financial instruments tied to risks such as natural disasters, specialty insurance risks, and life and health insurance. They provide an alternative way for insurers and reinsurers to transfer large risks to capital-market investors.Gan previously noted that the government is supporting the development of ILS markets in Asia to increase the available financial capacity for covering major catastrophe risks, especially since Asia currently represents less than 5 per cent of the global catastrophe bond market.To further these efforts, MAS is collaborating with the ILS industry to promote these instruments as an asset class for private wealth and investment portfolios, in a drive to channel growing investments from both private wealth and institutional investors in Asia into ILS.Among the most well-known forms of ILS are catastrophe bonds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or cat bonds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which transfer specific risks, usually from natural disasters, from sponsors to capital-market investors.\u00c2\u00a0Cat bonds are becoming increasingly important as they help address protection gaps that are widening, due to the growing impact of climate change, when traditional insurance coverage is often insufficient.Currently, there are 14 ILS listed on the Singapore Exchange, including cat bonds issued by global specialty insurer and reinsurer MS Amlin Asia Pacific.Guy Carpenter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ward, however, stressed the need for greater interest in ILS from asset managers in Singapore and the wider region, which would contribute to a more vibrant alternative risk transfer market.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What will be interesting, moving forward, is how we continue to gain momentum around alternative sources of capital that can be made available to reinsurers and insurers, whether through the presence of fund managers (or) the insurance sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on ILS, and how that will change the sources of capital available for insurers and reinsurers.\u00e2\u20acClimate transitionClimate transition in Asia is expected to drive growing demand for reinsurance, creating significant opportunities that Singapore can leverage.While the region is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, it also faces a significant protection gap, particularly in terms of catastrophe coverage. In 2023, economic losses in the Asia-Pacific region totalled US$65 billion, with 91 per cent of these losses uninsured, compared with a 30 per cent protection gap in the US.Kuk of Swiss Re highlighted that climate change will lead to an increased risk of natural catastrophes across Asia-Pacific, particularly in coastal areas and urban centres located in flood-prone river zones.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Protective measures need to be taken for insurance products to remain economical for such properties at high risk,\u00e2\u20ac he said.He added that the reinsurance industry plays an important role in building resilience before an event strikes through mitigation efforts as well as after, especially in emerging markets at risk of natural catastrophes and where insurance penetration may not be as high.Gan noted in his SIRC speech that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on sustainable finance and green insurance products has further positioned the country as a preferred hub for reinsurers, particularly as the sector confronts climate-related risks.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the country actively building its research on physical impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, climate-impact modelling and nature-based solutions, reinsurers can leverage these insights to improve their risk assessment models, portfolio management strategies and climate disclosures,\u00e2\u20ac he said.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["He added that the reinsurance industry plays an important role in building resilience before an event strikes through mitigation efforts as well as after, especially in emerging markets at risk of natural catastrophes and where insurance penetration may not be as high.

For the first time in Singapore, the new initiative will trial the use of mineral accretion technology to stimulate the growth of hard corals by subjecting them to low-voltage electricity. The trial is supported by an initial seed funding of around $200,000 by Aramco Asia Singapore through the Garden City Fund. In addition, Aramco Asia Singapore will support a new educational programme on local marine biology and marine conservation efforts for schools and the general public from 2021 to 2022.

The Festival of Biodiversity, organised by NParks in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable, is an annual event that showcases and celebrates the community's efforts to conserve Singapore's natural heritage. The Festival aims to deepen appreciation and build stronger ownership of our rich biodiversity among Singaporeans. The United Nations designates 22 May as the International Day for Biological Diversity to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues. This year's theme, \"We're part of the solution\" is aligned with NParks' efforts to partner the community in protecting Singapore's biodiversity and enhancing ecological and climate resilience.</p><p>Since the first edition of Festival of Biodiversity 10 years ago, the number of partners who have helped organised the Festival has grown from under 30 to 67 today, including nature groups, schools, work groups comprising academics, individuals and other stakeholders, as well as members from the Friends of the Parks initiative. The number of citizen scientists has also grown from 470 in 2015 to over 9,000 in 2021, and they are part of NParks' growing volunteer base. As of 2021, NParks has more than 54,000 volunteers. NParks will continue to partner the community and enable more Singaporeans to become active stewards of our biodiversity and environment.</p><p>Source: National Parks Board of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Sept.

Nature-based solutions are, simply put, about using nature to improve the state of the world. </p><p>These solutions could provide over one-third of the cost-effective climate mitigation needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, said GenZero, an investment platform dedicated to decarbonisation solutions. According to a report by state investment firm Temasek in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and strategic economics consultancy AlphaBeta, nature-based opportunities across 3 systems - food, land, and ocean; infrastructure and the built environment; as well as energy and extractives - could deliver US$4.3 trillion of annual economic value and generate 232 million jobs by 2030 in Asia-Pacific. Opportunities for nature-based solutionsThe phrase \"nature-based solutions\" may be relatively new, but the concept behind it is not. Humans have been planting trees for centuries to control erosion, for example. Suvro Sarkar, analyst at DBS Group Research, said that forest and wetlands conservation as well as active afforestation and reforestation still remain key focus areas. Others include blue carbon projects, which involve harnessing the power of carbon sequestration through algae, mangroves, seagrasses and other plants in coastal areas. Soil carbon and agriculture projects could also help in reducing emissions from soil degradation and food production practices. But new opportunities have risen in today's modern economy. The development of carbon markets can play a major role in financing these nature-based solutions. Koh said that governments and businesses are sourcing for nature-based carbon credits mainly from international voluntary carbon markets or from carbon project developers directly. \"Most of these credits derive from forest conservation projects and reforestation projects, which generate carbon emission avoidance credits and carbon dioxide removal credits, respectively,\" he said. According to global asset manager BlackRock, there is tremendous growth potential for voluntary carbon markets, as corporates, industries and governments race to meet their net-zero commitments. The total addressable market for voluntary carbon markets is expected to grow by between 15 and 60 times by 2030. Based on forecasts from Trove Research, a data and advisory company specialising in climate strategy and carbon markets, the value of carbon offsets will grow from US$2.8 billion in 2021 to US$63 billion in 2030.It also projected that the carbon credit price has to at least double from US$10 per tonne in 2020 to between US$20 and US$30 per tonne in 2030 in order to incentivise sufficient investment in carbon offset projects for the demand.Singapore has jumped on this growing market through the launch of Climate Impact X, a carbon exchange jointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered Bank, and Temasek.Ho Pei Hwa, analyst at DBS Group Research, said that companies developing tools and platforms to make the trading of carbon credits easier and more transparent in the future will be keenly watched. Circular economy initiativesSimilar to nature-based solutions, reusing and recycling are not new ideas. But the focus now on environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations has created market opportunities in areas such as product redesign and waste management. Meghan Sharp, head of Decarbonization Partners - a joint venture between BlackRock and Temasek that invests in decarbonisation solutions - said they are looking at an opportunity in the synthetic leather space, where the material is made out of mushrooms. Mycellium, which is a part of a fungus from which mushrooms grow, is said to be able to reduce carbon footprint by 5 times as it is bio-degradable. Ellen Martin, director of impact and insights at The Circulate Initiative - the non-profit arm of investment management firm Circulate Capital - noted that global players such as PepsiCo and Unilever have committed to having all of their plastic packaging be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. \"This in turn creates demand for recycled products and materials and encourages innovations in the waste management space that may not have otherwise been realised,\" she said.DBS Group Research said Internet of Things solutions could be used to manage waste collection, whereby devices could be used to sort out waste for efficient recycling. Artificial intelligence could also be utilised to better predict demand for goods and services, so that companies can better manage their inventory to minimise use of resources or wastage. It also added that the sharing economy could be digitalised through the development of mobile applications that promote the donation of used items, as well as the repairing and recycling of electronic items. An emerging technology-based approach to the circular economy model is the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) capabilities. CCUS is a collective term that refers to a range of solutions that essentially allow carbon dioxide, produced through the burning of fossil fuels, to either be stored underground or converted into other useful substances, thereby preventing it from reaching the Earth's atmosphere. According to Ho, CCUS is one of the most cost-effective solutions available for the large-scale reduction of emissions. Currently, about 40 million tonnes of carbon is captured each year. However, CCUS deployment must increase by about 140 times for the amount of carbon captured to reach 5.6 Gigatonnes, said the Global CCS Institute. This amount would account for a fifth of emissions reductions needed by 2050.Due to Singapore's limited land space, Sarkar pointed out that the use of waste-to-energy plants and CCUS could be key tools in carbon recycling. The issues inhibiting the scaling of CCUS are down to costs and uncertainties around its performance. While the technology has been around for decades, it is still considered immature, and the cost to capture and store post-combustion emissions remain very high, said Ho. \"This needs to be resolved through incentivising and ramping up research and development in this field and implementing carbon taxes worldwide. Higher prices of carbon compliance could act as a tipping point towards reaching economies of scale for CCUS technologies,\" said Ho. Making that transitionAccording to a 2021 survey conducted by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 51 per cent of a sample of 51 cities and regions from 21 OECD countries do not yet have a circular economy initiative, though they are planning to. Only 12 per cent indicated that they did not have plans to develop one, while the remaining 37 per cent already have programmes in place. Some of the biggest obstacles cited by respondents to transiting to a circular economy include the lack of financing, financial risks, and an inadequate regulatory framework. \"Focusing on a more sustainable way of living has never been more urgent, with global temperatures on the rise, more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and more,\" said DBS Group Research. \"In our view, a circular economy can alleviate the challenges that come about with global warming, though significant progress is still needed.\" However, moving from a linear economy to a circular one requires a transformation of global supply chains, and this cannot be accomplished in isolation, said Martin. While companies are working with suppliers to pilot new materials and production methods, governments can support the growth of circular solutions and influence the way businesses operate through enabling policies such as regulations defining recycled-content requirements, she said. \"Policymakers also have the opportunity to facilitate more private investments into the circular economy by introducing financing mechanisms that reduce or share risk,\" added Martin. She also suggested companies can start their transition with small steps before advancing to more significant business model shifts. \"From a product development perspective, companies can look at replacing hard-to-recycle materials such as multi-layer plastic film with more sustainable alternatives. This in turn ensures that end-products can be reintroduced into the economy and are kept out of landfills,\" she added. On top of the long-term challenge of mitigating climate change, governments are also tackling other more-present problems, such as supply chain disruptions, energy security concerns and inflation woes. Koh said many will have to reconcile and, in some cases, triage these competing priorities. \"However, there are opportunities to leverage science and technology to help inform government and business decisions on which solutions to prioritise, where to target our actions and how to execute them for maximum benefit while minimising trade-offs,\" he said.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Rain gardens that help cleanse stormwater run-off, support more native biodiversity and enhance flood protection have been incorporated.

Countries in the region also need assistance to phase out coal.</p><p> But the recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference COP29 could offer some hope, with developed countries agreeing to channel US$300 billion (S$402 billion) a year to developing countries by 2035. The ultimate aim is to raise US$1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for countries in need, through various forms of finance. </p><p> But the US$300 billion core amount was criticised as woefully insufficient by climate-vulnerable countries and civil society, who expected richer countries -- who were historical emitters -- to commit more. </p><p> It is also uncertain how the amount will be raised. While developed countries will take the lead, the COP29 decision stated that the amount will come from \"a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources\".</p><p> Mr Gao Xi, a research associate at the NUS Energy Studies Institute (ESI), said: \"Most South-east Asian countries are coastal, making them particularly vulnerable to threats such as typhoons, floods and droughts caused by climate change. Frequent extreme weather events often result in significant financial losses and social disruptions.\"</p><p> In 2024 alone, the Philippines was struck by six typhoons within a span of 30 days -- between October and November -- killing more than 170 people, displacing more than 214,000 people and causing damage worth about 470 million pesos (S$10.8 million). While the archipelago is prone to tropical storms, such back-to-back typhoons within a month is unusual. </p><p> As most countries in South-east Asia are still developing and have relatively weak economic foundations, climate finance is necessary for the region to take climate action, added Mr Gao, with money particularly needed for clean energy generation, low-carbon transport and coastal defence.</p><p> According to the International Energy Agency, Asean will need US$21 billion in investments annually from 2026 to 2030 just to upgrade its energy infrastructure. And to build resilience against climate impacts, the region needs US$422 billion until 2030.</p><p> The finance outcomes from the UN conference in Azerbaijan could also benefit other developments in South-east Asia, such as the future regional power grid and carbon trading, which can also benefit Singapore. </p><p> Funding the  Asean power grid The funds pledged at COP29 could provide crucial support for accelerating the development of the Asean power grid. </p><p> One of the region's decades-long ambitions, the complex power interconnection will enable electricity trade across borders -- for both energy security and access to greener energy. </p><p> The regional ambition made progress with the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore electricity import pilot in 2022, which transmitted 100MW of hydropower from Laos to Singapore, via Malaysia and Thailand. This was later extended to include another 100MW from Malaysia's electricity grid in October 2024, but this includes a mix of energy sources, including coal and natural gas. </p><p>Singapore is also laying the groundwork for the regional grid by committing to import 5.6GW of clean electricity from Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia. </p><p> Asean envisions a power grid by 2045, and climate finance has the potential to address the unique challenges of financing such a large-scale, multi-country initiative, said Mr Beni Suryadi, acting executive director at the Asean Centre for Energy based in Indonesia. </p><p> Several key challenges make traditional financing for the Asean power grid difficult. One is cross-border investment risks, since the giant grid will involve multiple countries with different regulatory frameworks and tariffs.</p><p> Another is the high upfront capital required, especially for building the grid and transmission infrastructure. The resulting long payback periods can put off traditional investors, who seek quicker returns, noted Mr Beni.</p><p> Climate finance can loosen these gridlocks. These funds often come in the form of concessional loans with low interest rates, grants, or guarantees which lower the financial risks for private investors. When forms of finance like green bonds, blended finance and funding from the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank are injected into a mega-project first, the risks are lowered for private investors to participate. </p><p> Blended finance refers to bringing together monies from the public sector, the multilateral development banks, philanthropies and the private sector. </p><p> \"This is where climate finance can step in -- by bridging these gaps, mitigating risks, and enabling investments that otherwise might not materialise,\" he added. </p><p> As a wealthier developing country, Singapore would not be a recipient of the US$1.3 trillion, and instead would contribute voluntarily to climate finance. But the island-state would be a beneficiary, nonetheless, of the Asean power grid, which would enable it to import low-carbon and renewable electricity to reduce its carbon emissions. </p><p>Singapore's National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) said the Asean power grid would maximise the region's diverse renewable energy potential by matching renewable resource-rich areas with those that need to buy clean energy. </p><p> \"By doing so, it can reduce the region's dependence on fossil fuels, increase resilience against fluctuations in global energy markets and make progress towards our decarbonisation targets,\" the NCCS spokesperson added. </p><p> But while the Asean power grid is undoubtedly a worthy project, directing climate finance to it would not be straightforward, as it would be considered an electricity transmission project, said Mr Beni. </p><p> Whether transmission projects are considered to be green and contribute to reducing carbon emissions is still a question to be settled.</p><p> \"At the moment, climate finance for transmission infrastructure projects is still nascent, while the needs are huge,\" he added. </p><p> South-east Asia: Between the devil and the deep blue seaSouth-east Asia is in a tricky position when it comes to receiving climate finance as stipulated by COP29. On the one hand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia were, until 2019, among the 20 countries most exposed to climate risks, according to the Global Climate Risk Index, which is published by non-profit organisation Germanwatch. </p><p> But South-east Asia is expected to continue its fast economic growth, accompanied by more greenhouse gas emissions, noted Dr Kim Jeong Won, a senior research fellow at ESI. </p><p> This growth has reclassified many Asean nations as middle-income countries, reducing their eligibility for development financing, she added. </p><p> Among the developing nations, the least developed countries and small island developing states are recognised as having the greatest need for support. </p><p> Given the competition for funding, a significant gap already exists between the required investments and actual finance that the countries have received. For example, only 9.7 per cent of investments from the UN's Green Climate Fund -- the world's largest fund of its kind -- has been channelled to South-east Asia. </p><p> Similarly, only 6.3 per cent of investments from the UN's Adaptation Fund has been allocated to Asean countries, said Dr Kim. </p><p> She added: \"South-east Asian countries are expected to compete for limited bilateral and multilateral public funding with other low-income developing countries.\"</p><p> If they want to attract a greater share of private funding, it is vital that countries develop more innovative finance models and attractive climate-related projects, she noted. </p><p> Ms Lau Xin Yi, sustainable finance lead for South-east Asia at the Carbon Trust consultancy, is looking at a newer type of finance tool called climate transition bonds.</p><p> The proceeds from these bonds can be used for a wider range of decarbonisation projects, including those in hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement and petrochemicals.</p><p> Despite guidelines to prevent greenwashing, Ms Lau noted that about 90 per cent of the transition bonds issued globally has been dominated by Japan's issuances.</p><p> \"Climate transition bonds can help South-east Asia unlock more capital needed for its low-carbon transition. More capital will be channelled towards clean technologies, but how transition is achieved will vary across sectors and regions,\" said Ms Lau. </p><p> More incentives to  protect Asean forestsA bright spot at COP29 was an agreement on carbon trading, achieved after nearly 10 years of negotiations. </p><p> Carbon trading is governed under a segment of the Paris Agreement known as Article 6, which was finalised at COP29. This means countries can trade carbon credits in two ways -- either under a UN-managed carbon programme or through bilateral agreements.  </p><p>Singapore is currently collaborating with more than 20 countries in carbon markets, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia. </p><p> With Article 6 in place, NCCS said countries that do not have their own national registry to transfer credits can also now use an international registry or receive support from the UN to create their own system. </p><p> \"This reduces the barriers to entry, encouraging more countries to start engaging in carbon markets cooperation, including with Singapore.\"</p><p> Mr Anshari Rahman, director of policy and analytics at Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero, said that carbon markets can unlock financing for deserving and untapped technology, and nature-based solutions in the region.</p><p> South-east Asia, which is home to the world's third-largest tropical forest basin after the Amazon and the Congo, would have more incentives to protect it, if it were to receive carbon credits arising from nature-based projects. </p><p> Mr Olivier Levallois, founder of Hamerkop Climate Impacts, said some examples are a peat swamp conservation project in Indonesia's Tanjung Puting National Park, and a carbon forestry programme in Timor-Leste that also benefits small-scale farmers.</p><p>Singapore has also mandated that carbon project developers must contribute 5 per cent of their share of proceeds from carbon credits towards the host country's adaptation efforts. This is another way of raising climate finance. </p><p> \"Considering Singapore's position as a regional carbon trading hub, it should benefit from this early-stage excitement, with more project developers getting involved and capital flowing into carbon projects,\" added Mr Levallois.</p><p> Mr Anshari noted that progress on Article 6 at COP29 helped to shore up market confidence for carbon markets, which have been under scrutiny for years. </p><p> Mr Levallois said the next steps are to work towards carbon projects, set up regulatory frameworks and develop carbon monitoring methods. A crucial aspect of this process is to increase demand for credits. </p><p> \"The market needs to have stronger demand signal, and it is unclear yet whether companies will suddenly trust these (Article 6) mechanisms and make funding available to address their climate impacts,\" he added.</p><p> Mr Anshari said: \"We are closely tracking the development of the infrastructure and tracking systems required to operationalise Article 6 decisions, and we expect to see meaningful progress in 2025 with the first few (carbon) projects to be registered under the (UN) by COP30 in Brazil.\" </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["With Article 6 in place, NCCS said countries that do not have their own national registry to transfer credits can also now use an international registry or receive support from the UN to create their own system. \"This reduces the barriers to entry, encouraging more countries to start engaging in carbon markets cooperation, including with Singapore.

Ways must be found to win popular support to accelerate the shift to a low-carbon future. It requires a fair transition, one that overcomes the anxieties over costs that have led to pushback within many populations. But it also means overcoming the short-sightedness that is now the norm in most societies, so as to ensure fairness not only today but also for future generations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Likewise, the challenge of meeting the needs of steadily ageing societies, without sending the invoice to the next generation. And so too, dealing with AI (artificial intelligence) -- the most profound technological change of our times, with benefits as well as risks that are likely to grow exponentially in the coming decade and beyond. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We can address these long challenges only by stretching our economic and political horizons. And by finding ways to rebuild optimism and solidarity within our societies, so that people can imagine how the future can be better for all. The collective belief in the future has to be both the means and the end.</p><p> Building a realistic optimism We are starting from a difficult place. Confidence in the future has been on the decline in most societies. They are also more divided. A survey of 19 high- and middle-income societies by Pew Research in 2022 found the majority feeling more divided than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Only three countries avoided this, including Singapore, where 75 per cent of people felt more united than before the pandemic. On top of all this, confidence in the multilateral order is at its lowest point.  </p><p> Yet, to tackle problems like climate change, we must first recognise the scale and seriousness of the challenge -- not so we add to the mood of despondency, but so we build realistic optimism. </p><p> The world is far behind the actions it needs to stay within 1.5 deg C of global warming, and to prevent accelerated warming after we hit 1.5 deg C. The best scientific estimates tell us that the remaining carbon budget, or the maximum amount of emissions the world can make so that global warming remains below 1.5 deg C, is likely to be used up in about five years' time. </p><p> Even more worrying: there is radical uncertainty as to what comes next. The planet is losing its critical buffers against warming -- the natural ecosystems on land and in the oceans, that have been soaking up more than 50 per cent of carbon dioxide that the world emits, are losing that ability. It is also beginning to cross tipping points -- such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and the shift in the Amazon from being a huge carbon sink to being a net emitter -- which can lead to runaway global warming. </p><p> The implications are clear. First, tackling climate change will be much more costly, and vastly more complex and difficult, if we defer action. We must act early, especially to develop scale in clean energy and green technologies, so that they become as affordable and as reliable as what we do with fossil fuels. </p><p> Second, clear and credible public policies are key to achieving the scale and speed that is required. Carbon pricing has to be the centrepiece. It will help catalyse the needed shift in private investments towards green opportunities in every sector, and also provide the revenues needed to support the transition and ensure poorer segments of the population are not disadvantaged. But it is generally understood that carbon pricing, within socially realistic limits, will not on its own be adequate. Targeted regulations in specific sectors, which in many cases such as in aviation and maritime transport will have to be internationally managed, are needed to provide certainty for businesses and spur innovation. </p><p> We also need public investment in R&amp;D and to build out new grids and other public infrastructure for a clean energy future. But higher spending will be a problem in many countries -- given already large public debts, and interest rates which are no longer low. They have to find a pragmatic path, to protect future generations from exploding debt burdens, but also protect them from the huge costs that climate change will cause. </p><p> Europe epitomises this challenge. Eminent former leaders like Italy's Mario Draghi and Germany's Angela Merkel -- who had herself pushed for Germany's conservative \"debt brake\" laws when she was the country's chancellor -- have now proposed that the public sector be allowed to borrow for a transitional period for investments in the green transition and other critical needs.  </p><p> Third, and the most challenging governance task: we need international coordination to solve the climate crisis. Otherwise, we risk carbon leakage -- where higher-emitting companies and activities shift to countries with more accommodating policies. But besides their differing levels of political will, the complexity comes from the fact that countries have been using different sets of measures to encourage decarbonisation. Europe has been relying on the full mix of carbon pricing, regulation and subsidies, whereas China has introduced only limited pricing and the US has eschewed it altogether. Finding some equivalence between the measures taken by these major emitters so as to determine their \"effective\" carbon pricing rates will be a difficult matter. But it cannot be avoided.  </p><p> Reframing the debateWe need a new understanding in trade, investments and technology transfers, to enable the world to benefit from China's low-cost clean energy technologies, such as its solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. And likewise, to take advantage of innovations in the United States, such as in hydrogen power, carbon capture and other next-generation clean technologies. The key goal must be to maximise scale, affordability and the speed of the global transition, recognising that the world is far behind in the race against climate change. It will be aided by not limiting market access to products and technologies based on where they come from, but instead pursuing the solutions that still exist for win-win economic outcomes. </p><p> We must also overcome the perennial tensions over climate financing for the developing world, which are not getting us anywhere. The debate has to be reframed; from viewing it not as a matter of how much aid should be given from rich nations to poor, but as investment in the global commons that all nations will benefit from. Dollar for dollar, investments in climate transition in the developing world in fact have a more significant impact on global emissions than in the advanced economies. </p><p> Blended finance, where we bring together monies from the public sector, the multilateral development banks and the private sector, and where possible philanthropies, is an important way to scale up these investments. That's why Singapore launched the Fast-P (Financing Asia's Transition Partnership) programme this year, to help spur the transition to low carbon in Asia. </p><p> The good news recently has been in carbon markets. Consensus on how to operationalise Article 6 of the Paris Agreement -- governing how countries can trade carbon credits -- was finally achieved at COP29 in Baku, with Singapore playing the role of co-facilitator. It will also add impetus to efforts to develop a voluntary carbon market with credible standards and verification mechanisms. The challenge is in the doing. An example is the Transition Credits Coalition that MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) is working on, to make possible an early phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Asia.</p><p> Finally, we need a new narrative on climate change that has appeal to populations. Pushback has come from those who feel they have to bear the costs of decarbonisation today, in exchange for benefits to society in the distant future. Part of the solution must be to ensure that adjustments are fair to ordinary households. But decarbonising the economy can itself be a growth opportunity in the coming decade itself -- with heightened investments creating many jobs and new businesses. It is an opportunity for clean air today -- remember that millions of people each year die from air pollution caused by fossil fuel-based energy, with many more suffering from ill health. And nature-based solutions will help give populations clean water supply, and provide a buffer against flood and other weather extremities. So while the largest benefits come decades later, the dividends for populations from climate action begin flowing early. </p><p> AI: focus on early wins, and avoiding the worst possible harmsThe second looming issue is AI. It presents massive opportunities for improved well-being -- from better healthcare to productivity in every sector. But there are also major risks. There are bleak scenarios of how AI will remove a large segment of jobs, including those of the middle class. No one can say for sure that it won't happen. There is also the prospect of AI systems moving beyond our control, as most AI programs get to be written by AI itself. And as Dr Henry Kissinger warned in his final book, AI poses a global security dilemma of an existential nature. More immediately, there's the risk that AI poses for democracy itself, by accentuating misinformation and social polarisation. We already see this today, but it will only grow in the next decade and beyond.</p><p> Yet, we must have a sense of realism when we think of how we should regulate AI. There will remain a fundamental mismatch between the pace at which AI is developing and regulators' ability to set rules around it. We cannot delay AI until we are perfectly sure it is safe; in fact, we should assume that there will be some bad. Our approach should be to maximise the benefits of AI and minimise the risk of the worst possible harms to safety and society, and not think we can regulate AI comprehensively to avoid all that could be bad.</p><p> Look for early wins. In healthcare, for instance, through much earlier and better diagnosis and treatment. In learning, with the potential that AI offers for personalised tutoring, through life. In improving farming yields. And in virtually every sector, to improve the productivity of those in the workforce by having an AI tool to augment your own capabilities.</p><p> Further, not every problem created by AI will be best solved by trying to regulate AI. The real solutions to avoid job and income losses, which could come in both advanced and developing countries, lie in other economic and social strategies. We've got to double down on preparing young people and the workforce of today for an AI era. Countries may have to introduce new wage subsidies, or use progressive tax and transfer systems to mitigate inequalities. Every society has to be ready with these strategies, to ensure we can benefit from AI whilst buffering its downsides.</p><p> Critically, too, we will need international cooperation to govern AI. It must involve the US and China talking directly with each other. But we must carry on with the important work of building a broad coalition of interests that can make the most of expertise from every source.  </p><p> Don't send the invoice to the next generation The third long challenge: preserving optimism as societies age. Almost every higher-income country is ageing, and a few emerging countries too. We will see this go further in the next 30 years, changing the nature of society.</p><p> However, many systems of financing healthcare and pensions are unsustainable, and are now likely to pose a major burden on the next generation. Unfortunately, most are also dealing with this challenge late in the day, when a large segment of the population is already retired or close to doing so. Reforms are still possible, but now come at greater political cost, which many democracies are finding insurmountable.</p><p> Healthcare spending will have to go up, if we are to provide quality and affordable care for growing older populations. The costs have to be paid for fairly, across a population. We should start by recognising that there is no such thing as free healthcare for people anywhere -- even in the systems like the UK's where you pay little or nothing when you turn up in hospital, people pay for it through taxes or mandatory national insurance contributions.</p><p> But a key lesson from most countries is that to keep the system fair, and keep healthcare costs from going up excessively, we have to avoid a heavy reliance on just one source of payments. We need a balance between government subsidies, co-payments by individuals when they are treated, and insurance policies -- as we have in Singapore, for example. It is also how we ensure that those who can afford it get less subsidies and pay their fair share.</p><p> More importantly, staying healthy and keeping healthcare costs down doesn't just depend on healthcare systems. In fact, much of it depends on our habits and the social environment around us as we age. Are we staying active? Do we have regular friends? Do we have hobbies? Are we still learning something and staying curious? Are we countering the ageing brain? That's all critical in staying healthy, and to living long and satisfying lives. And in Singapore, we are very serious about making this possible.</p><p> Rebuilding solidarityFinally, as I mentioned at the start, we have to rebuild the collective belief that the future can be better for all. We have to find ways to get beyond the zero-sum thinking that is now prevalent within many societies -- where each group feels that its future is pitched against another. Find ways to address the concerns of segments in each population who feel that the elite do not understand their day-to-day problems. And find ways to rebuild a sense of common humanity, by sustaining the international rule of law and norms of conduct, and by pitching in to strengthen the global commons.</p><p> Yet, solidarity, a sense that our lives are connected and indeed enriched by what we do for each other, is a neglected dimension of democracy. We understand very well the importance of justice, and the freedoms that different democracies are organised around, but it requires something more for democracies to work well in today's world. Where we're not just individuals wanting to be equal and free, but we have bonds of reciprocity with one another, and we know it's those bonds that will help us tackle the challenges we now face and take us forward.  </p><p> Solidarity has to be rebuilt into how we practise democracy, how societies are governed, and how we respect one another in our lives.</p><p> This is an abridged version of a speech by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, in delivering the inaugural JY Pillay Lecture on Governance on Nov 27.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["But decarbonising the economy can itself be a growth opportunity in the coming decade itself -- with heightened investments creating many jobs and new businesses.

The facts speak for themselves. </p><p> More than half of the world's gross domestic product, equivalent to an estimated US$58 trillion, is moderately or highly dependent on nature, according to a 2023 report by professional service firm PwC. </p><p> Yet, the Global Biodiversity Framework -- a United Nations pact agreed on by almost 200 nations -- estimates the biodiversity finance gap to be US$700 billion a year between now and 2030. This refers to the difference between the funding available for conservation and the amount that it requires. </p><p> Closing the gap requires the repurposing of US$500 billion per year in harmful subsidies, such as those that incentivise the overharvesting of the ocean, for instance, and mobilising the remaining US$200 billion from all sources -- including the private sector. </p><p> Relying on philanthropic funding and governments to fund nature's protection, as has been the case for decades, will simply no longer be enough, given the scale of the problem. </p><p> The World Wide Fund for Nature estimated in 2022 that there has been an average decline of 69 per cent in species populations since 1970. </p><p> As highlighted by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, the financial sector can put \"capitalism's profit motive to work to protect and restore nature\", and serve as a powerful engine for closing the funding gap. </p><p> Nature in perilThe realisation that there is money to be made in conservation comes amid a global reckoning of nature's true value, as the interrelationship between biodiversity loss and the climate crisis becomes clearer. </p><p> Given the flurry of net-zero targets made by governments and corporations around the world, the business case for climate-friendly investments like renewable energy plants or energy efficient technology is apparent. Moreover, some of the losses wrought by climate impacts -- infrastructure damage, loss of lives and livelihoods -- are quantifiable.</p><p> But the protection of nature has traditionally been treated as an issue separate from the climate crisis. The signs of nature in peril are also far more insidious compared to climate impacts -- what is the effect on bottom lines if a species is hunted into oblivion? </p><p> Yet, the two planetary crises are closely interlinked. Studies have shown that the clearance and burning of tropical forests account for about 20 per cent of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p> And the cumulative loss of species can compromise nature's ability to provide. Just as it takes many nails to ensure the stability of a bookshelf, an ecosystem also requires many species to thrive. The loss of a nail or two might not compromise a shelf's ability to hold books -- but how many \"nails\" can a habitat lose before it collapses? </p><p> There is a silver lining in that there has been a growing awareness of the links between nature's decline and climate change. </p><p> The annual UN climate change conferences, which usually focus on decarbonisation, are increasingly touching on the role of nature. </p><p> At COP26 in 2021, some 140 nations signed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use outlining a global vision for forest protection.</p><p> That COP also saw countries reaching an agreement on a framework that will allow carbon credits to be used to meet national climate targets -- a pivotal milestone in the creation of a global financing mechanism for forest conservation. By protecting a forest from being cut down, land developers can sell carbon credits from the emissions savings to an emitter elsewhere, who can use the credits to offset its emissions.</p><p> The following year, nature-based solutions were referenced for the first time in the COP27 decision text. At COP28 in 2023, there were also discussions on other financing schemes to protect nature, such as debt-for-nature swaps in which sovereign debt of a developing country is cut in exchange for nature conservation measures.</p><p> The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures has also provided a set of recommendations to enable companies to assess, report and act on their nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. </p><p> It is now clear that nature is a key element of discussions on the climate -- and policymakers and business leaders must respond. </p><p> The business of conservationThere are already signs of how the financial sector's involvement is opening new revenue streams for nature. </p><p> Revenue from carbon credits can fund the protection and restoration of forests and mangroves. In a sign of how there is money to be made in this space, Temasek in 2022 launched GenZero, an investment platform company that counts among its investment focus areas nature-based solutions that protect and restore natural ecosystems. </p><p> On May 28, GenZero announced that it is co-funding the initial phase of an ecosystem restoration project in South Africa, which involves the replanting of spekboom -- a succulent native to the region -- across 10,000ha of degraded land. When the project is scaled up to 100,000ha of land, the carbon project developer, Imperative, estimates that it will help to remove over 30 million tonnes of planet-warming emissions over its lifetime. </p><p> Other innovative financial products include insurance schemes that pay out for the restoration of coral reefs -- habitats that can reduce shoreline erosion -- when a tropical cyclone damages them. </p><p> In November 2022, the first ever pay-out by the Mesoamerican Reef Insurance Programme was triggered when the Turneffe Atoll off the coast of Belize was hit by Hurricane Lisa. The Asian Development Bank has also approved US$3.8 million to develop climate risk financing and insurance solutions to protect coral reef ecosystems in Fiji, Indonesia, the Philippines and Solomon Islands.</p><p> Individual species like the critically endangered black rhinoceros are also benefiting from novel financing products such as the rhino bond -- the world's first wildlife conservation debt instrument issued by the World Bank. </p><p> In April 2024, conservation groups and representatives from 10 tiger range countries such as Bhutan, Cambodia and Malaysia, gathered in Bhutan for the Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference, which discussed ways to raise US$1 billion from global public and private investors and institutions for tiger conservation by 2034. </p><p> Despite optimism over the increased attention being paid to nature and the interest in increasing financing flows to its conservation, concerns have rightly been raised by non-government organisations about whether outcomes will be compromised when profit-making becomes a focus. </p><p> Carbon credit project developers have been flagged for infringing on the rights of communities living on the land, and there have also been allegations that carbon credits sold from certain projects do not represent genuine carbon emissions reductions.  </p><p> But it is worth noting that the financial sector's interest in nature is not blooming in a vacuum -- governments, multilateral organisations and businesses are also recognising that healthy ecosystems are integral for a prosperous future. </p><p> Enhanced scrutiny of such projects and regulatory frameworks that increasingly factor in the need to prevent nature loss -- such as England's \"biodiversity net gain\" law that requires developers to achieve a net gain in biodiversity through restoring lost habitats on-site or elsewhere -- are also helping to shape the trajectory of conservation efforts. </p><p> Just as ecosystem engineers help biodiversity in nature by unlocking nutrients from the environment, so too can financial institutions enhance the impact of conservation activities, creating a future where both people and planet can thrive.  </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["In April, Singapore investment company Temasek convened the Ecosperity Week sustainability conference where \"nature positivity\" -- a buzzword that encapsulates the goal to halt and reverse nature loss -- was discussed by the bankers and investors in the room.

In 2023, Singapore and Papua New Guinea signed a similar agreement. Singapore has a key role in driving the green transition, which hinges on ramping up funding for innovations that cut emissions across a swathe of industries and saving nature.

The good news is that there is enough money and technical know-how for the world to go truly green. As Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam noted in a recent speech, the global capital market is valued at about US$250 trillion, meaning there is sufficient money to accelerate the green transition. The money is available from an increasingly wider pool - including an estimated US$6 trillion managed by 4,500 family offices globally. And there is a growing number of investment partnerships involving philanthropies that are co-investing with public and private sources of capital.

And so too, dealing with AI - the most profound technological change of our times, with benefits as well as risks that are likely to grow exponentially in the coming decade and beyond.</p><p>We can only address these long challenges by stretching our economic and political horizons. And by finding ways to rebuild optimism and solidarity within our societies, so that people can imagine how the future can be better for all. The collective belief in the future has to be both the means and the end.</p><p>Building a realistic optimism</p><p>We are starting from a difficult place. Confidence in the future has been on the decline in most societies. They are also more divided. A survey of 19 high and middle-income societies by Pew Research in 2022 found the majority feeling more divided than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Only three countries avoided this, including Singapore, where 75 per cent of people felt more united than before the pandemic. On top of all this, confidence in the multilateral order is at its lowest point.</p><p>Yet to tackle problems like climate change, we must first recognise the scale and seriousness of the challenge - not so we add to the mood of despondency, but so we build realistic optimism.</p><p>The world is far behind the actions it needs to stay within 1.5 degrees C of global warming, and to prevent accelerated warming after we hit 1.5 degrees. The best scientific estimates tell us that the remaining carbon budget, or the maximum amount of emissions the world can make so that global warming remains below 1.5 degrees, is likely to be used up in about five years' time.</p><p>Even more worrying: there is radical uncertainty as to what comes next. The planet is losing its critical buffers against warming - the natural ecosystems on land and in the oceans, that have been soaking up more than 50 per cent of carbon dioxide that the world emits, are losing that ability. It is also beginning to cross tipping points - such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and the shift in the Amazon from being a huge carbon sink to being a net emitter - which can lead to runaway global warming.</p><p>The implications are clear. First, tackling climate change will be much more costly, and vastly more complex and difficult, if we defer action. We must act early, especially to develop scale in clean energy and green technologies, so that they become as affordable and as reliable as what we do with fossil fuels.</p><p>Second, clear and credible public policies are key to achieving this scale and speed that is required. Carbon pricing has to be the centrepiece. It will help catalyse the needed shift in private investments towards green opportunities in every sector, and also provide the revenues needed to support the transition and ensure poorer segments of the population are not disadvantaged. But it is generally understood that carbon pricing, within socially realistic limits, will not on its own be adequate. Targeted regulations in specific sectors, which in many cases such as in aviation and maritime transport will have to be internationally managed, are needed to provide certainty for businesses and spur innovation.</p><p>We also need public investment in R&amp;D and to build out new grids and other public infrastructure for a clean energy future. But higher spending will be a problem in many countries - given already large public debts, and interest rates which are no longer low. They have to find a pragmatic path, to protect future generations from exploding debt burdens, but also protect them from the huge costs that climate change will cause.</p><p>Europe epitomizes this challenge. Eminent former leaders like Italy's Mario Draghi and Germany's Angela Merkel - who had herself pushed for Germany's conservative 'debt brake' laws when she was the country's Chancellor - have now proposed that the public sector be allowed to borrow for a transitional period for investments in the green transition and other critical needs.</p><p>Third, and the most challenging governance task: we need international coordination to solve the climate crisis. Otherwise we risk carbon leakage - where higher emitting companies and activities shift to countries with more accommodating policies. But besides their differing levels of political will, the complexity comes from the fact that countries have been using different sets of measures to encourage decarbonization. Europe has been relying on the full mix of carbon pricing, regulation and subsidies, whereas China has introduced only limited pricing and the US has eschewed it altogether. Finding some equivalence between the measures taken by these major emitters so as to determine their 'effective' carbon pricing rates will be a difficult matter. But it cannot be avoided.</p><p>Reframing the debate</p><p>We need a new understanding in trade, investments and technology transfers, to enable the world to benefit from China's low-cost clean energy technologies, such as its solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. And likewise, to take advantage of innovations in the United States, such as in hydrogen power, carbon capture and other next-generation clean technologies. The key goal must be to maximise scale, affordability and the speed of the global transition, recognising that the world is far behind in the race against climate change. It will be aided by not limiting market access to products and technologies based on where they come from, but instead pursuing the solutions that still exist for win-win economic outcomes.</p><p>We must also overcome the perennial tensions over climate financing for the developing world, which are not getting us anywhere. The debate has to be reframed, from viewing it not as a matter of how much aid should be given from rich nations to poor, but as investment in the global commons that all nations will benefit from. Dollar for dollar, investments in climate transition in the developing world in fact have a more significant impact on global emissions than in the advanced economies.</p><p>Blended finance, where we bring together monies from the public sector, the multilateral development banks and the private sector, and where possible philanthropies, is an important way to scale up these investments. That's why Singapore launched the FAST-P programme this year, to help spur the transition to low carbon in Asia.</p><p>The good news recently has been in carbon markets. Consensus on how to operationalise Article 6 of the Paris Agreement - governing how countries can trade carbon credits - was finally achieved at COP29 in Baku, with Singapore playing the role of co-facilitator. It will also add impetus to efforts to develop a voluntary carbon market with credible standards and verification mechanisms. The challenge is in the doing. An example is the Transition Credits Coalition that MAS is working on, to make possible an early phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Asia.</p><p>Finally, we need a new narrative on climate change, that has appeal to populations. Pushback has come from those who feel they have to bear the costs of decarbonisation today, in exchange for benefits to society in the distant future. Part of the solution must be to ensure that adjustments are fair to ordinary households. But decarbonising the economy can itself be a growth opportunity in the coming decade itself - with heightened investments creating many jobs and new businesses. It is an opportunity for clean air today - remember that millions of people each year die from air pollution caused by fossil fuel-based energy, with many more suffering from ill-health. And nature-based solutions will help give populations clean water supply, and provide a buffer against flood and other weather extremities. So while the largest benefits come decades later, the dividends for populations from climate action begin flowing early.</p><p>AI : focus on early wins, and avoiding the worst possible harms</p><p>The second looming issue is AI. It presents massive opportunities for improved well-being - from better healthcare to productivity in every sector. But there are also major risks. There are bleak scenarios of how AI will remove a large segment of jobs, including those of the middle class. No one can say for sure that it won't happen. There is also the prospect of AI systems moving beyond our control, as most AI programmes get to be written by AI itself. And as Henry Kissinger warned in his final book, AI poses a global security dilemma of an existential nature. More immediately, there's the risk that AI poses for democracy itself, by accentuating misinformation and social polarisation. We already see this today, but it will only grow in the next decade and beyond.</p><p>Yet we must have a sense of realism when we think of how we should regulate AI. There will remain a fundamental mismatch between the pace at which AI is developing and regulators' ability to set rules around it. We cannot delay AI until we are perfectly sure it is safe; in fact we should assume that there will be some bad. Our approach should be to maximise the benefits of AI and minimise the risk of the worst possible harms to safety and society, and not think we can regulate AI comprehensively to avoid all that could be bad.</p><p>Look for early wins. In healthcare, for instance, through much earlier and better diagnosis and treatment. In learning, with the potential that AI offers for personalised tutoring, through life. In improving farming yields. And in virtually every sector, to improve the productivity of those in the workforce by having an AI tool to augment your own capabilities.</p><p>Further, not every problem created by AI will be best solved by trying to regulate AI. The real solutions to avoid job and income losses, which could come in both advanced and developing countries, lie in other economic and social strategies. We've got to double down on preparing young people and the workforce of today for an AI era. Countries may have to introduce new wage subsidies, or use progressive tax and transfer systems to mitigate inequalities. Every society has to be ready with these strategies, to ensure we can benefit from AI whilst buffering its downsides.</p><p>Critically too, we will need international cooperation to govern AI. It must involve the US and China talking directly with each other. But we must carry on with the important work of building a broad coalition of interests that can make the most of expertise from every source.</p><p>Don't send the invoice to the next generation</p><p>The third long challenge: preserving optimism as societies age. Almost every higher income country is ageing, and a few emerging countries too. We will see this go further in the next thirty years, changing the nature of society.</p><p>However, many systems of financing healthcare and pensions are unsustainable, and are now likely to pose a major burden on the next generation. Unfortunately, most are also dealing with this challenge late in the day, when a large segment of the population is already retired or close to doing so. Reforms are still possible, but now come at greater political cost, which many democracies are finding insurmountable.</p><p>Healthcare spending will have to go up, if we are to provide quality and affordable care for growing older populations. The costs have to be paid for fairly, across a population. We should start by recognizing that there is no such thing as free health care for people anywhere - even in the systems like the UK where you pay little or nothing when you turn up in hospital, people pay for it through taxes or mandatory national insurance contributions</p><p>But a key lesson from most countries is that to keep the system fair, and keep healthcare costs from going up excessively, we have to avoid a heavy reliance on just one source of payments. We need a balance between government subsidies, co-payments by individuals when they are treated, and insurance policies - as we have in Singapore for example. It is also how we ensure that those who can afford it get less subsidies and pay their fair share.</p><p>More importantly, staying healthy and keeping healthcare costs down doesn't just depend on healthcare systems. In fact, much of it depends on our habits and the social environment around us as we age. Are we staying active? Do we have regular friends? Do we have hobbies? Are we still learning something and staying curious? Are we countering the ageing brain? That's all critical in staying healthy, and to living long and satisfying lives. And in Singapore, we are very serious about making this possible.</p><p>Rebuilding solidarity</p><p>Finally, as I mentioned at the start, we have to rebuild the collective belief that the future can be better for all. We have to find ways to get beyond the zero-sum thinking that is now prevalent within many societies - where each group feels that its future is pitched against another. Find ways to address the concerns of segments in each population who feel that the elite do not understand their day-to-day problems. And find ways to rebuild a sense of common humanity, by sustaining the international rule of law and norms of conduct, and by pitching in to strengthen the global commons.</p><p>Yet, solidarity, a sense that our lives are connected and indeed enriched by what we do for each other, is a neglected dimension of democracy. We understand very well the importance of justice, and the freedoms that different democracies are organised around, but it requires something more for democracies to work well in today's world. Where we're not just individuals wanting to be equal and free, but we have bonds of reciprocity with each other, and we know it's those bonds that will help us tackle the challenges we now face and take us forward.</p><p>Solidarity has to be rebuilt into how we practise democracy, how societies are governed, and how we respect each other in our lives.</p><p>This is an abridged version of a speech by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, in delivering the inaugural JY Pillay Lecture on Governance organised by the Singapore University of Social Sciences on 27 November 2024.</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: The Istana, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["But decarbonising the economy can itself be a growth opportunity in the coming decade itself - with heightened investments creating many jobs and new businesses.

In this scenario, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) could emerge as a regional market with member countries agreeing on a common set of quality principles and operating carbon trading among themselves, noted Rahman. </p><p> The third one is a fragmented market where countries trade carbon credits based on bilateral partnerships. In the context of Asean, this could mean the proliferation of bilateral agreements between countries willing to cooperate, rather than a regional market. </p><p> GenZero's chief executive officer Frederick Teo said that these scenarios are not predictions of where carbon markets would be headed, and that there is no preference over any of the three as there are both positives and negatives in each. </p><p> Instead, scenario planning involves understanding the various ways in which macroeconomic trends and geopolitics can shape carbon markets, and distil the \"no-regrets\" actions that carbon market participants and regulators can take today, noted Teo. </p><p> The three scenariosRegardless of which scenario will play out in the future, the report stated that carbon markets would have a role to play in decarbonisation in all three, though at varying degrees. </p><p> For the first scenario where countries collaborate to prioritise climate action, there would be vibrant carbon trading between standardised carbon markets, with a strong focus on high-quality solutions, and enough financing for costly breakthrough technologies. </p><p> Rahman noted that there would probably be a strong multilateral process in defining quality projects, with Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement -- which governs rules on an international carbon trading system -- being operationalised at scale and carbon prices trading higher in this scenario. </p><p> However, stringent requirements on quality, while helpful in weeding out low-integrity projects, will also reduce financing for solutions that rely on estimates to quantify its climate impact, such as nature-based solutions. These solutions are typically cheaper, more readily available, and can be implemented at scale. </p><p> This can eventually reduce the overall supply of carbon credits, and thereby the size of the voluntary carbon market as companies will be more liable to compliance mechanisms. </p><p> However, voluntary carbon markets will play a bigger role in scenarios where the world is ideologically divided into two power blocs, or fragmented by nationalistic interests. </p><p> An ideologically bifurcated carbon market will emerge in a divided world, with the western bloc -- led by the United States and Europe -- focusing on developing high-tech solutions, while the China-led eastern bloc will look at scaling up low-cost nature-based and community projects. </p><p> Carbon markets can eventually be an important bridge for climate collaboration between the power blocs, where trading occurs where their principles converge. </p><p> In the case of a fragmented world, governments will look towards carbon markets to channel financing towards under-funded climate solutions and remain one of the best ways to set a price on carbon. Countries will develop their own domestic carbon markets and trade bilaterally, though prices would vary significantly.</p><p> The lack of a central authority guarding the quality of carbon projects can be challenging for project developers located in jurisdictions lacking in climate ambition. Local carbon markets can go through boom-and-bust cycles when low-quality projects do not take off over integrity concerns. </p><p> Narrow definitions on quality climate solutionsTeo said that the report does not attempt to define what constitutes a quality carbon project. But it seeks to highlight the trade-offs involved in such concerns. These typically revolve around price, technological readiness and the durability of the solution. </p><p> \"If you take a particularly restrictive definition around this, if the (solution) does not last for 1,000 years then it is not good enough -- and therefore will not be accepted -- then those solutions that can be good for 100 years will be priced out,\" he said.</p><p> \"Then those things that can help us address the climate crisis and buy us time to the end of the century will not be funded and will not work.\" </p><p> While there needs to be a minimum level of quality to preserve confidence in the market, the report noted that there needs to be an appreciation of the practical realities that may not be able to satisfy the requirements if a very high bar is set. </p><p> Ongoing integrity concerns in the carbon market have led to a decrease in prices of carbon credits, and the size of the voluntary market over the last year.</p><p> Hence, the report argues that carbon markets need greater regulatory oversight by governments and standard setters to ensure alignment on a set of quality principles for market participants to have a common base when evaluating the pricing and quality of projects. Still, they should not be overly prescriptive. </p><p> There also needs to be better understanding of how carbon markets can support a company's decarbonisation plan, and the claims that companies can make when using offsets, so that there can be clearer demand signals. </p><p> In the context of Asean, how carbon markets evolve in the region will depend on member states' ability to meet their net-zero targets as well as willingness to cooperate, said Rahman. </p><p> \"Irrespective of how global trends evolve, Asean can better leverage carbon markets through well-designed policies that clarify the role of carbon markets in decarbonisation, and harness digital technologies for environmental integrity,\" he noted.</p><p> \"Corporates in the region can take steps to identify where carbon markets best fit within their sustainability and decarbonisation strategy.

At the same time, Singapore's reinsurance premiums grew 31% year-on-year to S$27.6 billion in 2023, accounting for about 21% of Asia's reinsurance market.</p><p>4. This comes on the back of a resilient global reinsurance industry.</p><p>a. Global reinsurance capital has grown by 3.7% since end 2023 to reach a new high of US$695 billion in the first half of 2024, a level not seen since 2021.[1]</p><p>b. This was driven by retained earnings, more disciplined underwriting, and improved investment performance.</p><p>c. The industry has returned to profitability, with reinsurers' return on equity reaching 17.6% in the first half of 2024.[2]</p><p>5. This puts the reinsurance industry in a strong position to support the growth of Asia, as it navigates four key transitions in the years ahead - namely, climate, energy, digital, and demographic.</p><p>Climate transition</p><p>6. I will start with the climate transition. This is something which the insurance industry is familiar with, given its traditional role in providing natural catastrophe insurance coverage.</p><p>7. It is not so much that climate change is happening, but the pace at which it is accelerating which is of increasing concern. This is in turn challenging risk projections based off historical data.</p><p>a. In the past five years, annual insured losses from natural catastrophes averaged US$106 billion, up from less than US$83 billion in the previous five-year period.[3]</p><p>b. Latest models indicate the insurance industry needs to be prepared for an average annual insured loss of US$151 billion, or higher.[4]</p><p>8. Asia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It also suffers from a significant protection gap, particularly in terms of catastrophe coverage.</p><p>a. Total economic losses in the Asia-Pacific region for 2023 amounted to US$65 billion, of which 91% was not insured. This compares with a 30% protection gap in the United States.[5]</p><p>b. Based on the current trajectory, global temperatures are expected to increase by about 2.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels without more aggressive actions. Under this scenario, Asia could lose about 20% of its GDP by 2048 from 2021 levels, whilst ASEAN collectively could lose about 29% of its GDP.[6]</p><p>9. There is therefore both an imminent need and opportunity for the insurance industry to address the underinsurance gap arising from climate change, even as the world scrambles to mitigate the global impact of climate change.</p><p>a. To do so, the industry will need to work closely with governments, academia and technology providers, to enhance its risk models, scenario analysis and data on the physical impact of climate change in Asia.</p><p>b. I therefore encourage the insurance industry to tap on Singapore's growing applied climate risk research ecosystem.</p><p>i. Singapore has close to 10 institutions[7] which provide research and insights on the physical impact of climate risk and related issues in the region, such as sea level rise, extreme weather events, climate impact modelling, and nature-based solutions.</p><p>ii. Insurers, risk modelling firms, and brokers can leverage the work of these institutions as a foundation to layer on economic impact assessments, data and risk models, and hence enhance their assessments, disclosures and portfolio risk management strategies.</p><p>c. With these analyses, the industry can also better advise clients how to reduce their risk - for example, manufacturers could raise their factory floor, install flood barriers or elevate critical machinery above base flood elevation, in anticipation of frequent flooding as a result of sea level rising.</p><p>d. In turn, this will enable the industry to offer tailored products to provide sustainably priced, effective insurance coverage against natural catastrophes over the longer term.</p><p>Energy Transition</p><p>10. Let me move on to the energy transition.</p><p>11. Unlocking renewable sources of energy is key to enabling Asia to grow its economies while transitioning towards net-zero.</p><p>a. Asia accounts for half of global greenhouse gas emissions, as most of its energy needs today are being met through fossil fuels, including coal.</p><p>b. Moreover, much of Asia is developing, and its energy needs are still rising.</p><p>c. It is critical that we catalyse investments into renewable energy generation and transmission.</p><p>i. In fact, investments in renewable energy generation in Asia Pacific are poised to double during the current decade to US$1.3 trillion by 2030.[8]</p><p>1. This comprises a sizeable pipeline of renewable energy infrastructure projects, including solar, hydropower and wind.</p><p>ii. To enhance electricity connectivity within ASEAN, the International Energy Agency estimates that an overall grid investment of about $21 billion annually is needed from 2026 to 2030 and a further $31 billion annually from 2031 to 2035[9].</p><p>12. Amidst the energy transition, there are opportunities for specialty insurers and reinsurers to step up risk financing and insurance solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies.</p><p>a. It is estimated that Asia Pacific will account for a quarter, or US$59 billion of cumulative global renewable energy insurance premiums between 2022 and 2035.[10]</p><p>13. Yet compared to natural catastrophe insurance, there is less historical track record of risk assessment and loss profiles for renewable energy development in Asia.</p><p>a. Such projects will also be exposed to risks from potential damage from physical elements, such as heavy winds and storms, as well as the additional risk arising from the integration of energy storage systems with renewables.</p><p>b. To bridge these gaps, the industry must work closely with the renewable energy sector to develop new risk assessment frameworks, risk engineering methodologies, and sector-specific solutions.</p><p>c. This will improve the financial viability, risk management, and resilience of renewable energy and decarbonisation projects in the region.</p><p>14. There is also room to deploy solutions such as parametric insurance covers, as well as pre- Final Investment Decision, or pre-FID, insurance solutions[11], such as technology performance guarantees[12] and counter-party credit covers[13].</p><p>a. Parametric insurance covers can address specific coverage needs which may not be supported by traditional insurance, given the highly customisable nature.</p><p>i. MAS is studying ways to support the growth of parametric insurance, including through research on the regulatory treatment of such solutions in the region as well as information on independent and reliable data resources.</p><p>b. I encourage the industry to study pre-FID stage insurance solutions for projects in Asia, especially where projects are facing uncertainties.</p><p>i. This is a nascent space in the region, and there is room for the industry to innovate and pilot solutions offering protection during critical early stages of project development.</p><p>15. Insurers can also support the energy transition by investing directly in green infrastructure.</p><p>a. In fact, insurers are some of the world's largest institutional investors, holding more than US$40 trillion in assets.[14] In the Asia-Pacific, insurance assets are estimated to be about US$10 trillion.[15]</p><p>b. The long duration of infrastructure investments makes such assets a good match for the long-term liabilities of say life insurers.</p><p>c. To facilitate greater allocation of assets to infrastructure, MAS had recently issued a public consultation proposing a differentiated capital treatment for infrastructure assets that meet certain criteria to enjoy diversification benefits or lower risk charges than other debt and equity assets.</p><p>d. MAS will also be piloting a differentiated risk capital treatment for insurers' investments in environmentally sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>i. This allows insurers in Singapore to build their experience and capabilities in investing in sustainable infrastructure assets, and to gain deeper exposure to such assets.</p><p>ii. We will share more details of this pilot soon.</p><p>16. Taken together, these moves can potentially unlock Asia's sizable infrastructure investment gap, which is estimated at US$815 billion annually.[16]</p><p>Digital transition</p><p>17. I will touch on the digital transition next.</p><p>18. By 2030, the digital economy in the Asia-Pacific is expected to reach $2 trillion or more, driven by factors such as -</p><p>a. The boom in e-commerce, especially in countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam;</p><p>b. Innovations in fintech, especially digital payments; and</p><p>c. AI and cloud services, as businesses invest in these technologies to drive innovation.</p><p>19. At the same time, the risks associated with cyber threats will also increase. This will in turn drive the demand for the cyber insurance market in Asia.</p><p>a. The Asia-Pacific cyber insurance market is estimated to double from 2023 to 2027[17], as companies seek coverage for data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other cyber threats.</p><p>b. Reinsurers are developing more sophisticated cyber risk models to address this evolving threat.</p><p>i. For example, we have seen the industry develop dynamic cyber risk underwriting based on monitoring platforms making real-time risk assessments.</p><p>c. In tandem, I urge the industry to work with businesses and consumers to put in place robust cybersecurity measures.</p><p>i. Such ex-ante mitigation can help insurers better manage cyber risks, while encouraging businesses to adopt best-in-class systems and practices from the get-go.</p><p>Demographic transitions</p><p>20. Last but not least, the changing demographics in Asia - in particular, a combination of ageing populations, urbanisation, and increasing wealth - will fuel the demand for life and health reinsurance.</p><p>a. Many countries in Asia, such as China, Japan and South Korea, are experiencing rapidly aging populations. Singapore is no exception - we project to attain 'super-aged' status by 2026, with about one fifth of our population aged 65 years or older.</p><p>b. At the same time, life expectancy is expected to increase. This will drive demand for long-term healthcare, pensions and financial products that provide security in old age.</p><p>c. Likewise, the rise of the middle class in Asia, coupled with greater urbanisation, will fuel greater demand for life insurance, health insurance and savings-related products.</p><p>d. These trends will give rise to growing liabilities, and reinsurers can share the risk associated with longer lifespans and rising medical costs.</p><p>e. The rise of digital platforms and insurance technology - or InsurTech - will also increase the reach of insurers. This expansion in coverage will lead to a higher volume of complex risk, and therefore the opportunity for reinsurance to manage the risk portfolio.</p><p>f. Asia accounts for 39% of the global life market, and is expected to grow by over 5% annually over the next decade, outpacing the global average[18].</p><p>Growing Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub</p><p>21. I have outlined four transitions in Asia that will drive the demand for reinsurance - climate; energy; digital; and demographics.</p><p>22. Amidst this demand growth, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub.</p><p>23. First, we will double down on developing a marketplace of insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>a. Today, Singapore serves as the Asia-Pacific hub for 12 top global insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>b. Among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 reinsurers in the world have made Singapore their regional hub, covering not just ASEAN, but also markets in North and South Asia and even Australia.</p><p>c. We also have a well-developed network of about 150 brokers in Singapore today.</p><p>d. We encourage insurers to expand their presence in Singapore -</p><p>i. By leveraging our concentration of underwriting expertise here, including in complex property, casualty and specialty lines; and</p><p>ii. By building on the databases and models available, such as on climate change that I had spoken about earlier.</p><p>e. By strengthening our ecosystem of insurers, reinsurers and brokers, we can position Singapore as the hub for the development of risk financing solutions for Asia.</p><p>24. Second, we will work with insurers and reinsurers in Singapore to deepen their capabilities, in particular in AI.</p><p>a. There is good potential for the insurance industry to harness AI to improve productivity, customer service, and core operations including underwriting, actuarial analysis, and claims processing.</p><p>i. For example, it is estimated that generative AI can boost the insurance industry's revenues by 20% and cut their costs by 15%.[19]</p><p>b. To support the scaling of AI with confidence, Singapore is developing a strong foundation of AI governance that balances the need for innovation with the responsible use of AI.</p><p>i. In this regard, MAS is working in partnership with leading insurers here under Project MindForge to develop a risk framework for the responsible use of GenAI for insurance use cases, including in AI-assisted underwriting and customer engagement.</p><p>ii. MAS will also be issuing a set of good practices next year for addressing AI model, technology and cyber risks.</p><p>c. In tandem, we must build up our talent pool to harness the potential of AI.</p><p>i. MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance have commissioned a Jobs Transformation Map study on how GenAI will change job roles in the financial sector, and to identify the new skillsets needed. We will publish the findings and recommendations early next year.</p><p>d. I encourage the insurance industry to tap on the guidance and support available to develop and deepen your AI capabilities.</p><p>25. Third, we will continue to expand insurance capacity through alternative risk transfer instruments.</p><p>a. One such example is sovereign insurance solutions.</p><p>i. Singapore is part of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (or SEA-DRIF), an ASEAN+3 initiative in partnership with the World Bank to provide climate and disaster risk insurance solutions for the region.</p><p>ii. SEADRIF has made US$4.5 million in payouts to support flood response in Laos, including a US$3 million payout in September 2024 following Typhoon Yagi.</p><p>b. Another example is insurance-linked securities (ILS).</p><p>i. Singapore is supporting the development of ILS markets in Asia to unlock additional risk financing capacity for peak catastrophe risks.</p><p>1. Of the 28 catastrophe bond issuances[20] in Singapore over the past 5 years, 13 issuances have covered perils in Asia, providing US$1.6 billion in coverage.</p><p>2. Whilst this is a good start, Asia currently accounts for less than 5% of the global catastrophe bond market.</p><p>ii. With their strong credit rating, good in-country relationships and sovereign support programmes, multilateral development banks can bring scale to ILS issuances in Asia by partnering sovereigns on programmatic issuances.</p><p>1. For example, they can provide a ready platform from which to issue catastrophe bonds, offering faster time to market and cost savings compared to individual countries building issuance capabilities on their own.</p><p>iii. There is opportunity to channel some of the growing flow of investments from private wealth and institutional investors in Asia towards ILS - and to this end, MAS is partnering with the ILS industry to promote ILS as an asset class for private wealth and investment portfolios.</p><p>c. Through such alternative risk transfer instruments, we can unlock additional risk financing capacity, and complement that provided by traditional insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. Let me conclude. As Asia undergoes four fundamental transitions in the years ahead, there are opportunities for the reinsurance industry to play a key role in its growth and development, to insure a dynamic, sustainable and resilient Asia.</p><p>27. Through strengthening our insurance ecosystem, deepening capabilities, including in AI, and developing alternative risk transfer markets in Asia, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub.</p><p>28.

SGX Group is part of the 1,200-strong TNFD Forum, which helped develop the beta version of the framework released in March 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The TNFD's 14 disclosure recommendations aim to inform better decision-making by companies and capital providers, and ultimately contribute to a shift in global financial flows towards \"nature-positive outcomes\" and the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which was borne out of the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP 15) in December 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TNFD says its recommendations build on those of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and are consistent with the global sustainability standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board.</p><p>Although the TNFD establishes a voluntary reporting framework, it could quickly become a market standard, much like the TCFD became the global baseline for corporate climate disclosure, say Arne Klug, Gillian Mollod and Sylvain Vanston, research analysts from MSCI ESG &amp; Climate Research.</p><p>\"Currently, consistent data on nature and biodiversity is scarce, which affects models that depend on it,\" says the MSCI team. \"By design, the TNFD takes its approach from the TCFD. Both initiatives are designed to harness risk management and disclosure to help channel capital towards sustainable outcomes.\"</p><p>The TNFD framework extends the TCFD's four pillars - governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets - to nature. The TNFD includes a core set of 14 indicators for reporting across sectors, together with recommendations for sector-specific reporting. The framework also recommends a set of additional disclosure metrics.</p><p>Businesses and investors who want to be TNFD-aligned would, at minimum, report data for the core disclosure metrics, say Klug, Mollod and Vanston in a Sept 21 note.</p><p>British pharmaceutical and biotechnology giant GSK, formerly GlaxoSmithKline, has announced plans to publish their first TNFD disclosures from 2026, based on 2025 data.

The TNFD framework aims to provide guidance on how to reduce those gaps in the future.\"</p><p>Though challenges remain, the TNFD adds impetus to the standardisation of nature-related financial reporting, they add. \"The inaugural framework offers companies, investors and financial institutions a new global baseline for measuring and reporting biodiversity-related risks, dependencies and impacts.\"</p><p>Nature-based solutions</p><p>The science is clear - there is going to be no path to reach global climate goals without unlocking the power of nature-based solutions, says Thomas Brzostowski, interim Singapore country director at The Nature Conservancy (TNC).</p><p>\"It's just that simple and that important. Forests, wetlands, grasslands, mangroves and other ecosystems serve as these vital carbon sinks, and protecting these ecosystems, restoring degraded habitats and supporting farmers and landowners with regenerative land-use practices have the potential to realise about one-third of the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming and keep the climate within safe boundaries,\" says Brzostowski in his keynote speech at the Singapore Carbon Market and Investor Forum on July 19.</p><p>Such natural assets play a really critical role in helping to protect people and coastal infrastructure from the increasingly severe impacts of climate change, rising sea level storms and more, he adds. \"However, only about 8% of global climate investment currently goes to nature-based solutions for climate, despite being a third of the solution.\"</p><p>The global environmental non-profit group officially expanded into Singapore in July, growing its Asia-Pacific network that already spans Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, New Zealand, Mongolia and Myanmar.</p><p>Supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, TNC says its new office at The Great Room in the Afro-Asia Building will serve as a strategic global centre for partnerships, innovation and scientific research, focused on addressing the \"interconnected crises\" of climate change and biodiversity loss.</p><p>Over the past 70 years, TNC has helped to \"protect and improve the management of [some] 125 million acres or 50 million hectares of land\", says Brzostowski, \"about the size of Spain\". \"But we know we need to do more, faster. The world has years, not decades, to tackle the integrated biodiversity and climate crises.\"</p><p>Brzostowski, who has been with TNC since 2016, moved from New Zealand to set up the Singapore office. Here, TNC aims to drive sustainable solutions by supporting the growth of a \"high-integrity market\" for nature-based solutions like carbon credits.</p><p>Through the Southeast Asia Climate and Nature-based Solutions Coalition, TNC and seven other environmental and conservation non-profit groups across Southeast Asia are accelerating the adoption of nature-based solutions in the region.</p><p>By partnering trading companies and the finance sector, TNC says it will help address \"commodity-driven land conversion\", such as the clearing of forests, peatlands, mangroves and other natural areas for agriculture.</p><p>Finally, TNC hopes to collaborate with leading academic and research institutions \"to deepen the understanding of nature's role in addressing climate change\".</p><p>\"Over the next few years, more and more investors will be asking how businesses plan to support the [Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity] Framework, targets and transition strategies towards promoting nature-positive outcomes,\" says Brzostowski. \"Publicly disclosing progress against science-aligned targets and setting supportive global climate and biodiversity goals is a critical part of the integrity of environmental markets. Thankfully, there are a number of initiatives growing around the world to help companies navigate this very complex and ever-evolving space.\"</p><p>Investing in 'biodiversity champions'</p><p>Compared to the work of the TCFD, which aims to standardise the reporting of emissions, putting a single number to biodiversity loss is more challenging, says Sonya Likhtman of US-headquartered investment manager Federated Hermes. \"There are lots of issues, and bio-diversity can mean a very different thing, depending on the company.\"</p><p>But there are lots of things that can be measured, adds Likhtman. She lists the five main drivers of biodiversity loss: changes in land and sea use, direct exploitation of species, climate change, pollution and invasive alien species.</p><p>\"Carbon is still an important metric that's related to biodiversity. You can't just do carbon by itself; you have to also look at water, waste, deforestation and land use change,\" she says. \"It's about choosing the metrics that are most material to that company or sector and that's what the TFND is working towards.\"</p><p>Likhtman is lead engager for the firm's Biodiversity Equity Fund and also works in EOS, the stewardship and engagement team at Federated Hermes. \"We engage on behalf of our own funds, and also on behalf of a set of external stewardship clients.\"</p><p>At these meetings, her agenda is shaped by what is material to each company. \"Sometimes we have an engagement that's focused on one issue, and it's a real deep-dive with an expert in that company; sometimes it's a higher level, maybe we're meeting a board or management member.\"</p><p>The F&amp;B industry, in particular, is highly dependent on biodiversity and ecosystem services, says Likhtman. \"Agricultural systems, healthy soils, water flow, a stable climate, pollinators - all of those ecosystem services are so valuable to the industry. So, there's a business imperative to act to ensure the long-term availability of these inputs from nature.\"</p><p>Here, Federated Hermes touts its Biodiversity Equity Fund. Launched in April 2022, it is the only global fund that invests in \"biodiversity champions\", says fund manager Ingrid Kukuljan. \"In our opinion, biodiversity loss poses the biggest systemic threat to our planet, and we believe that businesses that are addressing this problem will be the long-term winners as they are exposed to scalable and secular growth factors.\"</p><p>As of March 31, its top five holdings are: Tetra Tech (5.58%), Aecom (5.52%), Tomra Systems (4.74%), Kerry (4.67%) and Brambles (4.29%).</p><p>New York Stock Exchange-listed Aecom and Nasdaq-listed Tetra Tech are leading global providers of professional infrastructure consulting services, says Kukuljan. They provide solutions to land and water pollution, as well as the encroachment of the built environment on biodiversity, she adds.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oslo-listed Tomra Systems is a global solutions provider that minimises waste in the food, recycling and mining industries, says Kukuljan. \"Tomra has a large installed base worldwide with 81,000 reverse vending machines, about 13,000 food sorting installations, 8,200 recycling units and 190 mining machines.\"</p><p>Dublin- and London-listed Kerry is a leading developer of taste and nutrition solutions for the F&amp;B and pharmaceutical markets. Kerry's supply chain impacts biodiversity, and some raw materials pose a higher risk of tropical deforestation, says Kukuljan. \"These include palm oil, soy, coffee and cocoa.\"</p><p>In turn, Kerry has committed to a number of 2025 targets, including no deforestation across \"high-risk supply chains\" and 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging. For palm oil, soy, coffee and cocoa, 100% of direct volumes will be deforestation- and conversion-free by end-2025, notes Kukuljan.</p><p>Forest conversion is the clearing of natural forests to use the land for another purpose, such as agriculture, mining or urban development.</p><p>Finally, Australia-listed Brambles operates the world's largest pool of reusable pallets, crates and containers through a \"share and reuse\" model, says Kukuljan, which enables a circular economy and reduces demand for natural resources. \"The average lifespan of a Brambles pallet is 10 years, in comparison to under one year for white wood.\" White wood refers to general exchange, non-rental pallets.</p><p>Conservation and nature financing has histor\u00adically been the remit of public finance, says Likhtman, and the role of private finance was not always recognised. \"But there is a huge gap in how much needs to be financed and [this is] an important role for private finance to play.\"</p><p>The most important point is to get started, she adds. \"We can't wait until we've solved climate change to get going on biodiversity. These are issues that go hand-in-hand and they're very closely interlinked  So, raising the topic with companies is already very impactful. What are you doing about the risks associated with biodiversity loss? How are you thinking about your impacts and dependencies on nature and ecosystem services?

In 2014, it was announced that both gardens would be combined with Jurong Lake Park (now known as Lakeside Garden) to form Jurong Lake Gardens, and serve as the centrepiece of modern Jurong. Following extensive public consultation, rejuvenation works began in 2019 to sensitively enhance Chinese and Japanese Gardens, while preserving their natural ambience and distinctive cultural character. Tropical horticulture was another key focus, with the landscaping and planting palette carefully curated to bring out the colours and textures of the tropics.</p><p>Chinese Garden</p><p>Familiar landmarks that are synonymous with Chinese Garden, such as the Grand Arch, Cloud Pagoda, Twin Pagoda, Bonsai Garden, Stoneboat and Tea Pavilion, have been retained and spruced up with verdant landscaping and new amenities such as the Jurong Lake Gardens Gallery and Bonsai Gallery.</p><p>Furthermore, visitors can explore various newly added features, including the Cascading Creek, a riverine habitat with a boardwalk to showcase the different flora and fauna found along the river of a typical Southeast Asian forest, Water Wall Court, a serene courtyard enveloped by 3 m-high waterfalls, and Harvest Moon Terrace, which mirrors the Silver Moon Terrace at Japanese Garden across the lake, and features picturesque waterfront cabanas adorned with lanterns that are lit nightly.</p><p>The addition of the new Pagoda Plaza and Ficus Lawn also provides more open spaces for community events and gatherings amidst nature.</p><p>Japanese Garden</p><p>Highlights at the rejuvenated Japanese Garden include new curated gardens that interweave greenery with waterscapes, such as the Water Lily Garden, which houses the largest collection of water lilies in Singapore, and Sunken Garden, a valley-like garden with vertical green walls and a cenote[1]-inspired water feature.</p><p>Visitors can get closer to nature by venturing through a rustic trail lined with seasonal flowering trees at the Floral Ridge, or immersing themselves in the tranquillity of a Japanese-inspired garden at the Floral Garden.</p><p>Japanese Garden also has a variety of indoor and sheltered spaces suitable for large-scale and intimate events, such as the Guesthouse, a multi-purpose hall made of mass-engineered timber that can accommodate up to 1,000 people, as well as the adjacent Guest Pavilion and Teahouse. Visitors can also retreat to the Breathing Gallery, an indoor vivarium[2] showcasing terrestrial and aquatic species in terrariums, aquariums and paludariums.</p><p>Altogether, the rejuvenated Chinese and Japanese Gardens will complement Lakeside Garden's existing offerings, providing the public with even more recreational options within the first national gardens in the heartlands.</p><p>New and existing features at the Gardens commemorated in SingPost stamp series</p><p>Singapore Post Limited (SingPost) will be launching the Jurong Lake Gardens stamp series, which showcases four new and existing features at the Gardens - the Grand Arch at Chinese Garden, Water Lily Garden and Guesthouse at Japanese Garden, and Rasau Walk at Lakeside Garden.</p><p>From 9 September 2024, members of the public can purchase the Jurong Lake Gardens stamp series at the General Post Office, all philatelic stores and online at: shop.singpost.com.</p><p>Continued focus on sustainability</p><p>The rejuvenated Chinese and Japanese Gardens continue the Garden's emphasis on sustainability, with solutions that contribute towards greener outcomes and efficient operations.

During NParks' public engagement exercise from November 2016 to April 2017, over 14,000 suggestions were gathered for Jurong Lake Gardens Central (now known as Chinese and Japanese Gardens) and East, and incorporated into their design where feasible. NParks also took into consideration suggestions from industry stakeholders and practitioners on how best to sensitively carry out the rejuvenation works.</p><p>Various features within Chinese and Japanese Gardens also exemplify community stewardship. For instance, at the Floral Garden at Japanese Garden, NParks also worked with JTC to develop the design concept and partnered students from the ITE College East, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Singapore Polytechnic, as well as volunteers from Friends of Jurong Lake Gardens to design and co-create five community plots.</p><p>In addition, residents, volunteers from Friends of Jurong Lake Gardens and Nature Kakis Network, and donors contributed to the greening of Chinese and Japanese Gardens by supporting tree planting efforts on site, which also furthers the OneMillionTrees movement to plant one million more trees throughout the island.</p><p>Furthermore, the strong support of donors has been key in helping the Gardens take shape. A key partner is Tote Board, who enabled the development of key features across the Gardens through its funding support, including SkatePark @ Lakeside Garden, the Ficus Lawn at Chinese Garden, and the Guesthouse and Teahouse at Japanese Garden. Additionally, Micron Technology donated S$1 million through the Garden City Fund, NParks' registered charity and IPC, towards supporting the Gardens' sustainability efforts through the implementation of a smart water management system that helps clean and restore the water in the Water Lily Garden and the larger Japanese Garden. Donations from Mr Jimmy Koh and Mr Han Jok Kwang also contributed towards the development of Chinese and Japanese Gardens.</p><p>Largest edition of Lights by the Lake, with over 300 lanterns on display</p><p>From 8 to 22 September 2024, the third and largest edition of Lights by the Lake will be held at the Gardens, with the festivities spanning Chinese and Japanese Gardens as well as Lakeside Garden. Hand-crafted lanterns depicting Chinese folklore and the Gardens' biodiversity will be displayed and lit at night, with over 300 lanterns in total - the most number of lanterns displayed to date.</p><p>Visitors of all ages can look forward to a myriad of exciting activities and programmes, including dazzling light shows, movie screenings, cultural performances, funfair games and a food market. As part of the festivities, the NParks Concert Series in the Park: Rockestra will also return to the Gardens for the first time since 2019, with a medley of popular Mandarin, English and hits performed by local artistes.</p><p>Lights by the Lake 2024 will feature activities in support of the President's Challenge this year. To support the President's Challenge, members of the public can purchase 3D-printed souvenirs, floating water lanterns and solar-powered tulips, which will be available for sale at the festival.

At the same time, the nation's financial institutions have been active in making climate-aligned investments. Until recently there has been a focus on the role that nature-based solutions can play in addressing climate change, but the broader importance of nature to local and global economies is now receiving increased attention. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Around the world, we are witnessing the rapid degradation of natural capital assets such as clean waters, healthy soils and carbon-storing rainforests. In Singapore, we recently saw an oil spill that deposited more than 400 tonnes of fuel into the city's waters and onto its beaches, forcing tourism and recreational-activities operators to shut down as a massive cleanup effort got under way. Had the spill been larger, it is not hard to see it having a catastrophic impact on local businesses and supply chains.</p><p> Understanding the new realityAs companies increasingly grapple with understanding and responding to their exposure to nature loss, the scale of the nature-repair task is daunting. The United Nations' Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework sets a target of US$200 billion funding per year to be spent on nature repair by 2030. In response, the global financial sector is urgently considering the part it will play in providing the finance that is required. </p><p> The issue is particularly acute in South-east Asia, which is home to much of the natural capital that is under threat and where many businesses are highly exposed to supply-chain risks from regional nature damage. Despite this, the task of financing the shift to nature-positive business practices also represents a huge opportunity for Singapore, as the finance and commercial hub of the region. </p><p> The Singapore Green Finance Centre and Pollination recently hosted a roundtable for the city's leading financiers to share how they are responding to the need for nature investment, what challenges and opportunities they are seeing, and what changes might be needed to increase the flow of finance.</p><p> As a largely public good, nature has not provided a traditional commercial return unless it is being exploited. Nature management and conservation have almost exclusively been the preserve of governments, philanthropists, and conservation groups. Given the scale of finance required, valuing the preservation and repair of nature in real economic terms is now fundamental and private sector financing will be key.</p><p> Our roundtable discussion made clear that finance sector leaders understand this new reality. Those gathered were already engaged in high-level discussions about how to respond to the emerging demand for nature investment. </p><p> We were energised by the determination to lead in the space -- seen as necessary for Singapore to maintain its status as a global finance hub -- but also saw a sector looking for partnerships and enabling policy to guide how and where to direct its resources.</p><p> While we can see the impact that reporting and disclosure frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) have had on putting nature on the corporate agenda, moving beyond reporting and compliance relies on investors securing a return from nature investing or gaining a greater understanding of how nature investing can protect future economic stability and company returns.</p><p> We heard from finance sector leaders looking for government signals and settings to help establish clearer local and regional direction, including a desire for regional bodies, such as Asean, to be active in establishing rules, metrics and tools for the nature shift.</p><p> Overwhelmingly, there was support for Singapore playing a lead role in financing nature, just as it has done with establishing climate finance and carbon markets. One change worth considering might be for governments to require companies to report on their nature-related risks based on a TNFD framework, just as they now do in Singapore for climate. </p><p> Ultimately, governments may need to think about imposing obligations on companies to manage their impact on nature and make mandatory investments to ensure their operations are nature-positive. There could also be a potential role for public funding incentives to encourage large-scale private nature investment.</p><p> Hungry for the right toolsOne challenge that many of our participants named was the lack of agreed metrics, available data and a shared taxonomy for financing nature. It is often said that \"you can't be what you can't see\". It is just as difficult, though, to repair what you cannot measure, or to invest in something that does not have an agreed value.</p><p> Financiers are hungry for the tools and understanding they will need to \"turn on the tap\" and let nature finance flow in a way that can deliver better-understood returns for investors and for the environment. This includes research and case studies, standards for identifying and measuring natural capital, as well as the regulatory infrastructure to allow for frictionless comparison, translation, and trading across regional jurisdictions, so that finance can flow to where it is most needed.</p><p> While frameworks such as the TNFD and Science Based Targets initiative have been helpful, the discussion called out the fact that such frameworks often emerge from Western economies and flagged the need for rules and guidance that better reflect Asian contexts.</p><p> All of this is important, but the task at hand is urgent and we do not have time to wait for ideal conditions before getting started. The most important thing is to stop waiting and start financing, course-correcting along the way as new research, data and cases emerge.

Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"</p><p>2. The Sewerage and Drainage Act, or SDA for short, was enacted in 1999, and the last Sewerage and Drainage (Amendment) Bill was in 2012. The SDA provides powers to regulate the construction, maintenance, improvement, operation and use of sewerage and drainage systems, and the discharge of sewage and trade effluent.</p><p>3. Over the past decades, the SDA has allowed PUB to regulate discharges into our sewerage system. This ensures that the used water received at our Water Reclamation Plants, or WRPs, can be effectively and efficiently treated and sent to the NEWater Factories for further treatment to produce NEWater. NEWater, an ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water, plays a critical role in Singapore's water supply. It is delivered to key customers like wafer fabrication plants and is also used to top up our reservoirs during dry spells.</p><p>4. We have also taken steps to improve our stormwater drainage system over the years. In 2008, we completed the Marina Reservoir by damming up the Singapore River. This alleviated flooding in the low-lying areas in the city centre and provided us with a new source of catchment water. Over the years, we have continued to develop innovative drainage solutions. Just this September, we marked the opening of Alkaff Lake at Bidadari Park, which not only functions as a stormwater retention pond to prevent floods in the Bidadari Estate during heavy rain, but also serves as a recreational space to bring people closer to water.</p><p>5. But our work is not done. Findings from Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study, or V3 study, project that Singapore will see longer and more frequent dry spells by 2100, averaging one every 10 to 60 months. We also expect more extreme daily rainfall across all seasons which will increase the likelihood of flash floods. As a weather-resilient National Tap less affected by dry spells, NEWater's importance will thus grow, and we must take further steps to protect the quality of our used water which affects how we are able to treat it into NEWater. We will also need to ensure that our stormwater drainage system continues to be protected and kept in good working order, so that it can withstand more frequent extreme weather events.</p><p>6. Our proposed amendments to the SDA seek to achieve these two objectives: Better secure our used water system and in turn safeguard the production of NEWater; and also enhance our flood resilience by better protecting the stormwater drainage system and keeping it in proper working order.</p><p>7. We will also introduce amendments related to PUB's operations, to better support their operational needs as Singapore's National Water Agency.</p><p>8. Let me elaborate on each group of amendments.</p><p>SECURING OUR USED WATER SYSTEM</p><p>9. First, on securing our used water system.</p><p>10. Singapore has an extensive sewerage system with about 3,600 km of sewers and 48 km of Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, or DTSS. As Singapore develops further, our sewerage system will also expand. Last year, PUB completed tunnelling works for Phase 2 of the DTSS, comprising 98 km of deep tunnels and link sewers. Our sewerage system channels used water from industries and households to our water reclamation plants which provide the treated used water as feedstock to our NEWater factories to produce NEWater.</p><p>11. To better secure our NEWater supply, we must: Leverage technology to better protect the sewerage system; and take stronger actions against illegal discharges.</p><p>2.1 Leverage technology to better protect the sewerage system</p><p>12. A key feature of the Bill is to support the use of technology to better protect our sewerage system.</p><p>13. General Waste Collectors, or GWCs, collect sewage, greasy waste and organic sludge for disposal at WRPs. Their tankers need to be registered with PUB annually and they are only allowed to collect authorised waste.</p><p>14. However, some GWCs may illegally collect unauthorised waste or dispose any collected waste directly into sewers instead of our WRPs to avoid paying for the costs of treatment or disposal. In 2021, PUB investigated two such cases, but the cases could not be established as PUB was unable to verify their collection routes.</p><p>15. To deter such illegal actions, Clause 42 amends Section 74 to empower regulations to be made to impose requirements for these tankers to be installed with tracking and locking devices. These devices provide GPS tracking, and geo-fenced smart-locking capabilities to allow the discharge valves of GWC tankers to only open at designated points in our water reclamation plants.</p><p>16. Aside from illegal discharges, our sewerage system is also impacted when contractors physically damage our sewerage system such as when a piling rig punctures a sewer. Clause 42 will also enable regulations to require the installation of tracking devices on piling and soil investigation rigs. This will provide real-time alerts to PUB and contractors if their rigs are near our sewerage system, so that preventive actions can be taken where necessary. Clause 43 enacts a related amendment to the Public Utilities Act 2001 for large water supply pipelines.</p><p>17. Prior to introducing these measures, PUB engaged the industry to seek their feedback. GWCs welcomed the change as they could at the same time use the GPS devices for fleet management. Contractors were also supportive as the GPS devices would help them avoid damaging the sewers during works, which could result in much higher costs and delays.</p><p>18. Since April 2023, the industry has already implemented these requirements. All GWC tankers registered with PUB have installed GPS devices. Tracking devices have also been installed on piling and soil investigation rigs deployed to projects in the DTSS or trunk sewer protection corridor. Hence, the amendments seek to regularise these requirements.</p><p>19. With recent improvements in technology, contractors now have more advanced methods such as probing with plastic drill bits and sonar detection to identify buried services including sewers before carrying out activities such as excavation or drilling works. The industry often prefers these advanced methods as they are less intrusive and more efficient than physically digging a trial trench. Clause 9 thus provides for PUB's acceptance of such alternative methods.</p><p>2.2 Take stronger actions against illegal discharges</p><p>2.2.1 Current approach towards illegal discharges</p><p>20. Today, we have a suite of end-to-end measures to deter illegal discharges into the sewerage system. Upstream, we have a thorough vetting process before granting approvals for discharge. Our officers conduct regular inspections and monitoring throughout the network. When illegal discharges are detected, we may issue stop work orders, revoke approvals for trade effluent discharge, and impose penalties on offenders. We also communicate regularly with companies that discharge trade effluent to remind them of the important role that they play in protecting our sewers.</p><p>21. Thus far, most companies have acted responsibly. But there are some irresponsible offenders, including some recalcitrant ones, whose actions have threatened our used water system. Illegal discharges can disrupt NEWater feedstock. Toxic and harmful discharge can kill the microorganisms used to treat used water at the WRPs. This results in the water being unfit for further treatment at NEWater factories. To rectify the impact, PUB would have to temporarily halt the NEWater production process and ramp up our other National Taps to make up for these disruptions. Illegal discharges also jeopardise the safety of the people who work hard to maintain our used water system. When companies illegally discharge high concentrations of volatile organic compounds such as benzene and toluene, workers that maintain our sewers and operate our water reclamation plants may breathe in the toxic fumes. These highly flammable compounds also create fire and explosion risks. Even as PUB takes all necessary measures to ensure the safety of its workers, we should seek to eliminate such hazards in the first place. PUB also has to expend resources to investigate and carry out extensive sampling to identify the source of the illegal discharge and take remedial actions. This is costly, and time-consuming.</p><p>2.2.2 Principles used to guide the formulation of the tightened penalties</p><p>22. To enhance deterrence, we have reviewed the penalties under the SDA and propose to enhance these to ensure the penalty regime remains effective. We will implement changes in two areas - raise maximum penalties and introduce mandatory minimum penalties. In our review, we considered three objectives: First, penalties should better reflect the severe impact to our water supply. Irresponsible actions can cause disruptions to the NEWater production process. They can also endanger workers operating and maintaining our used water sewerage system and working at our WRPs.Therefore, the penalties should better reflect the gravity of such irresponsible actions. This is done both by raising the maximum penalty and introducing minimum penalties. Second, the penalty quanta should be substantial enough so that companies are not incentivised to flout the law instead of taking the necessary measures. Third, the penalty quanta should be generally aligned with those of similar offences in other Acts. For example, we aligned the maximum penalties in the SDA with that of similar offences in the Environmental Protection and Management Act 1999. In setting the minimum penalty quanta, we also considered that several Acts had mandatory minimum penalties of about 20% of the maximum penalty.</p><p>2.2.3 Raising maximum penalties</p><p>23. The first enhancement is to raise maximum penalties. Clause 12 of the Bill will amend Section 16(5) to increase the maximum penalty from $20,000 to $50,000 for repeat offenders who discharge trade effluent without approval or not in accordance with conditions of that approval or regulations. Clause 13 will amend Section 16A(6) relating to the discharge of dangerous or hazardous substances without approval or not in accordance with conditions of that approval or regulations, which causes injury, death, damage to sewers, or severe disruption to treatment, by doubling the maximum penalty for repeat offences. The maximum penalty for repeat offences will be raised from $200,000 to $400,000. Clause 14 will amend Section 17(4) to increase the maximum penalty from $40,000 to $100,000 for offences relating to the failure to comply with PUB's order to stop and/or treat the discharge of hazardous substances. Clause 42 will amend Section 74(2) to double the maximum penalty from $15,000 to $30,000 for repeat offences under regulations.</p><p>24. Penalties for sewerage offences, such as carrying out unauthorised sewerage works, will also be raised to match corresponding increases in penalties for drainage offences. These actions impact the conveyance capacity of our sewers and may result in leaks or even sewer overflows, which pose public health and environmental pollution risks. Clause 7 will amend Section 11(4) to increase the maximum first-offence penalties for the alteration of sewerage system without approval, from $20,000 to $50,000. Maximum penalties for repeat offenders will be increased from $20,000 to $100,000. Clause 10 will amend Section 14(4) to increase maximum first-offence penalties for carrying out works affecting or likely to affect the sewer or sewerage system without approval, from $20,000 to $50,000. Maximum penalties for repeat offenders will be increased from $20,000 to $100,000. Clause 17 will amend Section 20(1) to increase the maximum first offence penalties for the damage caused to a public sewerage system, from $40,000 to $50,000. Maximum penalties for repeat offenders will be increased from $40,000 to $100,000. Clause 17 will also amend Section 20(2) relating to damage caused to the public sewerage system, increasing the penalty for repeat offences from $200,000 to $400,000.</p><p>2.2.4 Introducing mandatory minimum penalties</p><p>25. The second enhancement is to introduce minimum penalties for four offences relating to illegal trade effluent discharge, across both first and subsequent offences. Clause 12 will amend Section 16(5) to insert a mandatory minimum penalty for discharging trade effluent without approval or not in accordance with conditions of that approval or regulations. This will be $4,000 for the first offence, and $10,000 for repeat offences. Clause 13 will amend Section 16A(5) to insert a mandatory minimum penalty for discharging dangerous or hazardous substances into any public sewerage system without PUB's approval or not in accordance with the conditions of that approval or regulations. Mandatory minimum penalties will be set at $10,000 for the first offence, and $20,000 for the second offence. Clause 13 will amend Section 16A(6) to insert a minimum penalty for discharging dangerous or hazardous substances without approval or not in accordance with the conditions of that approval or regulations, which causes injury, death, damage to sewers or disruption to treatment. This will be set at $40,000 for the first offence, and $80,000 for repeat offences. Clause 14 will amend Section 17(4) to insert a minimum penalty for failing to comply with an order to stop and treat discharge of hazardous substances into the public sewerage system. This will be set at $20,000.</p><p>26. There are other offences in legislation with minimum penalties, such as the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act 1990, which has a minimum penalty for the discharge of oil or oily mixture from ships.</p><p>27. While the intent of the amendments to the penalty regime is to increase deterrence, we recognise that this measure cannot work in isolation. PUB will continue to work closely with companies, including through engagement sessions to share best practices, to ensure that their trade effluent is managed and discharged responsibly.</p><p>ENHANCING FLOOD RESILIENCE</p><p>28. Next, let me move on to the amendments intended to enhance flood resilience.</p><p>29. In Singapore, we adopt a holistic \"Source-Pathway-Receptor\" approach to manage stormwater. At source, we try to slow down surface runoff at developments to reduce peak flow into public drains. At locations where stormwater runoff is generated, we require new developments of more than 0.2 hectares to implement solutions. Solutions could include detention tanks or nature-based solutions to slow down stormwater runoff entering the public drainage system. Along the pathways, or the routes through which stormwater is conveyed, PUB designs drains and canals to convey stormwater efficiently. To enhance our pathways, we raised design standards for drains in 2011 to cater for more intense rainfall events. We also implemented important drainage improvement projects like the Stamford Diversion Canal for this purpose. Finally, at the \"receptors\" where floodwaters may propagate to and affect infrastructure, receptor solutions provide additional flood protection for buildings and key infrastructure. For example, MRT station entrances are required to be elevated above ground level with a minimum crest level to prevent stormwater from entering the MRT stations.</p><p>30. The stormwater drainage is one continuous system - actions affecting one part of the system can have severe impact elsewhere in the system. To provide an example, in 2021, there was a construction firm that was doing road-widening works. In the process, they blocked off a roadside drain and diverted the flow to a new drain section that was still under construction. They did so without PUB's approval, and this irresponsible action eventually led to a flood. Traffic came to a standstill for about 2 hours, 13 vehicles were partially submerged, and 1 person was taken to hospital.</p><p>31. The proposed amendments will introduce measures across the system to improve stormwater management.</p><p>3.1 Protecting the stormwater drainage system from silty discharges and obstruction</p><p>32. The capacity and function of drains and reservoirs can be compromised due to unauthorised modifications, or obstructions caused by debris and silt. This can cause stormwater to back up and flood surrounding developments. We will raise penalties to deter damage or unauthorised modifications to the stormwater drainage system. Clauses 21 and 22 amend Sections 23(4) and 24(4) respectively to increase the maximum first-offence penalties for the alteration of stormwater drainage system without approval and interfering with drains that cause flow obstructions respectively, from $20,000 to $50,000. Maximum penalties for repeat offenders will be increased from $20,000 to $100,000. We aligned the penalty quantum to that of Section 26 which relates to works affecting the stormwater drainage system. Clause 23 amends Section 26(5) to double the maximum penalty for repeat offenders who carry out works or activities which could affect any stormwater drainage system or lead to the discharge of silt directly or indirectly into any stormwater drainage system from $50,000 to $100,000. Clause 24 amends Section 30(2) to increase the maximum penalty for first offences for causing damage to the stormwater drainage system from $40,000 to $50,000 and raises the maximum penalty for repeat offenders from $40,000 to $100,000.</p><p>33. We want to be comprehensive and consistent in our coverage of activities that may affect the stormwater drainage system. Currently, the SDA only regulates construction activities that affect the stormwater drainage system and non-construction activities in State Land drainage reserves. Clause 22 expands the SDA to also prohibit non-construction activities that cause obstruction to all drains, including those outside of State Land drainage reserves.</p><p>34. PUB has silt control powers for the discharge of surface water containing silt from construction activities into the stormwater drainage system. However, non-construction activities such as sand stockpiles for landscaping works also have the potential to cause silty discharge. For example, we have seen a case of a contractor improperly storing material like soil and sand near Punggol Reservoir, resulting in silt being washed into the reservoir during rain. Clause 23 amends Section 26 to extend PUB's silt control powers to non-construction activities and discharges into reservoirs.</p><p>3.2 Keeping stormwater drainage systems and flood protection measures in proper order</p><p>35. Managing flood risks is a collective effort. With more intense weather events, it is not feasible to expand our drains to cater for every extreme rainfall event. Premises owners and occupiers have a part to play in ensuring the flood resilience of their own premises, which also affects the surrounding developments and connected drainage system. Clause 20 will introduce new Sections 22A and 22B to require owners of premises to keep their stormwater drainage systems, drains, and flood protection measures in proper order. Clause 42 amends Section 74 to enable regulations to be prescribed towards these requirements in relation to flood protection measures. For example, requiring minimum platform levels at new developments and redevelopments, and requiring crest levels for all entrances, exits or openings to basements or underground structures like tunnels and underground MRT stations.</p><p>AMENDMENTS RELATED TO PUB'S OPERATIONS</p><p>36. Finally, a third group of amendments are technical in nature and relate to PUB's operations to safeguard the sustainability of our water supply. It has been 12 years since the last Sewerage and Drainage (Amendment) Bill was passed. These amendments update the SDA provisions so that they stay relevant and effective in supporting PUB's operations in today's context.</p><p>4.1 Supporting PUB's Operations</p><p>37. When there are any illegal alterations, works or damage that affect the public sewerage system, stormwater drainage system, or drain, clauses 7, 10, 17, and 21 to 24 provide for PUB to urgently step in to carry out rectification works to restore the function of the public sewerage system, stormwater drainage system, or drain, and recover the cost of the rectification works from the culprit. Currently, PUB is unable to recover the costs if it steps in to carry out rectification works, even when it is clear that the damage was caused by the responsible party. PUB can only recover costs if the party responsible for the damage had first defaulted on PUB's written notice to perform rectification works.</p><p>38. Clause 33 amends Section 43 to ensure that PUB officers have powers of entry to deal with emergency situations involving public sewerage systems and stormwater drainage systems, such as chokes or pipes that had developed structural defects over time, so that PUB can undertake urgent rectification work necessary for the service or safety of the public. This amendment mirrors existing powers of entry in emergency situations in the Public Utilities Act 2001. Emergency situations are those that involve damage or obstruction to a public sewerage system or stormwater drainage system where PUB assesses that rectification work is necessary for the service or safety of the public.</p><p>39. Clause 34 amends Section 44A to allow officers to take videos in addition to photographs, and require the production of video surveillance footage, during investigations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of investigations.</p><p>40. Works to sewerage and drainage systems must be completed in accordance with plans approved by PUB, to protect public safety. To ensure this, Clause 27 amends Section 33 to enable PUB to issue a written notice requiring developments to apply for a Compliance Certificate which will complete the works certification process and penalise those that fail to comply with the written notice. Clause 29 will amend Section 36 to clarify who are the owners or occupiers of premises who may be directed to carry out rectification works. This is aligned with the existing provisions for sewerage matters.</p><p>4.2 Regularising PUB's Existing Practices and Other Amendments</p><p>41. I spoke earlier about protecting our sewerage system. Clauses 9 and 10 will amend Sections 13A and 14 respectively to regularise our existing practice of protecting sewers under construction and constructed sewers that have not yet been commissioned. The Clauses will require companies to ascertain locations of such sewers to prevent damage to them. Clause 42 amends Section 74 to empower regulations to be made for the issue of stop work orders so as to stop the discharge of trade effluent, when needed to protect the public sewerage system.</p><p>42. When taking over public drains or sewers constructed by other agencies and developers, PUB needs to impose a Defects Liability Period, or DLP. Clause 27 amends Section 33 to formally allow PUB to impose the DLP and to provide PUB with recourse should defects arise during the DLP or any warranty against defects is not assigned to PUB.</p><p>43. Clause 41 inserts a new Section 73A which allows PUB to issue administrative exemptions from legislated requirements on a case-by-case basis, in instances where stakeholders face specific compliance constraints. For example, new developments with a small footprint might not be able to meet PUB's Minimum Platform Level requirement as this could lead to additional amenities such as ramps required for barrier-free access. In such cases, PUB may allow the installation of flood protection systems like flood barriers to give the same level of flood protection.</p><p>44. Clause 40 amends Section 70 to provide for composition sums collected by PUB under the SDA to be paid into the Consolidated Fund.</p><p>45. Clause 38 inserts a new Section 60A to make it clear that certain drainage and sewerage systems built on private land do not form part of the land and do not belong to the landowner.</p><p>46. We are standardising and clarifying terms used in the SDA, both through Clause 2 which clarifies terms such as \"sewerage system\" defined in Section 2, and through other Clauses which remove overlaps in the use of the terms \"sewage\" and \"trade effluent\" throughout the Act.</p><p>47. Clause 26 inserts a new Section 32A to enable the incorporation by reference of PUB's Codes of Practice for both sewerage and drainage to enable PUB to enforce the requirements more effectively.</p><p>48. And finally, Clause 35 amends Section 47 to remove the right of appeal to the Minister in relation to three provisions, where there is already recourse to the Courts.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>49. In summary, we must protect our sewers from damage and take errant companies to task to better secure our used water system. This will safeguard our weather-resilient NEWater tap. We must also protect our stormwater system to enhance flood resilience. This will prepare us to adapt to extreme weather patterns that will come with climate change.</p><p>50. The proposed amendments to the SDA I have elaborated on will provide PUB with the legislative powers to do so, and I invite premise owners, developers and stakeholders to work with us and play a part in securing our water future together.</p><p>51. The proposed amendments related to PUB's operations will allow PUB to be more effective in fulfilling its mission to tame stormwater, reclaim used water, and ensure a safe and reliable supply of water for all.</p><p>52.

I am glad to join you for the 7th Annual Global Research Alliance for Sustainable Finance and Investment conference, or GRASFI, at the Singapore Management University or SMU.</p><p>Fostering Credible Transition, Creating Sustainable Impact<br/><br/>Climate change is a clear and present danger for the world. This is the first time that GRASFI is gathering physically here in Asia. I hope this experience will be valuable to deepen your understanding of Asia. Asia is a big and complex region, with countries at different stages of development, and with a range of economic and social needs and resources.</p><p>On one hand, we emit about half of global emissions. These emissions are expected to grow, driven by economic and development needs, including extending electricity to rural populations.</p><p>On the other hand, Asia is rich in biodiversity, which is affected by climate change, but also offers a promising range of nature-based solutions. Asia is home to around a fifth of the world's rainforests. The waters in South-East Asia, near Singapore, harbour one of the world's most extensive seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves.</p><p>The theme of the conference \"Fostering Credible Transition, Creating Sustainable Impact\" is most apt. With the right policies, strategies, and technologies, we can pursue sustainable growth for the benefit of people and planet.</p><p>While climate change affects all states around the world, for tropical island states like Singapore, it is an existential risk.</p><p>Small island states are the first to experience the impact of climate change.</p><p>Singapore's latest National Climate Change Study projects that mean sea levels in Singapore could rise by up to 2 metres by 2150.</p><p>But climate change will set off other complex changes in the world's ecology, that ultimately impacts all of us, wherever you live.</p><p>These include tipping points in our ice sheets, seawater and forests, which could amplify and accelerate climate change.</p><p>It is critical that we address this existential challenge and avoid the tragedy of the commons. Every one of us has a stake, and everyone must do his or her part. This complex problem with multiple dimensions must be dealt with at multiple levels, with a range of policy instruments, and by mobilising a wide range of stakeholders.</p><p>At the global level, we need to forge a consensus for a sustainable and equitable model of growth.</p><p>International frameworks and agreements are the foundation of this, with the UNFCCC process and the Paris Agreement at the heart of it.</p><p>Singapore is a strong supporter of this multilateral approach, including serving as ministerial facilitators in the negotiations leading up to the Paris Agreement, and more recently on mitigation and carbon credits.</p><p>Global institutions, such as the World Bank and IMF, play important roles in mobilising climate finance. I am glad that the World Bank Group has a presence in Singapore, including an Infrastructure and Urban Hub to serve the region.</p><p>At the country level, we must do our parts to decarbonise our economies, and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>We can all contribute in our own way, regardless of our size, or our level of development. For instance, even though Singapore emits less than 0.1% of global emissions, we have set ourselves a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and a little earlier for the public sector.</p><p>To achieve this, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 - a roadmap to mobilise our industries and citizens towards sustainable growth.</p><p>When I was the Finance Minister, I introduced a carbon tax as a price signal for carbon emissions. The government has also issued green bonds We have since laid out a schedule of carbon tax levels until 2030.</p><p>The proceeds from our carbon tax will be used to help companies in Singapore decarbonise.</p><p>And under our S$28 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan, we are supporting R&amp;D into new climate technologies and solutions like sustainable building materials, carbon capture and storage, and alternative fuels like biofuels and hydrogen.</p><p>Do find out more about these projects from GRASFI participants from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and SMU, which have strong science and technology capabilities, and research programmes in several areas of sustainability.</p><p>We trust that these initiatives can enable us to boost resilience here in Singapore, and enable us to serve the region as a pathfinder and testbed for green solutions.</p><p>And at the industry level, companies will need to keep pace with greater consumer preferences for sustainable products, and emerging climate regulations like sustainability reporting and cross-border carbon taxes.</p><p>Companies can either pivot their business models and portfolios to contribute and benefit from new opportunities, or risk being disrupted by others or boycotted by consumers.</p><p>Last week, I presented an award for transformation to Sembcorp Industries, a local energy company which had pivoted from oil and gas to renewable energy. They had also achieved impressive total shareholder returns through this transformation.</p><p>As part of our wider efforts in Singapore to transform our economy - also known as Industry Transformation 2.0 - we have added two new pillars to the existing four pillars, by including sustainability and resilience.</p><p>Sustainable Finance as a Catalyst for a Greener and More Resilient Future<br/><br/>Among the many stakeholders, the financial sector plays a critical role. Significant financing is needed to accomplish these ambitions at the global, country, and industry levels. We must mobilise financial resources and allocate these effectively to meet the diverse needs.</p><p>McKinsey estimates that Asia alone needs more than US$3 trillion annually to achieve net-zero by 2050.</p><p>But public finances in many countries are stressed, especially after the COVID-19 pandemics.</p><p>To meet the needs for investment and capital, we will need to more effectively mobilise some of the estimated US$400 trillion of private capital.</p><p>Sustainable finance - the pursuit of financial returns alongside environmental and social objectives - will be a critical enabler.</p><p>As a global financial centre, Singapore hopes to play our role in advancing sustainable finance, for our region and the world.</p><p>Last year, we launched the Finance for Net Zero Action Plan, which seeks to achieve four strategic outcomes.</p><p>One, to promote consistent, comparable and reliable climate data and disclosures to guide decision making and safeguard against climate risks; Two, to build up a climate resilient financial sector with deep capabilities in risk management practices like climate scenario analysis and stress testing; Three, to support financial institutions in developing credible science-based transition plans; and Four, to promote innovative financing solutions such as blended finance and voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>Many of you here are experts and practitioners in sustainable finance. You have an impressive list of topics and speakers for the coming sessions. Let me take this opportunity to suggest three areas where academics, industry, and government can work together to advance sustainable finance.</p><p>The first area is to develop better definitions and outcome measures of sustainable finance. This reduces the risks of green washing, and helps guide companies and investors in decision-making.</p><p>Taxonomies which define sustainable activities, are the foundation of this.</p><p>I am glad that efforts are underway to align these taxonomies across jurisdictions, including between Singapore, China and the EU. This will facilitate cross-border transactions by financial institutions in these jurisdictions.</p><p>We can also work together to improve how we measure the impact of finance on sustainability.</p><p>For example, the conference paper by Ayako Yasuda and Keer Yang from UC Davis suggests that clearer labelling of sustainable finance products helps investors make better investment decisions.</p><p>Similarly, the Singapore Green Finance Institute (SGFIN) developed a corporate impact pricing model that leverages AI to analyse the impact of environmental performance on stock prices.</p><p>And the Singapore Green Finance Centre is developing an Impact Weighted Account Framework to help companies better assess the sustainability impact of their operations and investments.</p><p>These initiatives help us measure outcomes, and to channel capital into activities that are impactful.</p><p>Second, to shape regulations to facilitate sustainable finance flows, while keeping down regulatory costs to companies.</p><p>For example, we have seen an increase in sustainability disclosure regulations in many jurisdictions, with some countries looking to progressively implement the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosure standards including listed companies in Singapore from FY2025, and large non-listed companies from FY2027.</p><p>By working together, we could better develop reporting frameworks that are simple yet effective.</p><p>I am glad that the conference will examine the impact of regulation, and on ESG ratings and disclosures, over the next few days.</p><p>Good regulations can also catalyse the flow of financing to impactful causes such as energy infrastructure, and deep tech innovations to accelerate decarbonisation.</p><p>For example, in the Handbook on Scaling Up Blended Finance by the Network for Greening the Financial System, regulatory and practical barriers were often cited as obstacles to scaling up blended finance transactions in emerging markets.</p><p>Third, while definitions, outcome measures, and regulations are important, ultimately, any system is operated by people. We must therefore uplift our skills and broaden our talent base.</p><p>As part of Singapore's Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map, we will invest $35 million over the next three years to upskill and reskill our finance professionals.</p><p>This includes expanding the range of sustainable finance training courses for working professionals, undergraduate and polytechnic students.</p><p>I encourage all of us here to develop new teaching modalities to make sustainable finance more accessible. For example, SGFC leveraged SMU's teaching infrastructure to deliver executive courses, and provide a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that is open to the public.</p><p>While we do our best with our current state of knowledge, we need to recognise that sustainability, and sustainable finance is a complex and fast-evolving field. So we must continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge, and deepen the capabilities of our industry.</p><p>This will require us to bring together multidisciplinary research and real-life application, and bridge the varied fields of science, technology, economics and finance.</p><p>Academic institutions, including Centres of Excellence like the SGFC and SGFIN, can play an important role by bringing academics and industry together to study important issues such as carbon markets, climate adaptation, transition finance, and nature. Our Centres of Excellence are also crucial in ensuring that the research uncovered can be applied by industry through practice notes and whitepapers, and through training courses across the career spectrum - from undergraduate to executive and C-suite levels.</p><p>Through research networks like GRASFI, we can bring together the best minds around the world, to explore, to learn and to share.</p><p>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me conclude. Climate change is an existential challenge, and one of the most complex challenges facing humankind.</p><p>Every one of us must do his or her part, and make adjustments at the global, country, industry and personal levels.</p><p>Academic researchers and practitioners like yourselves can help guide global efforts for decarbonisation and sustainable growth in an objective and science-based manner.</p><p>We will need to push the frontiers of innovation across different fields -in science and technology to better understand climate science and to develop new solutions; as well as in economics and finance to optimise price signals and fiscal incentives; and in the social sciences to shape norms and nudge behaviours.</p><p>By bringing together experts from all over the world, GRASFI is an important platform to exchange perspectives and learn from each other's experiences.</p><p>I wish you a successful conference, and continued collaborations in this complex and critical work.

I am delighted to be here at the Global-Asia Family Office Summit. Earlier this year, I joined the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as a board member, and I have enjoyed meeting with management and professionals running our financial industry, ranging from banks to asset managers, insurers and capital market entities. Today, I look forward to speaking with the community of family offices in Singapore.</p><p>Continued growth in wealth management sector</p><p>2. The family office community in Singapore is a vibrant and growing space. From just 400 single family offices awarded MAS tax incentives as at 2020, it grew 3.5 times to 1,400 at the end of last year. In the first 8 months this year, we added another 250 to reach 1,650 single family offices. Growth has continued to be robust, and we expect the number of new single family offices for 2024 to surpass the 300 that we added in 2023.</p><p>3. To those who have recently chosen to set up your family office here, a warm welcome to Singapore. You have joined us at a good time - Asia's prospects ahead are bright and the growth momentum remains strong. The Asia Pacific region is expected to grow by 4.9% in 2025, faster than any other part of the world. And Singapore as a hub in Asia will benefit from this positive development, growing together with our region.</p><p>4. As a strategic gateway to Asia, Singapore remains a trusted financial centre and well-regarded destination for asset and wealth management. Growth in assets under management, or AUM, last year was driven by increase in valuation and net inflows across traditional and alternative assets, as well as in wealth management and many other activities. The wealth management AUM recorded a growth of more than 8% in 2023, continuing the trend of growth in the past few years. And overall, the 5-year compounded annual growth rate of wealth management AUM came up to about 10%.</p><p>5. Wealth owners choose Singapore for many reasons - our strong rule of law, robust and predictable regulatory regime and a comprehensive ecosystem of wealth managers and professional service providers are also some of the reasons. Equally important to wealth owners who spend time here is our high quality of life, our safe and secure environment which is family-friendly, and our excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, as well as our world-class education and healthcare systems.</p><p>6. Local banks like the Bank of Singapore and UOB, as well as global private banks such as Citi, HSBC and Nomura, have announced their plans to continue expanding their teams and offerings in Singapore. A survey conducted by MAS with a group of leading private banks in Singapore earlier this year found that client assets in the first quarter of 2024 grew by 9.5% compared to the same quarter one year ago. And this was echoed by BCG's Global Wealth Report which projected that Singapore would grow by 8.5% per annum between 2023 to 2028, faster than any other global wealth centres.</p><p>7. Singapore's high standards of regulation foster a reputable environment for genuine investments and wealth management activities to flourish and bloom. And this is our strength and our branding. We will continue to provide a trusted and stable environment, giving investors assurance and confidence - in Chinese, what people would say \"Trustworthy, reliable, and safe\" as a sense of assurance. We need to strike the right balance between having robust regulation and growth, and continue to be the key to success of our wealth management sector. We do not want to dilute our focus on providing this safe, trusted environment, which will require robust regulations. But robust regulations and proper safeguards can go hand in hand with an environment that is also business-friendly - and that is what we want to achieve.</p><p>8. I would like to reassure our industry stakeholders that Singapore will continue to welcome legitimate wealth, genuine investments and complementary international talent from around the world. And the more turbulent and disruptive the external environment becomes, the more we must remain open, welcoming, stable and secure to differentiate ourselves.</p><p>9. MAS will continue to focus on providing a conducive environment for wealth owners and family offices. For example, in response to industry feedback, MAS recently provided guidance to financial institutions on how they can implement risk-proportionate due diligence checks on the source of wealth of their customers to avoid undue delays in bank account opening timeliness. MAS has also streamlined the tax incentive application process, to reduce the waiting time for family office funds. We will work together with our industry partners to improve our processes to make them simpler, better and faster.</p><p>Impact created for Singapore</p><p>10. The family office ecosystem has added diversity to our financial sector and created value for Singapore's economy and society. I would like to acknowledge and express my appreciation to the family office community for your contributions to Singapore.</p><p>* Family offices have created good jobs in Singapore, both directly, when you hire your investment professionals locally, and indirectly, when you engage the services provided by our private banks, fund managers, as well as legal and tax firms.</p><p>*The patient capital that families bring, along with your business know-how and networks, can greatly contribute to nurturing our local ventures and innovation activities. Take for example, Tres Group, whose S$20 million investments spurred the growth of GetGo, the largest carsharing platform in Singapore, with the mission to promote sustainable mobility.</p><p>* Family-led enterprises have also been key contributors to climate mitigation and adaptation causes. For example, the Olayan Group donated towards the Asia Climate Solutions Design Grant launched by MAS in partnership with Convergence. The grant defrays the cost of early-stage preparation and design of innovative blended finance solutions. The grant has supported projects coming from clean energy transition to nature-based solutions, catalysing a pipeline of investible projects that would otherwise be under-capitalised.</p><p>Conducive and rich ecosystem of service offerings</p><p>11.There is further potential for family offices to grow and contribute. To achieve this, we must strengthen the value proposition of our family office ecosystem, through three key areas:</p><p>* First, families' interest in philanthropy and doing good by giving back to help others in society.</p><p>*Second, families' interest in investing as private equity or venture capital.</p><p>*And third, to build talent and capabilities in the family office space.</p><p>I'll touch on each one briefly.</p><p>12. Starting off with philanthropy. Many family offices are already keenly aware of the important role they can play in contributing to the broader community and helping the less fortunate. Indeed, we are seeing growing interest from family offices to become a \"force for good\" - so not just to do well, but also to do good -and establish a legacy that extends beyond financial gains and wealth accumulation.</p><p>13. For example,</p><p>* The Ishk Tolaram Foundation supports education and skills training for dyslexic pre-schoolers and autistic talent to pursue engineering careers.</p><p>* The Tsao Foundation contributed significantly to eldercare solutions in the community and brings together stakeholders to implement programmes and policy research on effective ageing.</p><p>14. Yet many families are often faced with questions like how to give, and what organisation to give to? Like a trekker looking upwards towards Mount Everest, wondering how to take your first step that will pave your way to reach the summit. This is why Singapore is developing a range of initiatives to support your philanthropy and impact journey.</p><p>* This includes mountain guides to support you on your climb. We have been systematically deepening the pool of professionals in Singapore with expertise in philanthropic advisory and impact capital.</p><p>* In 2021, MAS and the Institute of Banking &amp; Finance launched the Philanthropy Advisory Technical Skills and Competencies to provide guidance on the skills and competencies that professionals should possess to support the philanthropic aspirations of high-net-worth individuals and families. This served as a resource for training providers in the design of relevant training curriculum.</p><p>* We then set up a dedicated Centre for Sustainable Finance and Private Wealth in 2022, founded by the University of Zurich, to equip finance professionals in Singapore with the knowledge to drive sustainable investment strategies for their clients in Asia. More than 800 professionals have participated in training courses since its inception, acquiring valuable skills in sustainable finance, impact investing and mobilising private capital for sustainable development.</p><p>*The Wealth Management Institute has also seen significant enrolments in sustainable finance courses: in the last 2 years, it saw more than 2,000 enrolments into sustainable finance courses.</p><p>*And earlier this year, the Asia Centre for Changemakers, hosted under the WMI, launched the Certified Impact Philanthropy Professional, Asia's first-ever dedicated certification mapped to industry skillsets for philanthropy advisors.</p><p>* Now, besides mountain guides to help family offices who want to scale to the summit, we also want to provide you with climbing mates who share your passion and who can climb the mountain together with you. We are growing a community with the \"Impact Philanthropy Partnership\" that is led by WMI and the Private Banking Industry Group, where families can share on their philanthropic experiences and build a network of like-minded peers. There is no need to climb the summit on your own. You will have mountain guides to help you, and you will have climbing mates to make your journey together.</p><p>* And of course, you must also have good climbing gear and we are catalysing the growth of tools and structures, such as Donor Advised Funds, and deal-share, due diligence and impact monitoring platforms to make it easier to give by handling the administrative work and research.</p><p>* And finally, to provide a conducive climate for your climb. We have introduced tax policies to encourage donations both locally and overseas. Singapore has been granting 250% tax deductions on donations to local Institutions of Public Character for more than a decade. For overseas donations, we have seen growing interest from family offices in the Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme launched at the start of this year to provide qualifying donors with a 100% tax deduction.</p><p>15. Philanthropy is a long journey, but we believe that with skilled mountain guides, like-minded companionship, good climbing gear, and a conducive climate, you will be successful in your philanthropic ascent. And I hope that you will tap on these resources and be a part of our journey as we develop Singapore into a global centre for philanthropy.</p><p>16. Beyond philanthropy, we also want to give wealth owners the best opportunities in preserving and growing your wealth. As I mentioned earlier, we need to do well so that we can continue to do good. To achieve this, Singapore is home to more than 300 private equity and venture capital fund managers, many who are keen to partner family offices like yourselves on co-investment opportunities.</p><p>* MAS has been working closely with the industry to develop Singapore's private markets over the last few years. We enhanced the operating environment for VC investments through calibration of our regulatory framework for VC managers. Singapore currently has four private market platforms that are established in Singapore, such as ADDX and Capbridge, and we are working to anchor more of such players here.</p><p>* And to further strengthen linkages between family offices and the local investment and innovation ecosystem, the Economic Development Board and MAS will continue to work closely with Enterprise Singapore and SGInnovate, and we have set up several platforms to connect local companies to potential investors like family offices. This is another area which you can deploy your wealth, which is to help grow the start-up ecosystem. And hopefully, you can also get good investment returns.</p><p>Skills development for the industry</p><p>17. And finally, we believe that good talent is the bedrock of a successful family office ecosystem. I am pleased that WMI is supporting the development and upskilling of Singapore's family office-related workforce. With over 5,000 enrolments since 2020, feedback of the programmes have been positive and have provided valuable networking opportunities for learners with educators and other industry professionals.</p><p>18. Now importantly, WMI is not resting on its laurels. Earlier this morning, WMI announced that they will be embarking on two new flagship programmes - the Changemaker Impact Endeavour Fellowship Programme to support Asia's philanthropists bringing about effective change and impact, and a new Dalio Investment Principles programme to build stronger portfolio management capabilities among family offices principals and investment teams. Two good new initiatives.</p><p>19. These programmes will complement WMI's existing suite of training programmes for family office principals and professionals, and take our family office ecosystem to greater heights. I want to thank Ms Foo Mee Har and her team at WMI for their good job and for playing this important role to grow the wealth management sector from strength to strength.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>20. Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude the speech by reiterating that Singapore will continue to enhance our ecosystem of service offerings, underpinned by trust, strong regulation and supportive government policies. This is a place that you can put your money for investments for the long-term and be assured of the stability and trust here. My colleagues and I are confident that the sector has much potential to grow further in the years ahead, and we want to work together with all of you to contribute more opportunities for Singapore and create more good jobs for Singaporeans. We also want to help you, in the process of investing here and setting up your family office, to do well and do good, to achieve the impact and legacy that you want for your families.</p><p>21. Thank you for being here today, and I hope that the Summit will bring you insightful learnings, foster meaningful connections, and facilitate greater positive impact for Singapore and the region. Thank you very much.</p><p>[Category: Banks, Asset Management/ Mutual Funds, Financial/ Capital Market, Events]</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["For example, the Olayan Group donated towards the Asia Climate Solutions Design Grant launched by MAS in partnership with Convergence.

Congratulations to CDL on the opening of the Singapore Sustainability Academy Annex (SSA Annex) today.<br/><br/>I see many familiar faces here from recent events like Go Green SG and the Youth4Climate challenge.<br/><br/>The growing tempo of events is a good sign that the sustainability movement here, and around the world is picking up momentum. Today's launch is another occasion for us to gather and exchange ideas.<br/><br/>Taking Action to Address Climate Change<br/><br/>Sustainable development, especially tackling climate change, is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.<br/><br/>It is encouraging that commendable strides have been made, especially since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.<br/><br/>Improvements in technology have reduced the production costs of renewable energy significantly.<br/><br/>Various industry sectors, including building owners and real estate developers, are developing plans to decarbonise their sectors.<br/><br/>Many financial institutions and investors have also adopted sustainability targets and Net-Zero transition plans.<br/><br/>There are also many efforts to look at nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>But we need to do more and act faster.<br/><br/>According to the latest IPCC report, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels.<br/><br/>This is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 Celsius, and to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>But global emissions last year continued to rise above 2022 levels.</p><p>So we are moving in the wrong direction, including in Asia, which accounts for about half of global emissions.<br/><br/>Globally and in the region, we are seeing the results of climate change, with extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and storms.<br/><br/>Singapore is very vulnerable to climate change. Temperatures have risen steadily over the past 40 years, and rising sea levels pose existential risks for our island nation.<br/><br/>It is important that we prepare ourselves for climate change early - starting with our goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>We have put in place policies such as a carbon tax and mandatory sustainability reporting. These are not always easy for companies to adopt, and we will need to help our companies adjust.<br/><br/>We have also launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, as a national roadmap to guide sustainable development.<br/><br/>And just a few days earlier, the National Research Foundation, or NRF, launched the new CREATE Thematic Programme in Decarbonisation to help decarbonise the energy and industry sectors together with international research partners.<br/><br/>These plans and policies aim to help Singapore increase our resilience to climate change, and contribute to global efforts.<br/><br/>We hope to be a pathfinder and testbed for green solutions, and catalyse a sustainability wave in the region and beyond.<br/><br/>Partnerships to Accomplish our Sustainability Agenda<br/><br/>The agenda that I have laid out is ambitious and will require all of us to play our part.<br/><br/>As Sherman spoke earlier, CDL is leading by example to make sustainability an important pillar of your business ethos and strategy.<br/><br/>2030 and 2050 net zero targets guide your operations towards greater sustainability, and you have contributed to shaping industry practices in emerging areas such as sustainability reporting and sustainable finance.<br/><br/>CDL has also played an active role in sustainability education, and I was happy to join your initiatives like the CDL Green Gallery at the Botanic Gardens, and the 7th edition of the Youth4Climate Festival which was held in Bedok earlier this month.<br/><br/>This spirit of active citizenry is reflected in the setting up of the SSA in 2017 as a ground-up initiative and zero-energy facility dedicated to sustainability capacity building and thought leadership.</p><p>I am glad that the SSA has hosted over 1,000 events and 35,000 visitors since its launch. Imagine if every visitor here brought three good ideas, you would have collected over 100,000 ideas. And if only half of those ideas are implemented, you will have at least 50,000 good actions that are taken.<br/><br/>So congratulations to CDL, and I hope that you will inspire more companies to follow suit.<br/><br/>While such individual ground-up efforts are important, we can make even greater progress by forging partnerships with like-minded partners.<br/><br/>The challenges of climate change are multi-faceted - from understanding climate science, to changing the behaviours and preferences of everyone.<br/><br/>To innovate and tackle these challenges, we will need to bring together the multiple perspectives of experts in a wide range of areas including science, technology, business, and social sciences.<br/><br/>The SSA fosters such partnerships by providing a convenient physical space, and curating a calendar of events, to bring these stakeholders together.<br/><br/>Onsite partners like the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS), UN Global Compact Network Singapore (GCNS), World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), CDP, GRI and Ocean Geographics add additional expertise to these engagements.<br/><br/>Today, as we inaugurate the new SSA Annex, let me highlight two areas of achievements by the SSA.<br/><br/>First, the SSA has done well to raise public awareness on sustainability and mobilise collective action, by bringing together efforts across the Public, Private and People sectors.<br/><br/>For example, the Second Public Consultation for the Good Samaritan Food Donation Bill was held at the SSA earlier this year, and MP Mr Louis Ng presented his draft bill to reduce food waste for public input.<br/><br/>Similarly, talks and workshops at the SSA have helped demystify topics such as carbon accounting and reporting, the circular economy, biodiversity, decarbonisation and climate adaptation.<br/><br/>So with an expanded SSA Annex, we can expect more of such initiatives from CDL and your partners!<br/><br/>Second, SSA has helped corporates to transform and incorporate sustainability into their business models and practices.<br/><br/>Companies often have a substantial impact on the environment across their industrial processes, supply chains, and product life cycles.<br/><br/>But not all of them have the resources or expertise to understand sustainability issues, especially our SMEs.</p><p>Many companies also struggle to navigate global environmental regulations.<br/><br/>So, while companies should naturally compete in the business field, they will also benefit by working together to pool expertise and share their experiences on challenges that everyone is facing.<br/><br/>This is the spirit behind the Industry Transformation Maps or ITMs - with sustainability being a core pillar across each of the 23 ITMs in ITM 2.0.<br/><br/>We must help our companies and workers build up a strong foundation of sustainability knowledge and skills.<br/><br/>The SSA has contributed to this over the years, by hosting talks and trainings at the SSA to build capacity among our companies on green buildings, nature conservation and the adoption of sustainable energy.<br/><br/>These are conducted with partners like the Singapore Environment Council, SEAS, the Nature Society, the World Green Building Council and the Singapore Green Building Council.<br/><br/>Similarly, under the Enterprise Sustainability Programme, Enterprise Singapore works with partners like GCNS to equip companies with skills like carbon accounting and greenhouse gas management.<br/><br/>Such training courses not only allow companies to tap on expertise from qualified trainers, but also helps them network and learn from each other.<br/><br/>In turn, these new skills position our companies and workers to better seize new opportunities in a carbon-constrained world.<br/><br/>To seize such new opportunities, our focus in Singapore must go beyond training and capacity building, to working with companies to develop, innovate and scale up climate solutions.<br/><br/>These solutions can help us achieve our targets under the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, by bringing down emissions in the buildings and real estate sector, which contribute to some 20% of Singapore's carbon emissions.<br/><br/>The Green Buildings Innovation Cluster Programme, or GBIC, has been an important platform to bring together different stakeholders to innovate and develop such solutions to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings.<br/><br/>These stakeholders include our Autonomous Universities and Research Institutions, building owners such as JTC and CDL, and building solution providers like ST Engineering and Building Systems Diagnostics (BSD).<br/><br/>Under our National Research Foundation RIE 2021-25, we are devoting $28 bil to our R&amp;D efforts. One of the four big domains in our R&amp;D efforts is on Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS). Under our USS R&amp;D programme, we have a range of interesting research that is ongoing in our universities as well as in the research institutes, including how AI and sustainability could be complementary.<br/><br/>GBIC also supports the Super Low Energy Building Smart Hub, which includes a database of technologies undergoing testing in Singapore.</p><p>I had seen some examples of these low-carbon building materials and energy-efficient designs when I visited NUS's College of Design and Engineering.<br/><br/>So I encourage everyone here to contribute to our innovation ecosystem, and be part of the solution.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me conclude.<br/><br/>We need to take urgent action to reduce global emissions, and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>We must all do our part, and work together to pool our resources and expertise, and support each other to achieve our sustainability objectives.<br/><br/>So as we inaugurate this new Annex, let us use this space to:<br/><br/>i. push the boundaries of sustainability thinking;<br/><br/>ii. work together to mobilise collective action;<br/><br/>iii. help our companies transform and embrace sustainability; and<br/><br/>iv. develop innovative solutions that can be scaled to serve the region and beyond.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Sherman and the CDL team on the launch of the Annex!

Or by voters, who do not seem to care about climate change.</p><p> The CSDS-Lokniti 2024 pre-poll survey indicates that Indian voters are primarily concerned with unemployment and inflation.</p><p> Anthropocentric world viewA detailed review of the election manifestos revealed that, except for the regional party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, none of the major political parties in India have concrete grassroots-level plans to mitigate the impact of climate change.</p><p>India's electoral scene features only a modest and oblique reflection of issues related to climate change. </p><p> In forest-adjoining areas throughout the country, it is sincreasingly common for wild animals to enter human settlements and cause damage. This is mostly caused by food and water shortages in summer, and alterations in wildlife habitats because of climate change.</p><p> In the Wayanad constituency where Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is contesting, human-wildlife conflicts have already become a hot electoral issue.</p><p> A poster on a street wall in a village on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border read: \"It is the people who vote in elections, not the animals that are encroaching into human settlements. Stop animal rule!\"</p><p> Such sentiment arises from a prevalent anthropocentric world view, where the state forest and wildlife departments are criticised for prioritising animals over human beings.</p><p> In Lok Sabha constituencies in the Western Ghats, the authors observed that environmental concerns hardly influence electoral politics, despite the fact that the daily lives of people in those regions are closely intertwined with nature.</p><p> Perhaps the best illustration of this would be the popular protests a decade ago, against the Madhav Gadgil-K Kasturirangan committee reports. These reports aimed at safeguarding the ecologically fragile Western Ghats, a 1,600 km-long mountain range from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu, by restricting human construction and certain types of agriculture.</p><p> The inhabitants of the Western Ghats, which is identified as one of the world's eight \"hottest hotspots\" of biological diversity, managed to win a Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 election with the support of Left parties, and succeeded in stopping the committee's pro-environment recommendations from being implemented. </p><p> Even though the Western Ghats are one of the worst-hit areas in terms of climate change-triggered casualties, especially from landslides and agricultural loss, the electoral politics of the region largely revolve around conventional issues.</p><p> The attitude in the Western Ghats is in stark contrast to Europe, which votes in early June to elect the next European Parliament. A poll conducted by Euronews and Ipsos in 18 countries found that 52 per cent of voters prioritise the fight against climate change over other issues.</p><p> The so-called \"climate voters\" in Europe are mostly young people. One of the hot topics during elections is the European Green Deal, which aims to make the continent climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p> A World Wide Fund for Nature survey showed that European political parties are particularly focused on combating climate change, as they \"shared support for ending fossil fuel use, transitioning to 100 per cent renewable energy and adopting nature-based solutions to tackle climate change\".</p><p> In Europe, green parties that have been actively pushing environmental issues since the 1970s now hold a major share of the vote in many countries, and are putting the climate agenda at the forefront of elections. </p><p> While not a key issue in the Lok Sabha elections, more extreme temperatures have begun to establish new standards for how Indian voters engage with and assess candidates during campaigning.</p><p> An incident encountered during fieldwork in a Lok Sabha constituency in South India, where there is a tight contest between two high-net-worth candidates from the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, illustrates this. A fruit seller devised his own \"political thermometer\" to compare candidates based on their body language during roadshows. </p><p> This campaign tool is less popular in the 2024 general elections due to rising temperatures.</p><p> \"Just look at his downcast face, wearied under the sunlight. Is this AC (air-conditioned)-living guy going to speak for us in parliament? Two days ago, the other candidate passed through this junction in an open jeep. As he did during previous elections, he stood energetically despite the scorching heat, raising his hands to the people with a smile,\" he said. </p><p> In another constituency, people held high regard for an MP who spent hours wearing a local costume and coordinating rescue operations during floods.</p><p> Conservative electoral landscapeAmid the climate crisis, the long-held expectation for any Indian politician to \"be with the people\" now also encompasses standing with them through their lived experiences of climate change.  </p><p> However, Indian democracy is yet to breed a new category of climate voters as its electoral landscape is still conservative, with practically very little space for environmental politics or green agendas. 360INFO</p><p> Sajan Thomas teaches political science at St John's College, Anchal, India, which is affiliated with the University of Kerala.

Another edition of the World Economic Forum (WEF) has come to an end -- but what have we learnt? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Compared with a year ago, the world seems a somewhat different place. Right before the start of the gathering in Davos, WEF released its annual Global Risks Report, effectively a survey of some 1,500 global leaders across business, academia, government and others. Last year, the cost-of-living crisis topped the near-term concerns, alongside nature risks and geo-economic confrontation. This year, the tone is different. \"Misinformation and disinformation\" led the list of near-term fears, with \"societal polarisation\" not far behind. </p><p> In a year in which some four billion people are eligible to vote in an election, conversations at Davos struck a markedly more geopolitical tone. Among the first to open this year of elections, Taiwan has already gone to the polls to vote through a third term of the ruling government, while the United States election will take centre stage later in the year. Markets remain undecided on the outcome, even as discussions on geopolitical conflicts seeped their way into the Davos formal and informal nightcap sessions.</p><p> One thing remains unchanged. While perceptions of near-term risks have shifted, nature risks top the 10-year outlook. Extreme weather events, critical changes to Earth's systems and biodiversity loss head the list of concerns. And with good reason. 2023 was, like the preceding year, the warmest year on record. At a nature dinner organised by Lombard Odier to kick off the week in Davos, Professor Johan Rockstrom reminded the audience that it is now inevitable that the world will overshoot the key 1.5 degree Celsius target, with a best outcome likely seeing increases to at least 1.7 deg C or 1.8 deg C in the coming decades, before we have a hope of returning to the 1.5 deg C target.</p><p> On the Promenade, a central road running through Davos, the sustainability billboards have largely disappeared. Instead, discussions on how to tackle transitions to net zero and, increasingly, a nature-positive economy, have moved from the outdoor signboards to panel discussions and fireside encounters. </p><p> Virtue-signalling is no longer the name of the game; figuring out who has the right strategy and partnerships to quickly adopt cleaner, greener and more efficient business models that can disrupt entire industries is the new play in town. A lone billboard that still declares \"sustainability is just a few steps away!\" feels eerily out of place. Inside the improvised meeting rooms that transform a skiing village into a meeting place for the global who's who, it is all too clear that these transitions will be far from easy, but may yet allow those with the right strategy to leapfrog forward.</p><p> Getting behind AIOutside, other billboards vie for attention. Replacing the proclamations of net-zero commitments are the new signs advertising each business' respective breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). A year ago, the sudden emergence of generative AI was already the word on the snowy streets of Davos. In 2024, AI and discussions on its myriad disruptive effects were on the agenda everywhere. The shift in advertising focus from sustainability to AI is perhaps a sensible one: one represents the challenge, whereas digitally enabled optimisation and innovation may well be a central part of the solution. </p><p> Besides AI, the wooden interiors of the Davos chalets and meeting rooms perhaps provided an appropriate setting for the other topic that ascended up the WEF agenda: nature. From sessions on risks to the global food system, to a heavily over-subscribed \"nature positive dinner\", WEF participants sought to come to grips with an inevitable and increasingly clear realisation: for all the maladies and opportunities facing the global economy, the economy is vitally dependent on the ecosystem services provided by natural capital, the world's single most productive asset. </p><p> The solutions too are beginning to emerge. Recognising the not-so-hidden value of nature is but a mere first step. Encouraging markets to adequately value and allocate capital to its preservation and restoration is the much greater challenge. Shortly before Davos, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures announced that an initial cohort of 320 businesses had signed up to its much-awaited framework aiming to drive the disclosure of nature risks and opportunities. In other roundtables, financial institutions looking to engage on nature recognised that allocation capital to nature-based solutions at scale, in fact, requires us to reconsider asset allocations -- with nature emerging as a new asset class. </p><p> At Lombard Odier's own \"re-nature\" dinner, speakers and the audience explored opportunities to put theory into action, highlighting investment opportunities around the development of regenerative value chains. Coffee is a US$225 billion example, dominated by production from tropical monocultures, often characterised by falling yields and degraded soils, and with as much as half of all coffee production at risk from climate change. Transforming extractive models to ones based on agroforestry and rewilding, and a shortening of value chains to consumers, may be part of the solution to begin to drive more capital to nature at speed and scale. </p><p> Keeping up with a fast-moving worldSo in the end, did Davos 2024 change the world? Perhaps that would be too high an expectation. The world is moving quickly, and perhaps the business community assembled at Davos was struggling to keep up. But, in a year where concern over misinformation and societal cohesion is rife, this year's theme of Rebuilding Trust appeared well-chosen. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer released just before the event, global levels of trust in institutions and leaders have been on the decline, but businesses today are more trusted than government leaders. With innovation and new global challenges facing business leaders and investors, maintaining that trust requires a balancing act. </p><p> To investors, there are plenty of takeaways. Transitions to a decarbonised economy are accelerating. Parallel concerns over energy security, energy affordability and clean energy all point to the single solution of a further ramp-up in investment in new energy systems. Transformation of value chains to more regenerative alternatives will drive investment to new technologies, business models and nature-based solutions. AI will accelerate all of these transitions, enabling solutions that outcompete existing alternatives in terms of efficiency, environmental impact and financial returns. The transition is in motion, and investors on board the Davos trains appeared to be on board. </p><p> The writer is head of sustainability research at Lombard Odier Investment Managers</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Encouraging markets to adequately value and allocate capital to its preservation and restoration is the much greater challenge.

However, while most people say they love plants, they claim they do not have time to care for them or have a green thumb.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Plants are living things. It's not like a piece of furniture where we can put it in a corner and be done with it,\" says Veeraghanta. \"We discovered that service and maintenance were the two biggest bugbears for most people.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She founded Naturethings amid Covid in April 2021 as a \"nature-as-a-service\" platform to help clients care for and maintain their plants. The platform uses services supported by artificial intelligence (AI) to cater to the needs of end-users in urban settings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A WhatsApp chatbot would give regular check-ups and health scans of the plants. Naturethings also added programmes that built daily habits around interacting with green spaces.</p><p>From there, Naturethings evolved into an online marketplace to enable people to shop for goods and services related to plants and plant care, including expert advice on plant maintenance and design consultation via WhatsApp video calls. Given the community of over 15,000 followers and active users of the platform, the AI was able to learn fast.</p><p>Founding team</p><p>When the clients of Naturethings returned to the office after Covid restrictions were lifted, there was an increased demand from corporates to introduce green spaces into their offices. That laid the foundation for the current iteration of Naturethings' B2B (business-to-business) platform.</p><p>As Naturethings evolved, others became convinced of its business model and joined the company. One of the first to join the founding team was Ashwin Dhanasri, Veeraghanta's college friend from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University. Based in Hyderabad, India, Dhanasari joined the company as CTO in 2021, and is building the digital twin technology for Naturethings.</p><p>Veeraghanta's brother, Pavan Veeraghanta, a construction and sustainability leader in the UAE, was initially an adviser to the company as it moved into the commercial real estate space. Based in Dubai, he has been involved in 150 construction and real estate services projects, the latest being Dubai's Museum of the Future. To build the operations and sustainability charter, he quit his full-time job to join Naturethings as COO in 2022. While he continues to be based in Dubai, he has set up a secondary base in Singapore.</p><p>Last year, when Naturethings moved upstream from maintenance to landscape design, Veeraghanta was introduced to Kenneth Lim, a Singaporean tech professional and self-taught landscape designer and horticulturist.</p><p>Lim founded SyncScape in 2007 to undertake landscape design projects. Since then, he has designed the gardens of over 100 houses across Singapore, from terraced houses to Good Class Bungalows. \"Doing such projects energises me,\" he says. \"There's a spiritual side to plants because there's a connection between humans and plants.\"</p><p>Bridge between tech and nature</p><p>For the last 27 years, Lim has been working in the tech sector. \"Traditionally, people in horticulture know little about tech, and people in tech know little about plants. I'm the natural bridge between the tech and natural worlds.\"</p><p>He has found the right fit in Naturethings, where he came on board as the latest member of the founding team and the head of design in 2023. Before, Lim was already a consultant for corporate clients on landscaping issues, but on an ad hoc basis. A particular 314-room, 27-storey hotel downtown was completed in 2016, and the owner was concerned that the green fa\u00e7ade looked patchy even after several years. Lim was brought in as a consultant.</p><p>When inspecting the property, he immediately saw the issue: the intervals between the planter boxes for the facade grilles were too wide. Lim's solution was to insert additional planter box layers of green in between, so instead of intervals of four levels, it was every two levels. The previous variety of plants grew downwards instead of upwards, creating these bald patches. He, therefore, chose plants that climbed upwards. The result? \"The fa\u00e7ade is now very green,\" declares Lim. \"It's no longer patchy.\"</p><p>Generational gardeners</p><p>Lim has also found a kindred spirit in Veeraghanta, as their interest in plants and gardens was passed through the generations: Lim's through his grandfather and father, and Veeraghanta's through her great-grandmother and grandmothers.</p><p>Veeraghanta's great-grandmother had a PhD in Botany and recently passed away at 103. Her maternal grandmother was an urban farmer who \"cooked using everything she grew in her garden\".</p><p>Her paternal grandmother had a vast garden, and her interest lay in flowers, specifically those associated with religious rituals. \"Her house was always open, so people could come in and pluck the flowers from her garden for those rituals,\" recalls Veeraghanta. \"It was like a neighbourhood community gathering place.\"</p><p>However, Veeraghanta followed a different path. After she graduated from business school in India, she took up leadership roles at multinational companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Tata Group and lastly, LVMH's Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Diageo in 2017. She was initially based in Jakarta but later relocated to Kuala Lumpur. After over two years with the French multinational firm, she left and moved to Singapore in January 2020, at the start of Covid.</p><p>In July 2020, she was selected to join Antler as an \"entrepreneur in residence\". She had made a pitch to Antler on a version of Naturethings, and after several iterations, she met some of her early ex-founder friends. But her idea for the business has evolved since then.</p><p>Digital twin technology</p><p>Naturethings has been engaged to provide landscaping and biophilic design in the offices of a Fortune 500 corporate real estate services firm in Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ) Tower 3 and at Six Battery Road in Singapore. As these are actual workplaces, \"the users' primary goal is not to come in and admire the greenery\", says Veeraghanta. \"We want to understand how greenery can contribute to productivity and the corporate ESG goals.\"</p><p>The firm created a digital twin of the office spaces for the corporate client. The plants were also installed with sensors. A digital twin replicates what is happening on the physical site, and the model is helpful, as clients can monitor everything on their dashboard, says Veeraghanta. \"We can already track the density and biodiversity on the site.\"</p><p>Using the digital twin of the space, Naturethings was able to \"deploy optimal evidence-based green solutions at each of the eight zones [of the office at PLQ3], bringing in a high degree of confidence in managing the maintenance via sensors linked to the AI models\", she adds.</p><p>The most significant change is in the communal area, where the low set of plants behind the sofa seats have been removed and deployed elsewhere. Instead, there are now corners with a profusion of plants.</p><p>Naturethings has also created seasonality in the eight zones of the office. \"The office occupants will be able to feel the innate changes in mood and vibrancy coming from how the plants and trees change with the seasons,\" says Veeraghanta.</p><p>Over time, the AI will be able to capture spatial data and augment human action in terms of the maintenance of the plants.

They aim to inform better decision-making by companies and capital providers, and ultimately contribute to a shift in global financial flows towards \"nature-positive outcomes\".</p><p>By January in Davos, there were already 320 early adopters, said McKenzie. \"I'm delighted by the uptake in this region - 42% of those early adopters are in Asia, with very strong uptake in Japan.\"</p><p>Singapore-listed food and agri-business Olam Group was one of the first movers in Singapore.

Sunny Verghese, CEO of Olam International, said: \"Nature is not external to us, for businesses, for economies, for societies and communities [and] for the financial systems. Nature is embedded and intrinsic to this.\"</p><p>Verghese's comments reveal how quickly the conversation has progressed in a matter of years. A video aired on April 15 commemorating 10 years of Ecosperity Week conferences included his comments from 2021, where he said executives like him had committed to emissions reduction targets, but \"not one of us has a clue of how we are going to get there\".

However, it faces a narrow window of opportunity to step up green investment to rein in the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change, says the report by Bain &amp; Company, GenZero, Standard Chartered and Temasek. </p><p> Titled South-east Asia's Green Economy 2024 -- Moving The Needle, the report outlines a range of opportunities for the region to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet national climate targets, while also improving energy and food security. What is missing is US$1.5 trillion in finance, policy incentives and regional cooperation to make this happen, according to the authors. </p><p> A key theme of the report is that many of the green investments can be deployed now and rapidly scaled up to make a real difference in cutting planet-warming emissions that are also causing air pollution across the region. </p><p> \"In South-east Asia, we're seeing opportunities that are extremely actionable in the near term,\" said Ms Kimberly Tan, head of investments at GenZero, an investment platform founded by Temasek that is focused on accelerating decarbonisation. \"We believe that investments into the green economy could generate as much US$300 billion in annual revenues by 2030.\"</p><p> Nature and agriculture, transport and power generation represent US$220 billion of the total revenues. For example, investments in sustainable rice cultivation could cut water use and emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Nature-based solutions such as protecting rainforests and replanting mangroves could suck planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air while benefiting local communities -- mangroves are excellent fish nurseries and protect coastlines from storms. </p><p> Ramping up deployment of wind, solar and battery storage could help the region cut its reliance on coal and gas for power generation, while mandates on energy efficiency in buildings could also reduce electricity demand growth.</p><p> These are among 13 investable ideas across four sectorial themes: nature and agriculture, power generation, transport and buildings highlighted by the report, which was released on the sidelines of Ecosperity Week 2024 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.</p><p> But the financing gap remains vast. The report says green investments in the region rose 20 per cent year on year in 2023 to US$6.3 billion. But this is a fraction of the US$1.5 trillion needed to accelerate South-east Asia's green transition and to meet its 2030 climate pledges under the United Nations Paris climate agreement. </p><p> Mr Dale Hardcastle, director of the global sustainability innovation centre at Bain &amp; Company, told a media briefing on April 11: \"Immense potential exists to accelerate the energy transition and build the green economy. We need to start with what we can do here and now, and not miss the opportunity at hand.\"</p><p> The region's 10 economies are rapidly growing and will need major investments in energy, especially renewable energy for power generation, in the decades ahead. </p><p> For instance, the 7th Asean Energy Outlook, a 2022 report by the Asean Centre for Energy, estimates that electricity generation capacity will more than double between 2025 and 2050 based on the region's current climate policies. Total energy-related greenhouse gas emissions will also double by 2050 to four billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. </p><p> But with the jump in emissions come growing climate risks, notes the report, with Asean already one of the regions highly vulnerable to increasing heat, more intense storms and floods, and rising sea levels. </p><p> By 2030, the region needs to cut emissions by a total of 2.4 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent if it is to meet national climate pledges, the report says. </p><p> Asked what is holding the region back, Mr Hardcastle offered three reasons.</p><p> \"There's the challenge of competing priorities for governments,\" he said. \"Leaders not only have to balance thinking about the post-Covid-19 world, but they also have to balance rapidly growing economies and the need to increase energy.\" He pointed to millions of people still without access to the power grid. </p><p> The second challenge is incumbency, which is the region's deep dependency on fossil fuels for energy. And in some Asean nations, coal, oil and gas are also major sources of export earnings. </p><p> Mr Hardcastle pointed to the region's large and young fleet of coal-fired power stations. Closing these down early and replacing them with renewable energy is a very costly challenge, though efforts are under way to try to figure out how to do this. </p><p> \"Thirdly, we've still not had sufficient incentives or access to capital to be able to move at the pace that we want,\" he said. But he noted progress in new types of financing that help lower the cost and risk of green investments, such as blended finance. This combines public and private money, such as grants, concessional loans and commercial capital. </p><p> \"The change and the transformation we're seeking... is unprecedented,\" he added. </p><p> Ms Tan pointed to the region's low level of renewable energy deployment and nascent electric vehicle industry. Much of its agriculture also remains unsophisticated compared with the large-scale farms in the West, mainly because many smallholders do not have access to technology. </p><p> \"Many of these decarbonisation investment ideas will take time, but you definitely need to act as soon as possible,\" she said. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Nature and agriculture, transport and power generation represent US$220 billion of the total revenues.

These ecosystems also serve as a viable habitat for biodiversity, and provide people with increased food and water security.  </p><p> \"Yet, many lush forests and biodiversity-rich areas are being threatened with deforestation, in the face of lucrative businesses like timber and palm oil,\" said Ms Shakura, 33, who is pursuing her doctorate at the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. </p><p> The issue is particularly pronounced in South-east Asia, which is losing 1.2 per cent of its forests annually for agriculture, food and other raw materials.</p><p> To keep these forests intact, local communities would therefore need the financial incentives to do so.</p><p> So far, the lion's share of such efforts has come from government funding worldwide -- standing at 76 per cent, based on a Bloomberg New Economy Forum report in April. </p><p> This is insufficient to safeguard nature and biodiversity globally, and more private finance would be required to bridge the gap, said Ms Shakura. </p><p> According to the report, about US$160 billion (S$216 billion) a year goes into nature conservation and restoration efforts globally, but there is still a wide financing gap of at least US$803 billion annually.  </p><p> \"Yet, many investors are often not as willing to fund nature-based solutions, perhaps because of their risk appetite -- many want quicker returns, or feel that they need to see tangible results before deciding to put in their money.</p><p> \"But investing in nature requires one to play the long game. Think about how long it takes for a sapling to grow into a tree,\" she added.   </p><p> The good news is that interest from investors is growing, and Ms Shakura is currently working on more innovative ways of raising the much-needed finance for nature in the Asia-Pacific region. </p><p> One such way is to repurpose environmentally harmful subsidies, like agricultural subsidies, to support green efforts instead. A World Bank report in June found that agricultural subsidies are responsible for the loss of 2.2 million ha of forest per year, or 14 per cent of global deforestation. </p><p> Prior to taking up her course, Ms Shakura did an internship at Conservation International Singapore as part of her master's programme in biodiversity conservation. The stint opened her eyes to the issues that non-governmental organisations often face when it comes to implementing projects on the ground -- one of which is the need for early-stage financing.  </p><p> For instance, to reforest a degraded plot of land, financing is needed to begin planting new trees, followed by the need for tracking and monitoring equipment to measure the amount of CO2 that has been trapped and stored away from the atmosphere. </p><p> There is also the human aspect of these nature-based projects, which is to ensure that the livelihoods of indigenous people and local communities are being accounted for, said Ms Shakura. </p><p> \"For instance, are their knowledge and values being taken into consideration? These people are the custodians of their land, and we must think about how we can effectively empower them.\" </p><p> Her five-year stint with Temasek's sustainable solutions team also gave her insights into the business case for nature-climate solutions, and the enabling conditions for investments to be made into such projects.  </p><p> Ms Shakura will be attending the United Nations' climate summit, COP28, from Nov 30 to Dec 12. </p><p> She hopes to track how countries are integrating nature into their climate mitigation strategies, and whether sufficient finance is channelled into nature to see these mitigation goals come to fruition. </p><p> Reports have shown that less than 10 per cent of climate finance thus far has gone into nature, she noted.  </p><p> Countries have also pledged to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030, but there are indications that the world is off-track in achieving this target.</p><p> \"I hope to track the progress of this goal, and to check if the ambition is still there,\" she added.</p><p> As to why she decided to take the leap from the private sector to academia in January, Ms Shakura said: \"I see myself as playing the long game. Being in academia also allows me to (tackle the nature-financing issue) from a neutral perspective, whereas in the public or private sector, there are certain expectations to meet, be it looking after the economy or ensuring profitability. </p><p> \"But in academia, you get to integrate the viewpoints of different stakeholders and find innovative ways to address these problems.\"</p><p> Ms Shakura, who has a bachelor's degree in environmental engineering, got her start at the Economic Development Board, where she helped to bring cleaner, more energy-efficient water technologies to market.</p><p> But her interest in sustainability was inspired by her father, who at the time was working on air quality policy at the National Environment Agency. </p><p> \"I saw the importance of that, and thought to follow his footsteps,\" said Ms Shakura.</p><p> And what drives her to keep going, especially when the work seems unceasing'</p><p> \"My young daughter,\" said Ms Shakura. </p><p> \"Just thinking about her future, and the fact that our generation's actions will determine the kind of world she will live in...

At the UN Climate Change Conference 2023, also known as COP-28, the UAE COP-28 Presidency announced four paradigm shifts: (a) fast-tracking the energy transition; (b) transforming climate finance; (c) putting nature, people, lives, and livelihoods at the heart of climate action, and (d) ensuring inclusivity. The four paradigm shifts were aimed at galvanising the global community at COP-28 to close the implementation gap needed to keep the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.<br/><br/>2.These shifts are aligned with Singapore's climate ambition and the United Nations' (UN) 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Singapore's participation at COP-28 helped to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in several ways.<br/><br/>3. First, we supported the UAE COP-28 Presidency and the global shared climate agenda by, inter alia, co-facilitating ministerial consultations on climate mitigation and co-chairing the joint contact group for the First Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement. These efforts contributed to the successful adoption of the UAE Consensus. The UAE Consensus calls on countries to transition away from fossil fuels, accelerate the phasedown of unabated coal power, phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency globally by 2030. These are important initiatives that will better position the world towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 13 on Climate Action.<br/><br/>4. Second, Singapore contributed to global efforts in strengthening resource resilience in key areas such as food and water, in line with SDG 2 on Zero Hunger and SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation. Singapore was among 159 countries that signed the COP-28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action. The Declaration's intent is to strengthen the resilience of agriculture and food systems to the impacts of climate through closer collaboration and partnerships. We also participated actively in key discussions like the Informal Ministerial Meeting on the Follow-up of the UN 2030 Water Conference, which continued discussion on key issues such as strategies to improve global water quality and sanitation.<br/><br/>5. Third, Singapore launched initiatives and platforms to facilitate cooperation towards the SDGs. These include the FAST-P (Financing Asia's Transition Partnership) blended finance initiative which aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion (S$6.7 billion) for Asia's energy transition, and agreements on carbon market cooperation with countries such as Costa Rica, Fiji, Rwanda, Senegal and Papua New Guinea. The COP-28 Singapore Pavilion also hosted more than 70 events that drew over 6,000 visitors, and served as a platform for facilitating partnerships in sectors such as finance, water and food, transport and nature-based solutions to address sustainable development challenges.<br/><br/>6. Singapore's active participation at COP-28 is a testament to our support for global efforts to implement the SDGs. Singapore supports the UAE Consensus and will work to implement its outcomes, including through the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which is our whole-of-nation blueprint aligned with the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.</p><p>[Category: Regulatory and Legal, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["These include the FAST-P (Financing Asia's Transition Partnership) blended finance initiative which aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion (S$6. 7 billion) for Asia's energy transition, and agreements on carbon market cooperation with countries such as Costa Rica, Fiji, Rwanda, Senegal and Papua New Guinea. 6.

Less than 1 per cent have actually thought about the dependencies their business model has on nature,\" said Mr Peter Bakker, president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.</p><p> But there is hope, and new types of financing can help make the case for investing in nature. The key is making the climate connection. </p><p> \"One way of actually addressing the worst impacts of climate change, one of the cheapest and faster ways of doing this, is actually investing in nature,\" Mr Teo told The Straits Times. </p><p> \"For us, the way we are thinking about making it work is that we derive alternative revenue streams from our nature investments, which includes revenues from carbon credit sales,\" he said, pointing to money generated from projects that remove CO2 from the air or avoid CO2 or other greenhouse gases, such as methane, being emitted -- for instance, investing in more efficient rice cultivation, or reforestation or afforestation.</p><p> Other revenue streams could be timber from sustainable forestry, and products from sustainable agriculture. \"These (revenue streams) are quite useful because people now want to also provide a little bit of risk mitigation just in case something goes wrong with the carbon markets, or carbon prices decline dramatically,\" he said. </p><p> Speakers during panel discussions lamented the accelerating loss and destruction of nature, and how this will only threaten human livelihoods and economies. </p><p> It will also worsen the climate crisis because ecosystems including rainforests, mangroves, seagrass meadows, grasslands and soils soak up large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air, playing a key role in regulating the potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. </p><p> Damaging and destroying these key natural systems, for example by clearing for agriculture, mining and urban development, leads to more CO2 in the air and species loss, and affects the local climate. </p><p> Overshadowing the conference was confirmation from the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that the world's coral reefs are in the throes of a global bleaching event caused by record ocean temperatures. It is the fourth such global event on record, and Australia's Great Barrier Reef, in particular, is suffering severe and widespread bleaching -- its fifth in eight years. </p><p> Reefs are vital for fisheries and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people. Their economic value has been estimated at US$2.7 trillion annually.</p><p> \"When global warming happens, you will have more species loss, and when you have more species loss, that will also result in more global warming,\" said Mr Sunny Verghese, CEO of Olam International. \"So these existential challenges of climate change, collapse of biodiversity, livelihoods and growing inequity are interlinked, and we need to address this as a whole system.\"</p><p> For Olam, as an agri-business supplying food and other materials, the health of the natural world is critical to the firm's bottom line -- especially pollinators, he said. </p><p> According to the World Economic Forum, about 75 per cent of crops depend on pollinators such as bees, birds and beetles. Yet recent declines in bees from pollution, land clearance and climate change have cost food producers, including Olam, millions of dollars in lost revenue. </p><p> Professor Partha Dasgupta, a leading thinker on the economics of biodiversity, told the conference that nature is a one-stop shop for products and services for humanity. Climate regulation is only one part of the services it provides.</p><p> \"We should not talk about climate and nature separately,\" he said. Nature provides goods that everyone needs, such as food, water, timber and ingredients to make pharmaceuticals -- \"the stuff we harvest and mine\", said Prof Dasgupta, the Frank Ramsey Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Cambridge.</p><p> But crucially, nature also provides services that are far less visible but essential. In addition to pollination, this includes nitrogen fixation, production of oxygen, water cleansing by wetlands and decomposition of waste.</p><p> And all of these natural services are interconnected, he said. </p><p> So how to speed up nature-based investments? Currently, a lot of nature investments rely on concessionary capital from government grants and philanthropic funding. But this is not enough. Debt financing at scale could really get nature investments moving, said Mr Teo, because it has a lower cost of capital than equity financing.</p><p> \"Debt financing is a way to unlock resources towards supporting nature,\" he said. Crowding in debt financing with concessionary capital and philanthropic funds will lower the costs and spread the risks of investments. </p><p> But the speakers, as in all climate and biodiversity conferences these days, noted that time was very short to pull the planet back from the brink of catastrophic impacts from climate change and loss of nature, such as faster melting of ice caps or loss of the Amazon rainforest. </p><p> British polar explorer Robert Swan, 67, had a final message for the conference: \"I believe the last great exploration left on Earth is for us as a species to survive on Earth.

Malaysia's Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Minister Nik Nazmi blames fires abroad for unhealthy air levels in Kuala Lumpur and other urban centres; Indonesia, however, quickly questions and counters to suggest that Malaysian companies are involved. Finger-pointing is often the response during bad haze episodes. Otherwise, while complaining, many just bear the situation as a temporary nuisance, counting on changing winds and year-end rains to bring respite. Yet, real and enduring concerns emerge for businesses. </p><p>This would, first and foremost, involve companies producing palm oil, pulp and paper as well as other products often implicated in outbreaks of fire. But broader effects are felt, since this is a sizeable sector involving some of the largest companies of Indonesia and Malaysia, and some listed entities in Singapore. Manufacturers that use these products in their supply chains can feel the ripples; so might investors and financial institutions. Two dangers and one considerable opportunity bear special attention.Adding heat to the firesThe first danger comes now that the Indonesian authorities are clamping down on the use of fire, which is illegal for businesses. Indonesian authorities are currently pressing legal charges against 11 companies with land concessions in South Sumatra; another 200-plus firms in Kalimantan and other areas have been warned over fires in or near their areas.Using satellite and hot-spot data, the focus of possible prosecution is on where the fires are burning - and not who started it. Companies with large concessions can therefore face sanctions even if, as many claim, fires were started by nearby smallholders before spreading into their land. Enforcement measures include imprisonment and hefty fines. Offending companies can also find their concessions sealed off during investigations, interrupting regular operations. There is also reputational risk from illegal and harmful behaviour, that will concern buyers, bankers and investors. Across different provinces, fire prevention and enforcement readiness on the part of the local authorities can be uneven. But the Jokowi administration is pushing for quick and tough action and has asked the national disaster authorities, police and military to respond to the ongoing situation. For good reason.Over his two terms, President Joko Widodo has initiated reform and touts these improvements as part of his legacy. The same is true for his Minister of Environment and Forestry Siti Nurbaya Bakar, one of the few ministers to have served throughout Jokowi's presidency, through Cabinet reshuffles.Efforts have been made to bring the agribusiness sector and large plantation businesses into line. Only last year, prominent palm oil business leaders were prosecuted for corruption, accused of circumventing price controls and export restrictions during the country's domestic shortage. There is some expectation that such government efforts will continue even in the last months before elections. For some businesses, this will add heat to the fires. Making a poor situation worseOther factors potentially make the present poor situation worse. One is the weather, the major driver of the fires. The drier conditions at present result from two phenomena - El Nino and the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. The weather remains very unpredictable but the dry season could possibly last longer, until perhaps November, and delay the usual rainy season. Moreover, El Nino tends to be a multi-year phenomenon, and this could also increase fire risks in 2024. The situation could be further compounded by climate change bringing prolonged hot and dry spells, as the world witnessed this year.A second negative factor is business sentiment, perhaps most notably in palm oil. Many large producers did well of late, on the back of record-high prices. Conditions, however, may now be changing. Some producers complain about elevated costs of inputs and labour, even as productivity remains low and market prices generally soften. Several publicly listed companies are seeing their share prices trending downwards, and some red ink is on the books.These business concerns tend to impact commitments to battle fires and improve sustainability - efforts that involve considerable time, effort and money. For instance, some companies have invested to increase fire-fighting capabilities and equipment as well as provide incentives and training for local villages to be \"fire-free\". There are also efforts to conserve parcels of land for carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and ensure peatlands retain sufficient water to remain resilient to fire during dry periods.Some companies consider these initiatives as fundamental, and may hope to enhance investor appeal. But others may rethink such practices as margins shrink and pressure mounts to trim expenditures. The temptation to use fire - still the fastest and cheapest method to clear land - can grow. Headlong expansion or greener pathMany plantations started in the late 1990s to early 2000s and are entering a replanting cycle. Replanting should be done sustainably and many businesses already practise phased replanting to refresh some forest sites each year. Others, however, do not, and face a situation with debt and weak balance sheets as well as declining yields and the need to spend on replanting. Replanting and opening new areas can therefore run the risk of triggering more fires. This is especially if the next government in Indonesia were to revoke the present moratorium on granting new concession permits for primary forests, and license more land-clearing. The better alternative is to seek a greener, more sustainable path. Growth would be measured not in the physical expansion of plantations, but in terms of productivity, value to global buyers, and attraction to investors. Demands for that greener path are coming from not only within the best companies but also from the biggest buyers, financial institutions and investors. Greening the sector can secure supply chains against deforestation, reduce carbon emissions, and ensure that the region is free of fires. Potentially, this would be funded in part by philanthropy and also by generating carbon credits and offering \"nature-based solutions\" to sequester carbon and reduce emissions. There is a timeliness in this as Indonesia has just launched an emissions-trading system. This is currently a voluntary scheme for only the coal power sector, but there are hopes to expand, with projects for forest conservation and against fires presenting a considerable opportunity.There remain many factors for nature-based solutions and conservation credits to be accepted and generate revenue. One key factor would be trust. The haze and fires, if prolonged and chronic, can burn that up, and cloud any positive prospects. Agribusinesses and plantations continue to be important for our region. The sector contributes significantly to the overall economy, especially in rural areas, and involves many - indeed millions - as smallholders. In particular, palm oil in Indonesia has expanded greatly over the past 30 years and plays a vital part in the country's growth path to become a US trillion-dollar economy. It also plays a major role in the Malaysian economy. But business-as-usual in this sector cannot continue. Linked to deeper concerns about deforestation and the release of climate change emissions is the key challenge of addressing the fires and the haze for the sector and the major corporations involved. Much can turn for companies in the current rush for fire-fighting, the flurry of investigations, and shifting market trends. But even more will depend on the emerging politics and policies in Indonesia and the global expectations that will shape the conditions for business.

Species like the spotted scat, purple climber crabs and gobies were found in the vicinity of the reef bags, said Ms Yokoyama. </p><p> These were not present during the initial survey before the project started.  </p><p> Apart from providing refuge for marine life, oysters are filter feeders and can remove sediments, algae, suspended particles and nutrients like nitrogen, helping to prevent algae blooms, for instance. </p><p> Clearer water will also help other habitats such as seagrasses and corals to thrive, she added.</p><p> Being hardy, oysters are able to cope with various environmental stresses and can thrive in warmer waters, such as in Singapore and South-east Asia. </p><p> Placing the oyster reef in the intertidal zone will also help with wave dissipation as it will act as a natural breakwater. </p><p> This could also help accumulate sediments and reduce erosion, which would create favourable conditions for mangroves to grow.  </p><p> Oyster reef projects have taken off around the globe, but are still considered a novel solution in the region.</p><p> In Australia, The Nature Conservancy runs shellfish reef restoration projects around the country where oyster and mussel shells are recycled to rehabilitate these once-abundant reef habitats that have been lost to overexploitation, pollution and disease.</p><p> Various reef restoration projects have sprouted across the United States, with projects in New York City, Texas and South Carolina.  </p><p> Closer to home, a Save Our Shells campaign by The Nature Conservancy was launched in Hong Kong, in a bid to reduce the amount of waste being sent to its three landfills, which are expected to be full by the 2030s. </p><p> In Hong Kong, food waste accounted for about 30 per cent of municipal solid waste in 2022. </p><p> Ms Yokoyama's team is already seeing interest from some hotels in the region, which are keen to explore nature-based solutions for coastal protection and improve marine biodiversity. </p><p> She added: \"In South-east Asia, oyster reefs have long been an under-looked solution. </p><p> \"But as they are a lot more hardy and less picky compared with other coastal ecosystems, they are able to provide a myriad of benefits to the region, which is vulnerable to rising sea levels and has lost many of its coastal habitats and biodiversity to development.\" </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Closer to home, a Save Our Shells campaign by The Nature Conservancy was launched in Hong Kong, in a bid to reduce the amount of waste being sent to its three landfills, which are expected to be full by the 2030s.

Malaysia's Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Minister Nik Nazmi blames fires abroad for unhealthy air levels in Kuala Lumpur and other urban centres; Indonesia, however, quickly questions and counters to suggest that Malaysian companies are involved. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Finger-pointing is often the response during bad haze episodes. Otherwise, while complaining, many just bear the situation as a temporary nuisance, counting on changing winds and year-end rains to bring respite. Yet, real and enduring concerns emerge for businesses. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This would, first and foremost, involve companies producing palm oil, pulp and paper as well as other products often implicated in outbreaks of fire. But broader effects are felt, since this is a sizeable sector involving some of the largest companies of Indonesia and Malaysia, and some listed entities in Singapore. Manufacturers that use these products in their supply chains can feel the ripples; so might investors and financial institutions. </p><p> Two dangers and one considerable opportunity bear special attention.</p><p> Adding heat to the firesThe first danger comes now that the Indonesian authorities are clamping down on the use of fire, which is illegal for businesses. Indonesian authorities are currently pressing legal charges against 11 companies with land concessions in South Sumatra; another 200-plus firms in Kalimantan and other areas have been warned over fires in or near their areas.</p><p> Using satellite and hot-spot data, the focus of possible prosecution is on where the fires are burning -- and not who started it. Companies with large concessions can therefore face sanctions even if, as many claim, fires were started by nearby smallholders before spreading into their land. </p><p> Enforcement measures include imprisonment and hefty fines. Offending companies can also find their concessions sealed off during investigations, interrupting regular operations. There is also reputational risk from illegal and harmful behaviour, that will concern buyers, bankers and investors. </p><p> Across different provinces, fire prevention and enforcement readiness on the part of the local authorities can be uneven. But the Jokowi administration is pushing for quick and tough action and has asked the national disaster authorities, police and military to respond to the ongoing situation. For good reason.</p><p> Over his two terms, President Joko Widodo has initiated reform and touts these improvements as part of his legacy. The same is true for his Minister of Environment and Forestry Siti Nurbaya Bakar, one of the few ministers to have served throughout Jokowi's presidency, through Cabinet reshuffles.</p><p> Efforts have been made to bring the agribusiness sector and large plantation businesses into line. Only last year, prominent palm oil business leaders were prosecuted for corruption, accused of circumventing price controls and export restrictions during the country's domestic shortage. There is some expectation that such government efforts will continue even in the last months before elections. For some businesses, this will add heat to the fires. </p><p> Making a poor situation worseOther factors potentially make the present poor situation worse. One is the weather, the major driver of the fires. </p><p> The drier conditions at present result from two phenomena -- El Nino and the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. The weather remains very unpredictable but the dry season could possibly last longer, until perhaps November, and delay the usual rainy season. </p><p> Moreover, El Nino tends to be a multi-year phenomenon, and this could also increase fire risks in 2024. The situation could be further compounded by climate change bringing prolonged hot and dry spells, as the world witnessed this year.</p><p> A second negative factor is business sentiment, perhaps most notably in palm oil. Many large producers did well of late, on the back of record-high prices. Conditions, however, may now be changing. Some producers complain about elevated costs of inputs and labour, even as productivity remains low and market prices generally soften. Several publicly listed companies are seeing their share prices trending downwards, and some red ink is on the books.</p><p> These business concerns tend to impact commitments to battle fires and improve sustainability -- efforts that involve considerable time, effort and money. For instance, some companies have invested to increase fire-fighting capabilities and equipment as well as provide incentives and training for local villages to be \"fire-free\". There are also efforts to conserve parcels of land for carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and ensure peatlands retain sufficient water to remain resilient to fire during dry periods.</p><p> Some companies consider these initiatives as fundamental, and may hope to enhance investor appeal. But others may rethink such practices as margins shrink and pressure mounts to trim expenditures. The temptation to use fire -- still the fastest and cheapest method to clear land -- can grow. </p><p> Headlong expansion or greener pathMany plantations started in the late 1990s to early 2000s and are entering a replanting cycle. Replanting should be done sustainably and many businesses already practise phased replanting to refresh some forest sites each year. </p><p> Others, however, do not, and face a situation with debt and weak balance sheets as well as declining yields and the need to spend on replanting. Replanting and opening new areas can therefore run the risk of triggering more fires. This is especially if the next government in Indonesia were to revoke the present moratorium on granting new concession permits for primary forests, and license more land-clearing. </p><p> The better alternative is to seek a greener, more sustainable path. Growth would be measured not in the physical expansion of plantations, but in terms of productivity, value to global buyers, and attraction to investors. Demands for that greener path are coming from not only within the best companies but also from the biggest buyers, financial institutions and investors. Greening the sector can secure supply chains against deforestation, reduce carbon emissions, and ensure that the region is free of fires. </p><p> Potentially, this would be funded in part by philanthropy and also by generating carbon credits and offering \"nature-based solutions\" to sequester carbon and reduce emissions. There is a timeliness in this as Indonesia has just launched an emissions-trading system. This is currently a voluntary scheme for only the coal power sector, but there are hopes to expand, with projects for forest conservation and against fires presenting a considerable opportunity.</p><p> There remain many factors for nature-based solutions and conservation credits to be accepted and generate revenue. One key factor would be trust. The haze and fires, if prolonged and chronic, can burn that up, and cloud any positive prospects. </p><p> Agribusinesses and plantations continue to be important for our region. The sector contributes significantly to the overall economy, especially in rural areas, and involves many -- indeed millions -- as smallholders. In particular, palm oil in Indonesia has expanded greatly over the past 30 years and plays a vital part in the country's growth path to become a US trillion-dollar economy. It also plays a major role in the Malaysian economy. </p><p> But business-as-usual in this sector cannot continue. Linked to deeper concerns about deforestation and the release of climate change emissions is the key challenge of addressing the fires and the haze for the sector and the major corporations involved. Much can turn for companies in the current rush for fire-fighting, the flurry of investigations, and shifting market trends. But even more will depend on the emerging politics and policies in Indonesia and the global expectations that will shape the conditions for business. </p><p> The writer is chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA), which convenes the annual Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Demands for that greener path are coming from not only within the best companies but also from the biggest buyers, financial institutions and investors.

Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to give a combined reply to PQs number 5, 6, and 7, in today's Order Paper?<br/><br/>2. Sir, my response will also cover matters raised in the question by Associate Professor Jamus Lim, scheduled for the subsequent sitting on 10 January. I invite the Member to seek clarifications if need be. If the question has been addressed, it may not be necessary to proceed with the question for future sittings.<br/><br/>Environmental Considerations and Mitigation Measures<br/><br/>3. Sir, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Louis Ng have asked about the environmental impact of the 'Long Island' reclamation.<br/><br/>4. As with all other land reclamation projects, before we proceed with the 'Long Island' reclamation, detailed environmental studies will be conducted to assess the environmental impacts, and to develop appropriate mitigating measures. These studies will take into account surrounding marine habitats, including intertidal flats and coral communities. We will also explore ways to incorporate nature-based solutions into the design of Long Island to minimise the environmental impact of the reclamation, as we seek to tackle the effects of sea-level rise. We will engage the nature community, academics and researchers, and the public for feedback on the environmental studies and mitigation measures, before commencing reclamation work.<br/><br/>Planning of developments in East Coast Parkway and Long Island<br/><br/>5. Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the considerations for and the impact of the planned developments at East Coast Parkway and 'Long Island'.<br/><br/>6. Our key considerations are the need for coastal protection for the low-lying East Coast area due to future sea-level rise, and the need to create land to meet Singapore's longer-term developmental needs. 'Long Island' will integrate coastal protection measures with our reclamation plans, while strengthening our flood resilience and our water supply. It offers an integrated solution to meet the multiple needs of future generations, including the building of new homes with a quality living environment comprising coastal and reservoir parks, and amenities, as well as creating new jobs. By reclaiming 'Long Island' away from the current coastline, we can achieve coastal protection, the strengthening of our water supply, and creation of new tracts of land, while retaining the existing East Coast Park largely as it is.<br/><br/>7. Given its scale, planning and implementing of 'Long Island' will take a few decades. We are only at the very beginning of the process - kickstarting environmental and engineering studies to determine feasibility, as well as the shape and form of 'Long Island'. At a later stage, agencies will undertake further studies to ensure that the area is well developed, with quality housing, network of new green spaces integrated with East Coast Park, and good transport connectivity. We recognise that many people and stakeholders will be keen to understand and know more about the project and how it may potentially impact them; residents, businesses, nature and heritage groups, the sporting and water sports community, park users, maritime industry and many more groups. That is why we are starting our planning and engagement early.<br/><br/>8. Associate Professor Jamus Lim asked about the source of reclamation sand.<br/><br/>9. The import of reclamation sand to Singapore is conducted on a commercial basis, and sand is imported from a variety of sources.<br/><br/>10. Importers must abide by the laws and regulations of source countries. These include sourcing from legally permissible areas, obtaining the proper export documentation and permits from the relevant authorities, as well as complying with local environmental regulations governing proper extraction and transport within source countries. Where applicable, our agencies will check that the necessary environmental related approvals from source countries are in order before contractors are allowed to commence sand imports.</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Energy, Regulatory and Legal]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["As with all other land reclamation projects, before we proceed with the 'Long Island' reclamation, detailed environmental studies will be conducted to assess the environmental impacts, and to develop appropriate mitigating measures.

Instead of being rich and dark, the red soil is barren and desert-like, robbed of nutrients -- scars from the monoculture farming that has taken place on this land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As our group of about 20 walks, Mr Chua urges us to ponder over the state of the degraded soil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We are not just here to learn, but to also observe and feel. Some of us who are more sensitive may feel pain, anger and sadness, wondering why we have done this to our land. But it's okay to let yourself feel as much as possible,\" he says.</p><p> It is the first sign that this is not your usual farm tour. In February, I visited A Little Wild's (ALW) monthly open farm day in Kota Tinggi, a town in Johor, Malaysia. </p><p> Online, the ALW team outlines its plan to transform a 55ha land parcel, which has been a palm oil plantation since the 1980s, into an educational agroforest flourishing with fruits and vegetables. But I did not fully grasp what that meant until my visit.</p><p> A land scarredAs the group traipses through the first plot of palm oil trees, co- founder Imran Hassan, the farm's 38-year-old full-time manager, explains the origins of monoculture farming in industrial agriculture. This refers to the practice of growing one, or a few, crop species at a time.</p><p> Large-scale monoculture plantations were established in South-east Asia by the early capitalist endeavours of European colonists. These ranged from rubber and coffee to tea and palm oil plantations. </p><p> This intensive farming system forces the land into an unnatural state, where yields and uniformity are prized. Farmers use chemicals to kill pests, weeds and organisms in the soil.</p><p> As a result, people are eating very \"stressed fruits\" that rely on costly and resource-intensive methods. Soil is viewed as a lifeless medium, its quality steadily stripped of its natural nutrients and complex life, says Mr Imran, who has worked in various regenerative farms and other projects across South-east Asia since 2010. </p><p> Soil destruction creates a vicious circle. When topsoil deteriorates, it loses its ability to hold carbon below and above ground. This carbon is released into the atmosphere, causing the planet to get hotter. More difficult soil and climate conditions require more chemicals and pesticides to achieve the same yields. </p><p> ALW's guiding ethos is to help the land heal. </p><p> \"Every land dreams of becoming a forest,\" says Mr Chua, one of the farm's four founders along with Mr Imran and two more friends. </p><p> The quartet founded the farm in 2020, coming together through their shared disillusionment with the modern food system. </p><p> They saw food production, in addition to being a cause of chronic diseases, as accelerating biodiversity loss and climate change. </p><p> The land was bought with a goal of showing that regenerative agriculture can be financially viable, and to share their experience and applied research with current and aspiring farmers who want to transform the food production system.</p><p> Mr Chua spends four to five days a week at the farm, where he helps out in the plots, supports the building of new facilities, assists with tours and workshops and manages volunteers. </p><p> A former public servant working in Singapore and civil engineer with a master's degree in public policy, he also co-founded Feed Our Loved Ones (Folo), a community farm in Johor using compost made out of food waste to produce organic vegetables.</p><p> To heal the landALW bills itself as South-east Asia's first commercial-scale syntropic agroforestry farm. This means it does not rely on irrigation, with no agricultural inputs such as chemical fertilisers, weedicides and pesticides.</p><p> Founders draw inspiration from Swiss farmer Ernst Gotsch, who pioneered the syntropic farming movement. This approach mimics natural ecosystems by integrating diverse crops and trees, enhancing soil fertility and biodiversity.</p><p> Having experimented with syntropic agroforestry for the last three years, Mr Chua says this is one of the best nature-based solutions in the tropics to heal soil life -- regenerating forests and drawing down carbon while growing food.</p><p> \"Syntropic agroforestry is a solution that does not require more intense energy and resource extraction because it harnesses the billion-year wisdom of the tropical forest in harvesting the sun, the rain and nutrients to sustain life,\" he explains.</p><p> At ALW, the process looks like this. </p><p> Initially, degraded soil supports only pioneer species, normally known as weeds, such as mimosa, senduduk and lalang. So, farmers choose the best weeds -- typically mombasa grass which regrows fast and produces plenty of biomass (organic matter such as wood, forest residue or plant material) -- to enrich the barren soil. </p><p> From there, the team plants varieties of species in layers, based on their complementary characteristics. Diversity is key, with more than 80 species in every tree row to mimic the stratification, natural succession and dynamics of a biodiverse rainforest.</p><p> Towering above the forest are emergent trees -- such as the acacia, coconut and durian -- which require constant sunlight. </p><p> Next are the canopy trees that do not mind a bit of shade, like the jackfruit or rambutan tree, followed by the medium layer, which includes mangosteen and lime. Finally, they plant the low- lying layer of coffee, cacao and ginger family plants. </p><p> Mr Chua says that when they mimic the agro-ecological conditions of nature, trees are able to act as a community, building collective resilience to ward off diseases and insects. </p><p> As we meander through the lush greenery, we witness how the land has slowly come back to life. The soil is dark and moist, packed with mycelium, bacteria and all types of organisms. Now, the forest is home to civet cats, wild boars and the like. We pause by the water body, which plays host to a resident eagle and heron. </p><p> Along the way, we chance upon other delightful sights, including a field of tall Mexican sunflowers surrounded by butterflies, red dragon fruit perched on thorny leaves, sweet papayas and flowering coffee trees in abundance. </p><p> The output is modest as the agroforest system is young and the soil is still healing, but the farmers are grateful for its output. The farm has produced pineapples, papayas, 15 types of bananas and rollinia (similar to custard apples), along with a scattering of passion fruit, dragon fruit and breadfruit. </p><p> The farm sends around 120kg of produce to Singapore each week, including to customers who order fruits delivered to their doorstep and to restaurants, such as farm-to-table joint Air CCCC in Dempsey. </p><p> Lessons from the landPart history lesson, part activism and part philosophy lecture, sprinkled with spiritual teachings, the tour takes us on a surprisingly emotional journey.</p><p> We learn that each plant and tree plays its own unique roles to help one another blossom.</p><p> Take, for instance, the sun-loving papaya, which needs fairly good soil over a period of three to five years. To help it thrive, the ALW team plants a tall acacia tree to supply it with nitrogen and a companion ciku plant so that the papaya grows vigorously to take care of it. </p><p> More than process, agroforestry carries a philosophy.</p><p> Near a shady plot of banana plants, Mr Chua poses a question to the group: What does the banana do to help the land become a forest'</p><p> Because of its large size, each banana produces a lot of biomass and oxygen.

Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Albert Chua and United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink met in Singapore on 27 February 2024, to co-chair the 6th United States-Singapore Strategic Partnership Dialogue. Building on the enduring strength of the bilateral strategic partnership, the Dialogue reviewed ongoing areas of cooperation and discussed ways to further advance robust approaches to emerging challenges and mutually beneficial areas, such as in critical and emerging technologies (CET), energy, climate change, and regional capacity building.</p><p>2. The co-chairs reaffirmed the strong defence and security partnership underpinned by the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding Regarding United States Use of Facilities in Singapore, the 2005 Strategic Framework Agreement for a Closer Cooperation Partnership in Defence and Security and accompanying 2005 Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA), and the 2015 Enhanced DCA. Both sides benefit from U.S. forces' access to military facilities in Singapore, which supports the United States' presence in and engagement of the region, as well as from the United States' provision of overseas training and technology access to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Our two militaries also participate in overseas operations together, including during the SAF's ongoing deployment for Operation Prosperity Guardian under Combined Task Force 153: Red Sea Maritime Security. The co-chairs reiterated the governments' December 19 joint statement along with over 40 other partners condemning Houthi interference with navigational rights and freedoms in the waters around the Arabian Peninsula, particularly the Red Sea. The co-chairs welcomed the recent signing of the Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) between the U.S.Department of Defense and Singapore Ministry of Defence in December 2023 that would enable both sides to better address unanticipated supply chain disruptions that could affect defence needs. They also lauded the recently held 7th Law Enforcement and Homeland Security and Safety Cooperation Dialogue,which focused on the growing threat of cybercrime and online scams as well as a wide range of law enforcement and homeland security issues. They noted the continued progress of the bilateral Cyber Dialogue, which was now in its third year.<br/><br/>3. The co-chairs welcomed the 20th Anniversary of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) this year. The USSFTA, which has been in force since 2004, is a linchpin in the bilateral economic relationship and testament to the strong economic and business ties between the two countries. The co-chairs also took stock of progress under the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation (PGI), launched by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong in October 2021, and looked forward to further cooperation under this initiative. The PGI aims to strengthen trade and investment collaboration between the two economies in new and forward-looking areas, as reflected in joint statements released following the PGI annual dialogues in October 2022 and June 2023. In addition, the co-chairs noted the close cooperation between Singapore and the United States on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). Both sides welcomed the significant outcomes announced to date, which will support the continued and constructive economic engagement among the United States, Singapore, and other IPEF partners in the region and provide a firm foundation to further deepen regional cooperation. They include the entry into force of the SupplyChain Agreement on 24 February 2024, and the substantial conclusion of negotiations on the Clean Economy and Fair Economy Agreements, as well as the Agreement on IPEF. Both sides looked forward to continuing to work closely together to implement these Agreements to deliver concrete benefits to all the IPEF partners.<br/><br/>4. The co-chairs discussed emerging areas of cooperation in areas such as CET, climate change, and energy. Both sides welcomed the launch of the inaugural U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue in October 2023 and looked forward to greater collaboration in artificial intelligence (AI), digital economy and data governance, biotechnology, critical infrastructure and technology supply chains, defence innovation, as well as quantum information science and technology.Both sides also discussed progress on the U.S.-Singapore Climate Partnership (USCP) which was launched in August 2021 and updated in June 2023. Notable progress has been made on regional energy transition, low- and zero-emission technologies and solutions, nature-based solutions and carbon markets workstreams and capacity building. On energy, the co-chairs underscored their support for ASEAN's clean energy transition and the realisation of the ASEAN Power Grid. The co-chairs also discussed partnership on civil nuclear energy cooperation to support Singapore's capability building in nuclear safety, security, nonproliferation,and understanding of advanced civil nuclear energy technologies, as part of Singapore's efforts to study all potential pathways for decarbonisation.<br/><br/>5. The co-chairs re-affirmed the close collaboration between Singapore and the United States in supporting capacity-building in Southeast Asia under the Singapore-U.S. Third Country Training Program (TCTP). Singapore and the United States have jointly organised 76 capacity building programmes for more than 2,000 officials from ASEAN Member States (AMS), Timor-Leste and the ASEAN Secretariat since the TCTP was established in February 2012. The co-chairs also welcomed the planned expansion of the scope of the TCTP to include the Pacific Islands region and looked forward to the pilot course in March 2024, which would include AMS, Timor-Leste, and members of the Pacific Islands Forum. Both sides expressed continued commitment to the TCTP and collaboration in new areas such as the Smart Cities Program on AI to deepen knowledge sharing in emerging areas.<br/><br/>6. The co-chairs exchanged views on regional and global developments and reiterated the commitment by the United States and Singapore to uphold the rules-based international order. Both sides reaffirmed the position that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and attempts to annex Ukrainian territory are violations of international law and the principles of the UN Charter. The co-chairs condemned the acts of violence and terrorism by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in Israel and reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defence in a manner that complied with international law, including international humanitarian law. Israel should do its utmost to ensure the safety and security of civilians, while Hamas must safely and immediately release all civilian hostages. The co-chairs expressed serious concern about the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and urged all parties to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian supplies in a timely and sustainable manner. Both sides affirmed their shared view that the only viable path to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is through a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.<br/><br/>7. The co-chairs emphasised the importance of reinforcing an open, transparent, inclusive, and ASEAN-centric regional architecture. To this end, Singapore welcomed the commitment to ASEANCentrality by the United States as seen from the upgrade of ASEAN-U.S. Relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2022 and the adoption of the ASEAN-U.S. Summit Leaders' Statement on Cooperation on the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) in September 2023 at the 11th ASEAN-U.S. Summit. The Statement reaffirms shared principles between the AOIP and the United States' Indo-Pacific Strategy, as well as ASEAN and the United States' commitment to tangibly supportimplementationof the four priority areas of the AOIP. Both sides also welcomed the Quad's support for ASEANCentrality, including the Quad's agenda to support Indo-Pacific countries' priorities and needs, andexplored synergies for mutually beneficial cooperation.<br/><br/>8. On Myanmar, the co-chairs reaffirmed ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus and reiterated their calls for the de-escalation of the situation, cessation of violence, and commencement of constructive dialogue among key stakeholders, as well as the need for access to humanitarian assistance. Both sides underscored the role of the United States and ASEAN's other external partners in working with ASEAN to address the crisis and facilitate national reconciliation in Myanmar. On the South China Sea (SCS), the co-chairs underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability, as well as the need to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight as provided under international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Both sides reaffirmed that all concerned partiesmustabide by the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and reiterated support for ASEAN-led efforts to develop an effective and substantive Code of Conduct for the South China Sea that upholds the legitimate rights and interests of all parties and is consistent with UNCLOS.</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Press Statements", "instances": ["S. -Singapore Climate Partnership (USCP) which was launched in August 2021 and updated in June 2023.

For instance, it could be in an area that is expected to be less vulnerable to climate impacts,\" said Prof Xu. </p><p> Other factors play a part too, such as determining suitable locations for power lines to be laid, and each country's rules and regulations on renewable exports.</p><p> For instance, in 2021 and 2022, Malaysia and Indonesia temporarily banned or suspended the export of renewable energy to prioritise their domestic needs.</p><p> Ultimately, the goal would be to help the authorities to determine the most cost-effective way for Singapore to reliably import renewables from the region, Prof Xu added.</p><p> Findings from the study, which started earlier in 2024, will be periodically presented to the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and the National Environment Agency, he said.</p><p> Importing renewables could come at a hefty price. </p><p> Battery storage systems may be needed to supplement renewable power plants to deliver the promised electricity capacity, while subsea cables to transmit the electricity are expensive. </p><p> These are also susceptible to damage as a result of warming oceans, said Prof Xu. </p><p> The study will also look at how Singapore's peak electricity demand could change with the climate, especially with more frequent hotter days and warmer nights -- which are an inevitability, according to V3 predictions, he said. </p><p> For instance, in May 2023, peak electricity demand increased by 8 per cent, from 7.3 gigawatts to 7.9GW. The temperature in Ang Mo Kio hit 37 deg C on May 13 that year -- the hottest on record since 1983.</p><p> In addition, the study will investigate how well Singapore's solar panels will continue to function in hotter weather and increased humidity.</p><p> More than 1GW-peak of solar panels have been installed in Singapore so far, with plans to raise capacity to 2GW-peak by 2030.  </p><p> Temperatures of more than 35 deg C could cause solar panels to overheat and reduce their efficiency, while moisture from humidity could cause the panels to degrade faster, said Prof Xu. </p><p> While this has not occurred thus far, measures can be taken to avoid overheating.</p><p> Mr Melvin Chen, the head of power and renewables consulting for the Asia-Pacific region at Wood MacKenzie, said that in most cases, the developers of the solar projects would have accounted for such performance-related issues in their design and likely would have increased the overall capacity to account for the drop.  </p><p> This would allow them to meet EMA's requirement of operating at 75 per cent load factor for power imports, which refers to the power efficiency of the plant. </p><p> Batteries also play an important role, storing energy during periods when the panels are overperforming and discharging when underperforming, such as on hotter days. </p><p> To mitigate overheating, ground-mounted solar panels and floating solar photovoltaic panels have air cooling, unlike the traditional rooftop solar panels, said Dr Kim Jeong Won from the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute.  </p><p> Using light-coloured and reflective materials can also help to reduce heat absorption, said Dr Kim. </p><p> Likewise, wind turbines may shut down at excessively high wind speeds, and severe storms may damage turbine blades, reducing the turbines' efficiency, she noted. </p><p> Mr Chen said that offshore wind farms today can withstand adverse wind conditions, but there are still design limitations.  </p><p> While there are few documented cases of weather-related damage to offshore wind turbines, more of them have been installed in hurricane-prone regions like the US and Taiwan, and so more studies are needed to understand how extreme weather events could impact them.</p><p> The impact of climate change-induced droughts on hydropower production, however, is most palpable, as seen in China and Europe in 2022. </p><p> Closer to home, droughts in Laos in 2023 raised concerns that hydropower exports to Thailand could be reduced in future, noted Mr Chen. </p><p> Dr Yong Ming-Li, a research fellow in Hawaii's East-West Centre, a think-tank that focuses on the United States, Asia and the Pacific, noted that the Lower Mekong Basin, comprising Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change, and has had a history of drought affecting hydropower production.  </p><p> For instance, the Lower Sesan 2 Dam in Cambodia, which is built on a critical tributary system of the Mekong River and became operational in 2018, has faced trouble in reaching its full generation capacity due to drought, she added.</p><p> Hydropower dams are also contributors to climate change, as the large storage dam reservoirs are a source of methane and carbon dioxide emissions, while cement production to build dams can also be a source of emissions.  </p><p> \"In general, a growing appetite for hydropower from countries like Thailand and Singapore is likely to bolster the Lao government's resolve to become the 'Battery of South-east Asia', and to cement its pathway to doing so through hydropower development,\" said Dr Yong, whose work focuses on hydropower development in the Mekong River Basin.</p><p> For instance, Thailand has been criticised for driving unnecessary demand for Lao hydropower due to its inflated energy demand projections and propensity to over-invest in energy projects. </p><p> Hydropower projects have been criticised for the negative impact on surrounding communities. </p><p> In the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, for example, the combined effects of hydropower development, sand mining and climate change have led to severe drought in 2016, and threatened the agricultural productivity of Vietnam's rice bowl, while affecting fishermen's livelihoods, noted Dr Yong. </p><p>Singapore, as a major importer, could influence greater governance on mitigating the environmental and social impact, such as by mandating more robust environmental impact assessments. But the impact will never be zero, said Mr Chen. </p><p> Dr Yong suggested more concerted coordination among countries in the Mekong River Basin to prioritise the ecological health of the river for rural livelihoods, economic development and nature-based solutions to tackle regional climate change.   </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Singapore, as a major importer, could influence greater governance on mitigating the environmental and social impact, such as by mandating more robust environmental impact assessments.

On the one hand are avoided deforestation projects - which dominate the credit supply of REDD+ projects (the \"+\" indicates that these REDD projects also offer other co-benefits). On the other are carbon removal projects - a much smaller category that includes afforestation, reforestation, wetland restoration, carbon sequestration in agriculture, and improved forest management projects.\u00c2\u00a0The distinction is an important one to make, given that avoidance credits are more vulnerable to quality issues than removal or nature restoration credits, owing to the flaws in REDD architecture described by the Guardian. Avoidance creditsOne reason that avoided deforestation projects are so controversial has to do with how baselines are calculated. The Guardian claimed that Verra-certified REDD+ projects have been using inflated baselines to get credit for more emissions reductions than they deserve. The negative media campaign has since widened, with Dutch publisher Follow The Money alleging that South Pole - a globally recognised climate consultancy - had seriously overestimated the avoided emissions from its flagship Kariba REDD+ project in Zimbabwe, and then failed to notify clients that it had oversold 27 million tonnes of carbon credits to them when the mistake was discovered last year. South Pole has said that the report presented information out of context, but is now reviewing all its REDD+ projects.It is notoriously difficult to reliably predict how much deforestation has been avoided. Political risk, for example, can result in unpredictable local changes that impact baseline deforestation rates, as Verra itself noted. During Jair Bolsonaro's four-year term as president of Brazil, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose by 59.5 per cent from the previous four years, and by 75.5 per cent from the previous decade. To make baselines more responsive to unseen risks, Verra-certified REDD project baselines are now reassessed every six years, instead of every 10 years. Other risks, such as poor land rights governance, local corruption and indigenous rights issues, can also cut across all project types.One particularly tricky problem, even for carbon removal projects, is the question of permanence. In principle, the impact of emissions avoidance or removal should be permanent, and not subject to reversal at the end of a project's life. Given that carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for 1,000 years once it is introduced, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the standard-setter for corporate net-zero pledges, has come under pressure from the carbon removal industry to define \"permanent carbon removal\" as those practices that keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere for at least 1,000 years. This would mean that carbon removal projects would have to anticipate political, climactic, geological changes over 1,000 years, and have suitable insurance or buffer systems in place to pass the permanence test - which many do not currently have.QualityThe wide variability in credit quality is already being reflected in a sharper differentiation between REDD+ credits (which are largely avoidance credits) and nature restoration credits in the VCM. Prices of nature restoration credits hit an all-time high in 2022 and continue to trade at a premium to REDD+ projects in 2023, whereas prices of REDD+ credits fell in 2022, according to data tracked by Trove Research.Yet, it would be simplistic to generalise about the quality of carbon credits by reducing them to project types alone. According to analysis published recently by carbon credit rating firm Sylvera, 31 per cent of REDD+ credits are considered high-quality, scoring strongly across the key metrics of additionality and permanence. Another 29 per cent of REDD+ credits may be overstating their project claims, but only 25 per cent of REDD+ credits are \"effectively junk\", said Sylvera - so the troubles with REDD+ projects may not be as rampant as the media has portrayed. Buyers in the VCM must therefore expect projects under any sub-category to be of mixed quality. They should seek to identify credible project developers that are transparent with project information, and that are able to demonstrate that carbon finance flows back to their projects and participating communities. In the case of South Pole, one carbon credit rating firm has acknowledged that there is evidence to suggest that the developer \"has been trying to act in good faith\". South Pole has voluntarily ceased issuing additional carbon credits to the Kariba project until the real observed deforestation catches up with the previously modelled baseline.Buyers should also consider how shifts in national and international environmental politics might impact the long-term viability of VCM projects. As the market digests the recent clamour concerning major players in the VCM, buyer confidence is as fragile as ever, with nature-based offset prices tumbling to their lowest in more than two years on Feb 2. But despite its flaws, the VCM is still widely recognised to be one of the best tools available to incentivise the conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of ecosystems on a large scale.As the carbon rush pauses to take a sceptical breath, efforts are already ongoing to improve crediting methodologies, while advancements in measurement, reporting and verification technologies are raising the bar for transparency and integrity. These factors, combined with greater public scrutiny, are expected to drive better price discovery in the VCM in 2023, and a gradual flight to quality.Marissa Lee is a senior associate at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["But even as political support to scale up the VCM has grown, similar concerns over credit quality have repeatedly been raised.

Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Albert Chua and United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink met in Singapore on 27 February 2024, to co-chair the 6th United States-Singapore Strategic Partnership Dialogue. Building on the enduring strength of the bilateral strategic partnership, the Dialogue reviewed ongoing areas of cooperation and discussed ways to further advance robust approaches to emerging challenges and mutually beneficial areas, such as in critical and emerging technologies (CET), energy, climate change, and regional capacity building.<br/><br/>2. The co-chairs reaffirmed the strong defence and security partnership underpinned by the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding Regarding United States Use of Facilities in Singapore, the 2005 Strategic Framework Agreement for a Closer Cooperation Partnership in Defence and Security and accompanying 2005 Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA), and the 2015 Enhanced DCA. Both sides benefit from U.S. forces' access to military facilities in Singapore, which supports the United States' presence in and engagement of the region, as well as from the United States' provision of overseas training and technology access to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Our two militaries also participate in overseas operations together, including during the SAF's ongoing deployment for Operation Prosperity Guardian under Combined Task Force 153: Red Sea Maritime Security. The co-chairs reiterated the governments' December 19 joint statement along with over 40 other partners condemning Houthi interference with navigational rights and freedoms in the waters around the Arabian Peninsula, particularly the Red Sea. The co-chairs welcomed the recent signing of the Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) between the U.S. Department of Defense and Singapore Ministry of Defence in December 2023 that would enable both sides to better address unanticipated supply chain disruptions that could affect defence needs. They also lauded the recently held 7th Law Enforcement and Homeland Security and Safety Cooperation Dialogue, which focused on the growing threat of cybercrime and online scams as well as a wide range of law enforcement and homeland security issues. They noted the continued progress of the bilateral Cyber Dialogue, which was now in its third year.<br/><br/>3. The co-chairs welcomed the 20th Anniversary of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) this year. The USSFTA, which has been in force since 2004, is a linchpin in the bilateral economic relationship and testament to the strong economic and business ties between the two countries. The co-chairs also took stock of progress under the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation (PGI), launched by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong in October 2021, and looked forward to further cooperation under this initiative. The PGI aims to strengthen trade and investment collaboration between the two economies in new and forward-looking areas, as reflected in joint statements released following the PGI annual dialogues in October 2022 and June 2023. In addition, the co-chairs noted the close cooperation between Singapore and the United States on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). Both sides welcomed the significant outcomes announced to date, which will support the continued and constructive economic engagement among the United States, Singapore, and other IPEF partners in the region and provide a firm foundation to further deepen regional cooperation. They include the entry into force of the Supply Chain Agreement on 24 February 2024, and the substantial conclusion of negotiations on the Clean Economy and Fair Economy Agreements, as well as the Agreement on IPEF. Both sides looked forward to continuing to work closely together to implement these Agreements to deliver concrete benefits to all the IPEF partners.<br/><br/>4. The co-chairs discussed emerging areas of cooperation in areas such as CET, climate change, and energy. Both sides welcomed the launch of the inaugural U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue in October 2023 and looked forward to greater collaboration in artificial intelligence (AI), digital economy and data governance, biotechnology, critical infrastructure and technology supply chains, defence innovation, as well as quantum information science and technology. Both sides also discussed progress on the U.S.-Singapore Climate Partnership (USCP) which was launched in August 2021 and updated in June 2023. Notable progress has been made on regional energy transition, low- and zero-emission technologies and solutions, nature-based solutions and carbon markets workstreams and capacity building. On energy, the co-chairs underscored their support for ASEAN's clean energy transition and the realisation of the ASEAN Power Grid. The co-chairs also discussed partnership on civil nuclear energy cooperation to support Singapore's capability building in nuclear safety, security, nonproliferation, and understanding of advanced civil nuclear energy technologies, as part of Singapore's efforts to study all potential pathways for decarbonisation.<br/><br/>5. The co-chairs re-affirmed the close collaboration between Singapore and the United States in supporting capacity-building in Southeast Asia under the Singapore-U.S. Third Country Training Program (TCTP). Singapore and the United States have jointly organised 76 capacity building programmes for more than 2,000 officials from ASEAN Member States (AMS), Timor-Leste and the ASEAN Secretariat since the TCTP was established in February 2012. The co-chairs also welcomed the planned expansion of the scope of the TCTP to include the Pacific Islands region and looked forward to the pilot course in March 2024, which would include AMS, Timor-Leste, and members of the Pacific Islands Forum. Both sides expressed continued commitment to the TCTP and collaboration in new areas such as the Smart Cities Program on AI to deepen knowledge sharing in emerging areas.<br/><br/>6. The co-chairs exchanged views on regional and global developments and reiterated the commitment by the United States and Singapore to uphold the rules-based international order. Both sides reaffirmed the position that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and attempts to annex Ukrainian territory are violations of international law and the principles of the UN Charter. The co-chairs condemned the acts of violence and terrorism by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in Israel and reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defence in a manner that complied with international law, including international humanitarian law. Israel should do its utmost to ensure the safety and security of civilians, while Hamas must safely and immediately release all civilian hostages. The co-chairs expressed serious concern about the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and urged all parties to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian supplies in a timely and sustainable manner. Both sides affirmed their shared view that the only viable path to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is through a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.<br/><br/>7. The co-chairs emphasised the importance of reinforcing an open, transparent, inclusive, and ASEAN-centric regional architecture. To this end, Singapore welcomed the commitment to ASEAN Centrality by the United States as seen from the upgrade of ASEAN-U.S. Relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2022 and the adoption of the ASEAN-U.S. Summit Leaders' Statement on Cooperation on the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) in September 2023 at the 11th ASEAN-U.S. Summit. The Statement reaffirms shared principles between the AOIP and the United States' Indo-Pacific Strategy, as well as ASEAN and the United States' commitment to tangibly support implementation of the four priority areas of the AOIP. Both sides also welcomed the Quad's support for ASEAN Centrality, including the Quad's agenda to support Indo-Pacific countries' priorities and needs, and explored synergies for mutually beneficial cooperation.<br/><br/>8. On Myanmar, the co-chairs reaffirmed ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus and reiterated their calls for the de-escalation of the situation, cessation of violence, and commencement of constructive dialogue among key stakeholders, as well as the need for access to humanitarian assistance. Both sides underscored the role of the United States and ASEAN's other external partners in working with ASEAN to address the crisis and facilitate national reconciliation in Myanmar. On the South China Sea (SCS), the co-chairs underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability, as well as the need to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight as provided under international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Both sides reaffirmed that all concerned parties mustabide by the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and reiterated support for ASEAN-led efforts to develop an effective and substantive Code of Conduct for the South China Sea that upholds the legitimate rights and interests of all parties and is consistent with UNCLOS.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp; Defense, Professional Services, Partnerships and Alliances, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["S. -Singapore Climate Partnership (USCP) which was launched in August 2021 and updated in June 2023.

This was revealed by National Development Minister Desmond Lee on Tuesday (Nov 28), along with details on other potential features of the decades-long project. Mr Lee was speaking to attendees including the media and stakeholders at a habitat enhancement event at East Coast Park. The project was first raised by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the National Day Rally in 2019, and was showcased at an exhibition last year by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. </p><p>Providing an update on Tuesday, Mr Desmond Lee said that the project will involve reclaiming three new tracts of land at a higher level, and away from the current coastline. This will \"project coastal protection seawards\", allowing for the existing East Coast Park to largely be retained as it is, he added. The reclaimed land will measure about 800ha, or twice the size of Marina Bay. It will also create a new freshwater reservoir, which the public may use for water activities such as canoeing and dragon-boating. Other features include two tidal gates and pumping stations to \"keep the sea out\", and to pump out rainwater when heavy rain coincides with high tide. Such measures are necessary because rising sea levels pose an \"existential threat\" to low-lying Singapore, Mr Desmond Lee added. The project will also add around 20km of new coastal and reservoir parks, extending from the current East Coast Park. This will triple the length of the existing waterfront area along the park. Expected to take \"decades\" to implement, the planning for Long Island must begin now, so that it \"can be realised in time to protect the area from rising sea levels\", Mr Desmond Lee said. This includes conducting extensive environmental and engineering studies - to assess the feasibility of the \"conceptual reclamation profile\" - which will take about five years, while a public consultation is also held concurrently. WHY IT MATTERS As a low-lying island state, Singapore must contend with rising sea levels and the long-term impact of climate change, Mr Desmond Lee said. Mean sea levels around Singapore are projected to rise by up to 1m by the end of the century. When high tides coincide with storm surges, sea levels could rise by up to 4m to 5m above mean sea level, he added. \"This is a very serious problem, because around one-third of our island is under 5m above mean sea level, and at risk of being inundated by the sea.\" In particular, the East Coast area faces a high risk of flooding since it is low-lying, and parts of East Coast Park were flooded for around two hours in January this year, he noted. Therefore, coastal protection measures are needed to protect homes and livelihoods in the area. Although protecting low-lying areas is important, the public had expressed the desire to retain unimpeded access to the waterfront, and for heritage and recreation spaces along the coast to be preserved, Mr Desmond Lee said. This feedback was taken onboard in developing the latest concept for Long Island, he added. An alternative to Long Island that had been considered was a \"Long Wall\" - or a continuous seawall built along the entire East Coast waterfront, from Marina East to Tanah Merah. It would measure up to 3m in height. To provide coastal defence for that stretch of coastline, 12 tidal gates and pumping stations - instead of the two anticipated for Long Island - would also have to be built along each of the existing outlet drains at the park. Such an option, while possible, is \"not ideal\" for the area, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said. Doing so would mean large stretches of the park would have to be closed during the seawall's construction. Even after the construction is completed, the seawall would permanently limit park users' access to the waterfront for recreation and sports. The 12 tidal gates and pumping stations would take up significant space as well - around the size of 15 football fields - which would mean forfeiting existing greenery and recreational facilities at the park. \"In essence, this approach means that we implement coastal protection along the existing East Coast Park, but lose significant portions of the park and recreational use of the coastline,\" Mr Lee said. Long Island would thus be a \"more optimal solution\" because it integrates coastal protection measures with future reclamation plans for the area, he added. WHAT'S NEXT Long Island's planning and implementation will take decades, beginning with technical studies that will take about five years, and a public consultation, Mr Desmond Lee said. For a start, the Government will embark on \"extensive environmental and engineering studies\" to assess if the conceptual reclamation profile is feasible. It will also begin to \"formulate innovative and cost-effective nature-based solutions to reclaim and develop Long Island\", he added. Concurrently, the authorities will engage residents and stakeholders - including businesses, the nature and heritage community, sports and recreational interest groups, and more - on their feedback and ideas for the reclaimed stretch. After the technical studies are completed, the authorities will engage the public on Long Island's \"design and masterplanning\". Ultimately, Long Island will hold \"tremendous opportunities and possibilities for Singaporeans to come together, and lead the way in showing what can be done, and what can be possible in dealing with climate change and rising sea levels\", the minister said. \"As we protect our homes, our infrastructure, our livelihoods, and our cherished East Coast Park, we will collectively create new opportunities for quality living and recreation, for the benefit of Singaporeans today and for our future generations.\" To find out more about Long Island, visit go.gov.sg/Long-Island.</p>", "publisher": "Today (Singapore) - Online", "instances": ["WHAT'S NEXT Long Island's planning and implementation will take decades, beginning with technical studies that will take about five years, and a public consultation, Mr Desmond Lee said.

The spokesperson said that the stance is aimed at addressing the risk of \"carbon leakage\", which occurs when deforestation is simply \"moved\" from within a project to an area that is unmonitored. Leakage is of particular concern in countries with historically significant levels of deforestation, and in the class of conservation credits known as Redd+. Redd+ stands for \"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation\".Singapore is preparing to release by year's end a list of eligible host countries, programmes and methodologies under its International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, which will allow companies to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions beginning in 2024. This comes after the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the National Environment Agency (NEA) published the eligibility criteria underpinning the coming list.Jurisdictional Redd+Redd+ projects have come under intense scrutiny amid heightened scepticism about the integrity of their emissions reduction claims.Responding to BT's queries, the government spokesperson said Singapore recognises the need to support the management and conservation of existing forests, and to restoring deforested areas.Therefore, \"we will accept Redd+ projects that adopt a jurisdictional approach in countries with historically significant levels of deforestation\", he said.\u00c2\u00a0These include projects developed using the jurisdictional and nested Redd+ (JNR) framework of the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).JNR projects are seen to avoid some of the criticisms that have plagued the project-level Redd+ methodology. </p><p>Project-level Redd+ credits have bore the brunt of criticisms about inflated baselines and over-crediting, but JNR projects are seen to be subjected to stricter oversight.This position is aligned with the eligibility criteria set by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), which is regarded as one of the most rigorous and reputable international standards, the spokesperson explained.Environmental integrity The government is unlikely to include \"high forest, low deforestation\" (HFLD) credits in the initial version of the eligibility list.The spokesperson said these credits are still new, and will require further assessment for environmental integrity.HFLD credits have been mooted for heavily forested areas with historically low rates of deforestation, on the basis that it is important to protect these areas early on. But whether the avoided emissions from such projects are truly additional to business as usual has been a subject of debate.The Singapore government's stance is to monitor developments and international discourse around these credits, explore working with HFLD jurisdictions to refine HFLD methodologies, and come up with mechanisms that offer incentives to promote conservation, the spokesperson said.Coal phase-out credits\"Transition credits\", recently proposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a way to credit the avoided emissions when coal-fired power plants are retired early, are also unlikely to be on the eligibility list because they are still too nascent.The same applies to carbon-capture credits tied to oil extraction processes, and direct air capture credits.The spokesperson said: \"We are unable to make an assessment on these activities, as there are no crediting methodologies meeting Article 6 requirements that have been published as of now.\"However, he said Singapore recognises the importance of developing the carbon market and the rules governing it, to facilitate international cooperation in this market. The government will review the credibility of these methodologies when they become available and assess whether they meet Singapore's criteria.Reversal protectionAccepted projects should have mechanisms to monitor, mitigate and compensate for the possibility of \"reversals\", which occur when a credit can no longer support claims for the amount of emissions it reduces or removes, the spokesperson said. For instance, a wildfire in a forest conservation site releases carbon that had previously been stored in the area, and might require a reversal. However, projects that might face a risk of reversals might be required to maintain a \"buffer\" pool of credits to insure against reversals.If there are serious concerns about the environmental integrity of any ICC project, NEA, as administrator for the carbon tax regime, may remove these projects from the eligibility list, the spokesperson said.In terms of the scope of Singapore's carbon tax, the spokesperson said there are no plans at the moment to lower the taxable threshold of 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year. Facilities that emit above that level are subject to Singapore's carbon tax.The spokesperson explained that Singapore's carbon tax coverage is already \"one of the highest in the world\". More than 90 per cent of Singapore emissions are already subjected to a carbon price. Carbon tax covers about 80 per cent of emissions; the rest is covered through excise duties that offer incentives to lower transport emissions, he noted.At this level of coverage, the carbon tax is imposed at key nodes, and flows through the rest of the economy. This, in turn, reduces the administrative load on small emitters - especially small and medium-sized enterprises - to measure, report and verify their emissions, he added.Supply and demandThe spokesperson said it is not possible to forecast the projected supply of ICCs because Singapore is still negotiating implementation agreements with about a dozen countries, with varying levels of progress in each.These implementation agreements are being drawn up to ensure that the credits are not double-counted in two countries' nationally determined contributions when credit trades take place. Singapore has set these agreements as a prerequisite for credits that can be accepted under its ICC framework.Also, commercial sensitivities may make project developers choose not to disclose what they are planning in the potential host countries. This prevents \"meaningful forecasting\", the spokesperson said.Nevertheless, Vietnam and Ghana - the countries with which Singapore is closest to signing implementation agreements - seem to have taken commercial interest in developing projects in the areas of landfill methane capture, efficient household appliances, renewable energy, and nature-based solutions, the spokesperson said.In any case, the market demand for ICCs is expected to be slow at the start, he noted. \"As the option to use ICCs to offset carbon tax is new, we expect that companies will need time to build up the requisite knowledge and capabilities to avail themselves of this option,\" the spokesperson said.Market observers have told BT that ICCs are expected to command a price premium over voluntary credits that do not come with corresponding adjustments. The spokesperson agreed with these higher costs, on the back of the need for host-country authorisation and higher environment integrity. Prices will, however, be determined by market dynamics, the spokesperson added.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Also, commercial sensitivities may make project developers choose not to disclose what they are planning in the potential host countries.

Unlike past reports issued by global bodies like the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that also warned about climate effects, the latest report from Singapore bears greater scrutiny as it is a deeper dive into how the country's weather will become more extreme in the coming years. The findings include predictions on specific shifts in temperature, sea level rise, rainfall and wind by the end of the century and beyond, based off a more \"accurate simulation\" of regional climate changes on a finer scale, said the agencies behind the report. Should global emissions almost double by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, for example, Singapore's average temperatures could shoot up by 0.55\u00b0C per decade, among other possible impacts. This would be a faster pace of increase than the 0.24\u00b0C per decade observed in the past 40 years, according to Singapore's third national climate change study, also known as V3.

Three governmental bodies including the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) said in a joint press release on Friday that the latest study was based on several global climate models taken from the sixth assessment report published last March by the IPCC. </p><p>The bodies said that these findings will be taken into account by the Government in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure the country remains climate resilient. Experts told TODAY that the findings were concerning, with possible impacts on physical health and infrastructure, among other things. Read on as TODAY delves into V3's findings, why people living here should be concerned and what actions the authorities here are taking in light of the findings. HOW FINDINGS WERE CUSTOMISED TO SINGAPORE In exploring the possible range of outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by the year 2100, V3's projections are: A low-emissions scenario where net zero targets are achieved globally after 2050 and temperatures rise by 1.8\u00b0C by end-century A middle-of-the-road scenario where emissions hover around current levels before they start to decline by 2050 and temperatures rise by 2.7\u00b0C by end-century A high-emissions scenario where emissions almost double by 2050 and temperatures rise by 4.4\u00b0C by end-century It does not offer IPCC's best-case scenario, where net zero targets are achieved globally by 2050 to meet the Paris Agreement goal, and temperatures rise by 1.5\u00b0C. V3's study selected six global climate models and downscaled them. Then, taking a modelling system used here to generate weather forecasts, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore created a customised modelling system to run its studies. Through this customised system, the scenarios are then simulated based on an 8km domain for the region, and a 2km domain for Singapore. This means that the V3 study had a much clearer projection over a larger area than the V2 study in 2015, and it is also more accurate. WHY SHOULD YOU CARE? Experts told TODAY that the V3 report findings are a stark reminder that Singapore and the world need to act swiftly to reduce carbon emissions and act on climate change. Associate Professor Jason Lee from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS) said that the most concerning part was the report's findings that hotter days and nights were on the horizon in all three scenarios. \"We'd better be alarmed and this alarm should trigger a sense of urgency to take actions at all levels proactively and not reactively,\" he said. \"(More warm nights) means that we will reach a point in time that we will progressively feel the heat even while resting without no cooling aids.\" Professor Winston Chow of Singapore Management University whose research is on urban climate said that the warm nights could lead to health problems as people get poor sleep, and it could also start a vicious circle of producing more emissions as people use air-conditioners more often. With more periods of dry spells and rainy days predicted based on V3's findings, the extreme weather may also affect biodiversity. Prof Chow, who is also the co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, said: \"With more extremes of rainfall and heat, the question is whether existing biodiversity can adapt. \"Some (species) can adapt better than others, such as mosquitoes that are likely to thrive in such conditions. \"But our trees that are used to tropical habitats might not be used to more episodes of dry spells.\" Singapore relies on nature-based solutions to regulate temperatures - such as trees to mitigate urban heat and green walls to reduce buildings' absorption of heat - so the extreme weather could negate the effect of these green spaces, Prof Chow added. The rising temperatures will not just be uncomfortable, it will also bring about more pressure on the country's healthcare system. Assistant Professor Borame L Dickens from the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said that the increased extreme and frequent heatwaves will worsen heat stress on human bodies. Asst Prof Dickens said: \"Vulnerable groups - especially children, the elderly and those who are suffering from chronic conditions or diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity - will be especially susceptible to having complications because of these heatwaves.\" This could add strain to healthcare demands, with more hospital admissions for people who have existing cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. \"Mental health conditions are also made worse because of distress resulting from the heat, which can compromise decision-making, leading to more accidents, more incidents of aggression and even suicides,\" Assoc Prof Lee added. Rising sea levels and higher temperatures could also affect crucial infrastructure such as Changi Airport and Tuas port, Prof Chow said. HOW HOT WILL IT BE, WHAT CHANGES LIE AHEAD 1. TEMPERATURE Currently, Singapore's average daily mean temperature is 27.9\u00b0C. In all of V3's three projected scenarios, the average daily mean temperature and the Wet Bulb Global Temperature (WBGT) will increase by end-century. WBGT is heat stress in direct sunlight, taking into account other environmental factors such as humidity, wind speed and cloud cover. For now, it is 26.6\u00b0C. In the best-case scenario, the average mean daily temperature would rise between 0.6\u00b0C and 1.6\u00b0C, while WBGT would increase by 0.5\u00b0C to 1.4\u00b0C In the worst-case scenario, the average mean daily temperature would go up by 2.8\u00b0C to 5.0\u00b0C, while WBGT would go up by 2.5\u00b0C to 4.3\u00b0C This means that WBGT would be around 30\u00b0C on average daily by end-century. With WBGT at 33\u00b0C or higher, the risk of heat stress and related illnesses such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke will be higher. And should emissions increase rapidly, there could be between 207 and 326 of such high heat stress days yearly by end-century. V3's study threw up possible scenarios and one is that there may be more warm nights of between 312 and 316 days in the best scenario - or warm nights all year round at the worst. Warm nights are when daily minimum temperatures equal or exceed 26.3\u00b0C. 2. RAINFALL Singapore will see much more rainfall during rainy monsoon seasons. By 2100, rainfall during the December-January period will increase by up to 58 per cent in the best scenario, and by up to 44 per cent in the worst scenario. The dry months from June to September will also be hotter, with a 10 per cent drop in rainfall in the best case, and a 42 per cent decline in the worst case. The study also found that in the worst-case scenario, there will be one dry spell of up to around 21 days for every 10 months. Dry spells are periods of at least 15 consecutive days where the island-wide average of rainfall is less than 1.0mm on each day. 3. WINDS Overall, the study predicted wind speeds to increase by up to around 6 to 20 per cent during the northeast monsoon and southwest monsoon seasons in each projected scenario. The inter-monsoon months of April and May will see an increase in wind speeds of up to 6 to 11 per cent by the end of the century. Daily maximum wind gusts are expected to increase by up to 10 per cent come 2100, which can potentially cause damage to Singapore's infrastructure and uproot trees. 4. SEA LEVELS In all projected scenarios, the sea levels will rise. In V3's study, there is better research than V2's study in 2015 into the melting Antarctic ice sheets and their contribution to global sea levels. In the best case, Singapore's mean sea level will go up between 0.23m and 0.74m In the worst case, the mean sea level will rise by 0.54m to 1.15m By 2150, sea levels here could rise by 1.37m in the worst-case scenario. About a third of Singapore's land area is less than 5m above mean sea level, so a 1m increase in sea levels could result in several plots of land being lost if nothing is done. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO MANAGE PROJECTED CHANGES? In Friday's joint press release, MSE, MSS and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that Singapore's future climate depends on all countries acting collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. MSS will be sharing the data from V3 with member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) \"at a later stage\". MSS will also be collaborating with international entities and the scientific community to undertake joint research using V3's data. Beyond research, the Government \"takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change\", the three governmental bodies said. \"The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate-resilient.\" Some key things that the Government would be doing include reviewing building codes to ensure the structural integrity of infrastructure, as well as climate-proofing network infrastructure such as transport, telecommunications and energy in the face of projected higher temperatures and wind speeds, for instance. There are plans to cool urban spaces in more ways, by using modelling in district and estate planning to preserve wind corridors, and deploying cool paint to reduce heat absorption, for example. The Government already announced plans for the \"Long Island\" reclamation project off the country's eastern coast in 2019 to \"project coastal projection seawards\". \"Government action alone will not be sufficient. Everyone - individuals, communities and corporates - has a role to play to promote sustainability and mitigate climate change,\" MSE, NEA and MSS said. Some things that individuals can do include saving electricity by adopting energy-efficient appliances, reducing water usage and buying domestic produce that has a lower carbon footprint.</p>", "publisher": "Today (Singapore) - Online", "instances": ["\"Some (species) can adapt better than others, such as mosquitoes that are likely to thrive in such conditions. \"But our trees that are used to tropical habitats might not be used to more episodes of dry spells.

Redd+ stands for \"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore is preparing to release by year's end a list of eligible host countries, programmes and methodologies under its International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, which will allow companies to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions beginning in 2024. </p><p> This comes after the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the National Environment Agency (NEA) published the eligibility criteria underpinning the coming list.</p><p> Jurisdictional Redd+Redd+ projects have come under intense scrutiny amid heightened scepticism about the integrity of their emissions reduction claims.</p><p> Responding to BT's queries, the government spokesperson said Singapore recognises the need to support the management and conservation of existing forests, and to restoring deforested areas.</p><p> Therefore, \"we will accept Redd+ projects that adopt a jurisdictional approach in countries with historically significant levels of deforestation\", he said. These include projects developed using the jurisdictional and nested Redd+ (JNR) framework of the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).</p><p> JNR projects are seen to avoid some of the criticisms that have plagued the project-level Redd+ methodology. </p><p> Project-level Redd+ credits have bore the brunt of criticisms about inflated baselines and over-crediting, but JNR projects are seen to be subjected to stricter oversight.</p><p> This position is aligned with the eligibility criteria set by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), which is regarded as one of the most rigorous and reputable international standards, the spokesperson explained.</p><p> Environmental integrity The government is unlikely to include \"high forest, low deforestation\" (HFLD) credits in the initial version of the eligibility list.</p><p> The spokesperson said these credits are still new, and will require further assessment for environmental integrity.</p><p> HFLD credits have been mooted for heavily forested areas with historically low rates of deforestation, on the basis that it is important to protect these areas early on. But whether the avoided emissions from such projects are truly additional to business as usual has been a subject of debate.</p><p> The Singapore government's stance is to monitor developments and international discourse around these credits, explore working with HFLD jurisdictions to refine HFLD methodologies, and come up with mechanisms that offer incentives to promote conservation, the spokesperson said.</p><p> Coal phase-out credits\"Transition credits\", recently proposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a way to credit the avoided emissions when coal-fired power plants are retired early, are also unlikely to be on the eligibility list because they are still too nascent. The same applies to carbon-capture credits tied to oil extraction processes, and direct air capture credits.</p><p> The spokesperson said: \"We are unable to make an assessment on these activities, as there are no crediting methodologies meeting Article 6 requirements that have been published as of now.\"</p><p> However, he said Singapore recognises the importance of developing the carbon market and the rules governing it, to facilitate international cooperation in this market. The government will review the credibility of these methodologies when they become available and assess whether they meet Singapore's criteria.</p><p> Reversal protectionAccepted projects should have mechanisms to monitor, mitigate and compensate for the possibility of \"reversals\", which occur when a credit can no longer support claims for the amount of emissions it reduces or removes, the spokesperson said. </p><p> For instance, a wildfire in a forest conservation site releases carbon that had previously been stored in the area, and might require a reversal. However, projects that might face a risk of reversals might be required to maintain a \"buffer\" pool of credits to insure against reversals.</p><p> If there are serious concerns about the environmental integrity of any ICC project, NEA, as administrator for the carbon tax regime, may remove these projects from the eligibility list, the spokesperson said.</p><p> In terms of the scope of Singapore's carbon tax, the spokesperson said there are no plans at the moment to lower the taxable threshold of 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year. Facilities that emit above that level are subject to Singapore's carbon tax.</p><p> The spokesperson explained that Singapore's carbon tax coverage is already \"one of the highest in the world\". More than 90 per cent of Singapore emissions are already subjected to a carbon price. </p><p> Carbon tax covers about 80 per cent of emissions; the rest is covered through excise duties that offer incentives to lower transport emissions, he noted.</p><p> At this level of coverage, the carbon tax is imposed at key nodes, and flows through the rest of the economy. This, in turn, reduces the administrative load on small emitters -- especially small and medium-sized enterprises -- to measure, report and verify their emissions, he added.</p><p> Supply and demandThe spokesperson said it is not possible to forecast the projected supply of ICCs because Singapore is still negotiating implementation agreements with about a dozen countries, with varying levels of progress in each.</p><p> These implementation agreements are being drawn up to ensure that the credits are not double-counted in two countries' nationally determined contributions when credit trades take place. Singapore has set these agreements as a prerequisite for credits that can be accepted under its ICC framework.</p><p> Also, commercial sensitivities may make project developers choose not to disclose what they are planning in the potential host countries. This prevents \"meaningful forecasting\", the spokesperson said.</p><p> Nevertheless, Vietnam and Ghana -- the countries with which Singapore is closest to signing implementation agreements -- seem to have taken commercial interest in developing projects in the areas of landfill methane capture, efficient household appliances, renewable energy, and nature-based solutions, the spokesperson said.</p><p> In any case, the market demand for ICCs is expected to be slow at the start, he noted. \"As the option to use ICCs to offset carbon tax is new, we expect that companies will need time to build up the requisite knowledge and capabilities to avail themselves of this option,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p> Market observers have told BT that ICCs are expected to command a price premium over voluntary credits that do not come with corresponding adjustments. </p><p> The spokesperson agreed with these higher costs, on the back of the need for host-country authorisation and higher environment integrity.

Good morning everyone. I am glad to be here today, to join grassroot leaders, colleagues, and stakeholders to plant coastal trees to enhance East Coast Park.<br/><br/>2. For those of us who are old enough to remember, the land we are currently on used to be the sea. Land was reclaimed from the sea, from here all the way to Marine Parade Road.</p><p><br/><br/>3. This was called the \"Great Reclamation\": it was an ambitious reclamation project along the south-eastern coast of Singapore that our pioneer leaders embarked on, shortly after our independence. Full-scale reclamation work started in 1966, and over twenty years, we gradually added over 1,500 hectares of land, equivalent to 2,100 football fields, stretching from Tanah Merah Besar all the way to Telok Ayer Basin. Now this created additional space for Singapore, to build schools and homes, and to create job opportunities.<br/><br/>4. Our pioneers also envisioned that this reclaimed segment would be, \"a principal recreational lung for the whole island\". East Coast Park was opened in the 1970s on this reclaimed land, and we have gradually added new recreational facilities and green spaces over the subsequent years and decades.<br/><br/>5. We will continue to improve East Coast Park. For example, my NParks colleagues will create a 15 km nature trail along East Coast Park over the next eight years. The trail will connect existing and upcoming recreational and green spaces in the park, and bring you closer to greenery and to nature. Our tree planting efforts later this morning will contribute to this new nature trail.<br/><br/>Coastal Protection at East Coast<br/><br/>6. Let me now speak a little bit about coastal protection here at East Coast. When our pioneers embarked on the reclamation of East Coast more than 50 years ago, they were not only addressing immediate and pressing challenges that Singapore faced at that time. They were looking very far ahead, imagining what the future might look like, and creating space and opportunity for future generations of Singaporeans.<br/><br/>7. We must continue this discipline of long-term planning. Thinking about future generations, and not just about ourselves.<br/><br/>8. One major area of work for us, is preparing for the long-term impact of climate change. As a low-lying island state, rising sea levels poses an existential threat to Singapore. Mean sea levels around Singapore are projected to rise by up to 1 metre by the end of this century. When high tides coincide with storm surges, sea levels could rise by up to 4 to 5 metres above mean sea level (AMSL). This is a very serious problem, because around one-third of our island is below 5 metres above mean sea level, and at risk of being inundated by the sea. While it may seem quite distant from today, we have to start planning and preparing now.<br/><br/>9. The East Coast of Singapore is low-lying and faces a high risk of flooding. We have already experienced flooding along this stretch. In January this year, some parts of East Coast Park were flooded for around two hours.<br/><br/>10. We need to put in measures to protect our homes and livelihoods in this area, and have been studying various coastal protection measures and options.<br/><br/>11. One possible measure is to build a sea wall along the entire coastline from the City to East Coast. You can call it a \"Long Wall\" approach.<br/><br/>12. Under this option, we will need to build a continuous sea wall that is up to 3m in height along the entire waterfront of East Coast Park, from Marina East to Tanah Merah. We will also have to build 12 tidal gates and pumping stations along each of the existing outlet drains along East Coast Park to keep the sea out and to pump rainwater out, when heavy rain coincides with high tide. Many of you would have seen the tidal gate and pumping station at the Marina Barrage which serves this same function. So imagine a smaller version of this tidal gate and pumping station, and having 12 of these along East Coast Park to provide coastal defence for the entire stretch of coastline.<br/><br/>13. This option is technically feasible, but it is really not ideal for East Coast Park. This is because, we will need to close off large stretches of East Coast Park from the public when constructing the sea wall and the tidal gate. After construction is complete, the sea wall will permanently limit park users' access to the waterfront for recreation and sports. The 12 tidal gates and pumping stations will also take up a lot of space within East Coast Park, around the size of 15 football fields. So you can imagine if we adopt this \"Long Wall\" approach, a lot of existing greenery and recreational facilities must go. In essence, this approach means we implement coastal protection along the existing East Coast Park, but lose significant portions of the park and recreational use of the coastline.<br/><br/>Long Island<br/><br/>14. A more optimal solution that we have been studying is: to integrate coastal protection measures with our future reclamation plans for the area. This idea of \"Long Island\" was raised by Prime Minister during the National Day Rally in 2019, and showcased at URA's Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) exhibition in 2022.<br/><br/>15. We received a lot of feedback and suggestions on the \"Long Island\" concept, during the Long-Term Plan Review, as well as PUB's \"Our Coastal Conversations\". For instance, while people recognised the vital importance of protecting low lying areas, they wanted to retain unimpeded access to the waterfront. The area also holds fond memories for many Singaporeans, and many hoped that we could preserve the heritage and recreational spaces along our coast.<br/><br/>16. We have taken many of these pieces of feedback onboard. So let me take this opportunity to update you on the latest concept, the latest thinking, behind \"Long Island\": The concept of \"Long Island\" is to project coastal protection seawards, by reclaiming three new tracts of land, at a higher level, away from the current coastline. This will allow us to retain the existing East Coast Park, largely as it is. It will also create an enclosed waterbody, preserving the waterfront character of the original East Coast Park. Over time, the waterbody will become a freshwater reservoir, which the public can use for water activities such as canoeing and dragon-boating. The reservoir will also add to our water supply. There will be two large tidal gates and pumping stations on the reclaimed \"Long Island\", as compared to twelve smaller ones along East Coast Park in the other option that I spoke about earlier. These tidal gates and pumping stations will also be much further away from existing residential and recreational spaces. Here is an artist's impression of how \"Long Island\" might look like from the existing East Coast Park.<br/><br/>17. While we are still working out the details, the reclaimed \"Long Island\" may potentially be around 800 ha, about twice the size of Marina Bay. This creates opportunities for future generations of Singaporeans. They could build homes, create jobs, develop services and amenities that they need, and add around 20 km of new coastal and reservoir parks, extending from the current East Coast Park. This would triple the length of the existing waterfront area along East Coast Park today.<br/><br/>18. Let me show you an artist impression of what \"Long Island\" could potentially look like when it is finally completed.<br/><br/>19. So, in essence, \"Long Island\" will help us to achieve a number of objectives: (a) primarily, protect us from rising sea-levels, (b) second, preserve the existing East Coast Park for park users, (c) third, enhance our water resilience, (d) fourth, develop more waterfront for outdoor recreation, and (e) fifth, create land optionality and opportunity for future generations of Singaporeans.<br/><br/>Technical Studies and Public Engagement<br/><br/>20. Because \"Long Island\" is a very major undertaking, the planning and implementation will take decades. We are still at a very early stage in this journey. The pictures you have seen are just artist impressions, examples of what might be possible. The final shape and form of \"Long Island\" will evolve over time, and we must wait for the studies to be undertaken. As a start, we will need to kickstart extensive environmental and engineering studies to see if the conceptual reclamation profile is feasible, and formulate innovative and cost-effective nature-based solutions to reclaim and develop \"Long Island\". We expect the studies to take around five years. These studies will need to begin now, so that \"Long Island\" can be realised in time to protect the area from rising sea levels.<br/><br/>21. In parallel, we will also be engaging residents and stakeholders, and collecting more feedback and ideas from Singaporeans. We want to hear from as many of you as possible - the general public, residents, businesses in the local area, the nature and heritage community, sports and recreational interest groups and many more. Join us to explore the possibilities. When we complete the technical studies, we will also engage you on the design and masterplanning for \"Long Island\".<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>22. In closing, \"Long Island\" holds tremendous opportunities and possibilities for Singaporeans to come together, and lead the way in showing what can be done and what be possible in dealing with climate change and rising sea levels.<br/><br/>23. As we protect our homes, infrastructure, livelihoods, and our cherished East Coast Park, we will collectively create new opportunities for quality living and recreation, for the benefit of Singaporeans today and for our future generations.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp; Defense, Financial/ Capital Market, Investment Banking &amp; Brokerage, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["The pictures you have seen are just artist impressions, examples of what might be possible.

We are indeed very honoured this morning to welcome Madam President as our Guest-of-Honour again. She has been a very strong supporter of the Festival of Biodiversity and the work that many of our partners do on the ground, nurturing our City in Nature. I would like to thank Madam for taking the time to join us in celebrating our native biodiversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A big thank you as well, to the members of the Biodiversity Roundtable and our partners from the nature community, teachers and students, for your support and hard work, in organising and contributing to the Festival of Biodiversity for the tenth year running.

We hold this Festival every year in celebration of the rich biodiversity that we share our island with, and in recognition of our responsibility, as stewards of our environment, to take good care of this natural heritage for future generations.</p><p>But as a small city state, we face many challenges in doing so. Our land constraints mean we must carefully balance our developmental needs with nature conservation. And we also face the pressing concern of climate change, which is an existential threat for us - and our biodiversity. That is why we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 to pursue sustainable development, and to do our part to combat climate change.</p><p>One of the key pillars of the Green Plan is to transform Singapore into a City in Nature. Given our limited land that is both a city and a country, we don't have the luxury of large areas outside our city where we can conserve nature.</p><p>For us, nature is within, nature is all around, and nature is part of the city, not outside. Hence, we are weaving nature much more closely as part of the fabric of our city. So that City and Nature not only co-exist but can also form a symbiotic relationship</p><p>Today, I'd like to share a bit more about what we're doing to achieve this vision: how we're using more nature-based solutions to strengthen our climate resilience; how these and other efforts help to conserve our native biodiversity; and how all of us can play a part in this journey.</p><p>Strengthening Climate Resilience through Nature-based Solutions</p><p>Let me begin with nature-based solutions. These are efforts to enhance our natural environment, which in turn also help us to mitigate the effects of climate change. So nature-based solutions are win-win solutions, for nature and the city.</p><p>Let me briefly share three types of nature-based solutions that we are working on. First, we are using nature-based solutions to protect our coastlines. By planting trees and shrubs, as well as enhancing and restoring mangroves along our coasts, we can help to defend ourselves from rising sea levels, while at the same time, providing key habitats for marine and coastal species to thrive.</p><p>We started these efforts as early as 2010 when we enhanced the protections along the coastline of Pulau Tekong. Learning from this experience, we recently completed a similar coastal protection project at Kranji Coastal Nature Park, bordering the coast of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.</p><p>With the help of more than 250 enthusiastic members of our community, we successfully planted nearly 800 trees and shrubs to restore and enhance the coastal site, including rare species such as the Ormocarpum cochinchinense - a native tree previously thought to be extinct in Singapore.</p><p>Through such hard work, combined with good engineering, we established a natural green belt and low rock structures that will enhance the various habitats in the area, while protecting our coastlines from erosion.</p><p>I am therefore happy to announce that we will be embarking on two new and more extensive coastal protection projects on Pulau Ubin. These will be carried out in partnership with the community: one at the northern coastline, and the other in the south, at Sungei Durian. This will restore the island's coastlines and mangrove habitats, and bring back more of the island's rich biodiversity by addressing ongoing erosion and habitat loss.</p><p>Second, we are intensifying and enhancing nature in our green spaces, which will help to cool the environment. Today, more than 7,800 hectares of Singapore's total land area is set aside for green spaces like nature reserves, parks, and park connectors.</p><p>We are doing a lot more to enhance this, including setting aside another 1,000 hectares for green spaces and planting an additional one million trees through the OneMillionTrees movement. These trees and green spaces can sequester carbon, improve our air and water quality, provide shade for pedestrians, and cool our urban environment - especially in some of our hotter areas, such as in our industrial zones.</p><p>Third, we are naturalising more of our blue spaces - our waterways and waterbodies - which will also enhance our city's flood resilience. Over the past decade, we have been widening and deepening our existing drains, and building larger new drains, to improve our flood resilience.</p><p>We are also naturalising our waterways and waterbodies, by transforming concrete canals into natural rivers or streams, or reservoirs into natural lakes. This will help to reduce the risk of flash floods for adjacent properties. At the same time, it creates new habitats for wildlife and more recreational spaces for Singaporeans to enjoy. You can see the results of such work at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and Jurong Lake Gardens. We will continue to do this in our other parks and gardens.</p><p>Enhancing Our Biodiversity Conservation Efforts</p><p>In these ways, nature-based solutions can help to protect our coastlines, cool the environment, and improve our flood resilience. At the same time, they support our key strategies in building climate resilience under our City in Nature vision and improve our ecological resilience as well - by creating new habitats and connecting existing ones, nature-based solutions help us to better conserve our biodiversity.</p><p>We will continue to press on with our biodiversity conservation programmes. For example, through our species recovery programme, we make a special effort to conserve our key native flora and fauna, especially rare and threatened species, by reintroducing and propagating them into their original habitats, as well as suitable new habitats.</p><p>This year, we will add 13 new plant species, as well as 13 new animal species, to our species recovery programme. This includes the native orchid species, Nervilia singaporensis, previously thought to be extinct in Singapore. Yet it was re-discovered by our very own NParks researchers in July 2019 at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.</p><p>And we are committed to do more. We will set more ambitious targets, to increase our recovery efforts from 90 plant and 40 animal species currently, to 100 plant and 60 animal species by 2030.</p><p>Through research and development, we are also developing new technologies that aid in conservation. As part of NParks' Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef programme, we are experimenting with a new mineral accretion technology, which stimulates corals through low-voltage electricity, to promote coral growth.</p><p>And we are expanding our outreach efforts, to involve more people in our collective conservation efforts. For example, we are implementing the new Marine Educational Outreach programme for schools and the public on local marine biology and marine conservation.</p><p>Together, these marine conservation programmes will help to restore and enhance key habitats, including our coral reefs, which are particularly vulnerable to changing temperatures as a result of climate change. I would like to thank Aramco Asia Singapore - who are here with us today - for your generous donation, and strong support for these marine conservation initiatives.</p><p>We are already beginning to see the fruits of our conservation efforts. Two years ago, we shared that we were reviewing and updating the Singapore Red List, which indicates the conservation status of our biodiversity, including plants and animals that are vulnerable or endangered.</p><p>I am happy to share some updates from our ongoing review, which we will consolidate into the third edition of the Singapore Red Data Book, which is a key resource that guides our conservation strategies. Based on our current findings, over 40 of our animal species are now more resilient in Singapore. For example, the Sunda Slow Loris - which was previously a critically endangered species, is now less threatened in Singapore.</p><p>A recent study by NParks on the Lesser Mousedeer also highlights how the critically endangered population has recovered since the 1990s, which is highlighted by this review as well. This is also the first time that sponges and stony corals have been evaluated in the Singapore Red List, thanks to the increasing capabilities of our marine experts, and the growing interest in marine science in Singapore.</p><p>In fact, Singapore's contributions to biodiversity conservation go beyond our shores. We have just launched the updated version of the Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity. This is an index under the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity, used by cities worldwide to measure their progress in biodiversity conservation, and to guide their policies and plans in this area.</p><p>It was named after Singapore as we had first proposed it, and our very own NParks officers helped to develop it. We are proud to do what we can to support biodiversity conservation around the world, especially in cities and urban areas.</p><p>Partnering the Community</p><p>None of these achievements would have been possible without the strong support of our community partners. Over the years, we've seen a growing interest and passion in safeguarding our natural heritage among many Singaporeans.</p><p>Today, we have nearly 70 members in the Biodiversity Roundtable, from nature groups, schools, academia, as well as members of the Friends of the Parks initiatives. This is more than twice the number since the launch of this Festival in 2012. Our citizen scientists have also grown in strength - from less than 500 individuals to over 9,000 this year. They form part of NParks' volunteer base of over 54,000 individuals.</p><p>This is a very encouraging development, and we do hope that even more people will step forward and join us in our journey to transform Singapore into a City in Nature.</p><p>If you are interested to find out more about our local biodiversity, and how you can get involved in our conservation efforts, do participate in the Festival's events. We have had a series of in-person events such as tree-planting, with safe-distancing measures of course. And, we have planned a suite of virtual programmes, such as a virtual webinar on our rainforests, and stay-home activities, so that more Singaporeans can celebrate with us, in a safe manner.</p><p>Even beyond this Festival, there are always lots of ways to get involved, from tree-planting under our OneMillionTrees movement, to citizen science programmes under our Community in Nature initiative. Just visit our NParks website, follow us on Facebook or Telegram, or write to us at any time.</p><p>On that note, thank you once again Madam President, thank you to all our friends from the Festival of Biodiversity organizing committee and from the Biodiversity Roundtable. I wish you all a wonderful and safe Festival of Biodiversity.

The number registered has more than doubled from 16,000 in 2020 to 37,320 as at end-June. But the spike has also brought problems -- a rise in road accidents involving e-bikes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There were 157 accidents involving e-bikes in 2022, a slight rise from 150 in 2021 but doubling from 78 in 2020. Eight were fatal, and in August 2023, a 64-year-old e-bike rider died after being hit by a minibus in Hougang.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Motorised devices have speed limit restrictions, are banned from footpaths, and theory tests are mandatory to ride them on roads. Notices were issued by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to more than 5,000 e-bike users in 2022 for riding on footpaths.</p><p> Despite the regulations and active enforcement, e-bikes on roads still pose risks. Much of this stems from the tension between motorists and e-bike users.</p><p> In a report from The Straits Times that examined this, a seasoned e-bike user from Norway, who continued his practice in Singapore after he moved here, candidly said it was not for the faint of heart. He emphasised the need for drivers to treat bikers with more respect. Irate drivers have also expressed frustration at e-bike riders flouting traffic rules and norms, and riding dangerously.</p><p> The friction between the two modes of transport has been observed in other countries, even in contexts where traditional bicycles have long been part of daily life, such as in the Netherlands.</p><p> These experiences show that regulation, education and appropriate infrastructure are key to ensure that e-bikes can be well integrated to the fabric of cities as a sustainable mode of transportation.</p><p> This is important, as clearly e-bikes are here to stay: A large part of the rise of e-bikes has been their popularity with food delivery drivers, as they are cheaper to own and run than motorbikes. E-bikes are also popular with commuters who want to avoid crowded public transport or bridge the last-mile connection between transport hubs and home.</p><p>Singapore is already well primed for e-bikes due to its mostly flat landscape and excellent connectivity, so we should start considering making the city more conducive and safe for them. A bonus is that addressing these concerns can offer an opportunity to achieve other goals, as e-bikes can be part of a transition to a healthier and greener model of urbanisation.</p><p> Helping e-bikes have  their rightful placeBehavioural change and careful planning are needed to safely integrate e-bikes into existing transport networks. If we can overcome these barriers, e-bikes can help us reduce our long-held dependence on cars and motorcycles, alongside expanding and improving the public transport system.</p><p> Promoting a culture of mutual respect between car drivers and e-bike riders necessitates a comprehensive approach focused on heightened awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. For car drivers, a deepened understanding of the presence and rights of e-bike riders is imperative, facilitating a significant enhancement in shared road safety. Concurrently, e-bike enthusiasts should be equipped with a solid grounding in road etiquette, adherence to traffic regulations and safety protocols to ensure a more harmonious coexistence with other motorists.</p><p> Beyond changing attitudes and enforcing laws, there's a need for infrastructure. </p><p> Dedicated cycling lanes are necessary to keep both pedestrians and electric or pedal-powered riders safe. These could also provide alternative routes for riders who would otherwise travel on roads. They also take up far less space than multi-lane roads, freeing up much-needed land for green space. </p><p> It's worth noting that LTA is studying the feasibility of removing street-side parking to make way for cycling paths in some roads and has identified 60 sites to be converted into paths for pedestrians and cyclists. In its latest announcement in September on expanding Singapore's cycling connectivity, LTA called a tender to build 34.4km of new cycling paths in western and central Singapore. </p><p> But Singapore could take a stronger grip of the wheel in paving the path for green areas that are e-bike inclusive. In an earlier piece for ST in July that focused on nature-based solutions, I put stress on how Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and other Asean countries were struggling to find space for green infrastructure, including green roofs, parks and community gardens. Serving as an example to the region, Singapore can lead the way by making space for green areas integrated into cycling infrastructure.</p><p> Additionally, the potential benefits for our health are many, and it would help change mindsets to be more inclusive of e-bikes if people were more aware of this. Fewer cars and motorcycles on the road mean less air pollution. Expanding green spaces provides opportunities for recreation and physical activity, as well as having positive benefits for our mental health. Integrating green space across the city is also essential to conserve our precious biodiversity.</p><p> Reducing dependency on carsIn many ways, Singapore is the perfect city for e-bikes -- compact, well-connected and mostly flat. But, like most cities around the world, the Republic has an in-built dependency on cars. According to LTA, Singapore has 9,500km of roads, taking up a whopping 12 per cent of the total land area.</p><p> As we reduce our dependence on cars as part of the vision for a car-lite city, the expansion of the cycling network to accommodate e-bikes could lead to a win-win situation. Along with reducing air and noise pollution, e-bikes can lead to a city with fewer cars, which could free up valuable space from unnecessary roads and carparks in the long term.</p><p> They also are cheaper and offer greater flexibility in getting around -- especially with the expansion of cycling paths and park connectors.</p><p> Green benefits of  accepting e-bikesTransitioning to new forms of transport, including e-bikes, is a key step to rethink how we use our city and build a greener future. Around the world, we are seeing cities move from traditional grey infrastructure to greener alternatives.</p><p> The city of Sheffield in Britain, for example, is converting redundant roads into green spaces to reduce flood risk. The project, known as \"Grey to Green\", has reimagined an inner-city highway -- converting two lanes of the road into rain gardens and cycling lanes. The new green belt was integrated into the cycling network and also serves as a flood protection system by collecting excess rainwater.</p><p> Replacing roads and concrete carparks with cycling lanes and green spaces is also a key strategy to reduce the urban heat island effect. Due to their dark colour and impermeable surface, asphalt roads are good at holding heat. As Singapore feels the effects of a warming climate, reducing urban heat and providing cool spaces throughout the city will be essential to prevent heat stress. </p><p> Indeed, following Singapore's landmark vision of a City in Nature, the adoption of green cycling lanes could be the next step in a strategy to bring more green to the country.</p><p> It will take some careful urban planning, and a shift in the way we think, but e-bikes have the potential to play an important part in changing the way we use our city -- for the better.</p><p> Erich Wolff is a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University's Earth Observatory of Singapore. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["4km of new cycling paths in western and central Singapore.

Catalytic funding from the government would be an important starting point to lower the risks of adaptation-development projects, but the observers also said that it is paramount for the private sector to invest in such measures to build business resilience - especially for sectors such as agriculture, which is directly exposed to climate-change impacts.Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first Global Stocktake synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations (UN) Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.The need for blended finance Sharad Somani, partner and head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) at KPMG in Singapore, pointed out that adaptation measures are often seen as the poorer cousin of climate mitigation; they are under-invested, as the focus has been to contain climate impacts through the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions.That's because most adaptation measures tend to be public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems. And such projects tend not to lend themselves well to traditional commercial financing models, said Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public-sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re. </p><p>This is because dividends often manifest as a loss avoided, rather than an additive cash flow on which investors can rely on, he added.On top of these challenges are the facts that adaptation efforts are costly and most often needed in countries with limited resources, and they tend to be localised projects - where there are plenty of needs competing for limited funds, he also said.The Global Stocktake report found that financial support for adaptation continues to fall far behind mitigation investments. However, the share of total climate-specific financial support has grown to 28 per cent between 2019 and 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous two-year period. Citing forecasts from the UN Environment Programme, Somani pointed out that the annual cost of climate adaptation in poor countries alone could double or possibly even quadruple - from US$70 billion today to between US$140 billion and US$300 billion by 2030.To direct such high levels of capital towards climate adaptation, observers said that blended finance - which combines private, public and catalytic funding - is an important mechanism.Neha Bhatia, partner for ESG and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, said that beyond developing a baseline framework or policy guidelines from which adaptation projects can take off, governments can provide the first layer of capital to absorb the initial risk before partnering multilateral development banks, or local development financial institutions, for the next layer of developmental capital.\"Only then, when you de-risk to this point... private players with innovative solutions can come in and build adaptation solutions on top of that, because they know that they have a stable policy environment, they know they have risk support, they know they have technical support,\" she said. Catalytic funding, in the form of grants, government incentives or impact investment, can also be the first layer of capital that enables the development of pilot solutions and proofs of concept, said Varbanov. He added that such collaborative models spread the costs and risks of change over several different actors. Mobilising private finance To get more private financing into climate adaptation, Somani said there is a need to address companies' bias against such measures, which are often wrongly perceived as having low returns and impact. The bias is evident given that the private sector's contribution to adaptation measures stood at just 2 per cent of the global adaptation spend, according to data collated by non-profit outfit Climate Policy Initiative, he noted.As the impacts of climate change become more evident, businesses may actually end up forking out as much as 44 per cent of their profits to pay for damages caused by climate-related impacts, going by an economic study of nearly 15,000 public companies published in the journal Science last month. One way to unlock more private-sector financing for climate adaptation is to have companies pay more attention to disaster risk, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific Climate and Resilience Hub.For example, a coastal manufacturing facility located in the Philippines, which experiences 20 typhoons annually on average, would see the value of investing in the conservation of mangrove swamps. These natural ecosystems have proven to be effective in preventing storm surges from reaching inland.\"This is a public good... But the mangrove being there is providing (the factory) financial benefits. It's protecting your facilities. It's allowing you to exist... You may not own the mangrove, but we think you should invest in its conservation because it's protecting your facility,\" said Au. He also noted that there has been academic work showing that such nature-based solutions reduce losses from natural disasters by 25 per cent. With reduced losses as a result of climate adaptation, companies could potentially experience more affordable and stable insurance premiums as well, though observers noted that premiums may not actually come down given that many other factors are being considered when pricing them. While some told BT that there is a lack of data - regarding both adaptation activities and exposure to climate-related events - to help others understand how adaptation investments could affect broader risk assessments, Tobias Grimm said Munich Re has seen strong indications in its own data and analysis that climate change is a massive loss driver.The head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at the reinsurer said: \"Strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability - at both individual and community levels - will help to soften the societal and economic shocks of natural disasters.\"While all companies across all sectors should invest in strengthening their business resilience against climate-related events, the agriculture industry is particularly exposed to direct impacts, observers pointed out.With farmers facing more drastic weather cycles, major agribusinesses that depend on them as suppliers could consider extending loans to these farming cooperatives for them to invest in better irrigation systems or purchase seeds with higher yields, said Willis Tower Watson's Au. Financial institutions, though not directly hit by such events, have the most difficult and widespread exposure, said Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact. \"Portfolio managers face a daunting task (grappling) with widespread impact and inability to drive direct adaptation measures on the ground,\" they said. On the other hand, property developers are potentially big winners, especially those ahead of the curve on sustainable design and construction, said Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore. \"In the future, we can imagine floating residential districts off the coasts of Asia's big cities, integrated with resilient infrastructure. In the more immediate future, onshore developments can incorporate flood protection with restoration of waterways and urban regeneration, raising property values,\" she added. Technology companies with solutions to improve water efficiency and reuse wastewater also stand to benefit in an increasingly water-insecure region.Ultimately, regardless of the sector they are in, companies that take measures to strengthen their resilience against climate-related impacts would be able to stay ahead of the game, observers said.Those that are able to come up with adaptation solutions, such as climate-adaptive clothing that is able to cool down body temperatures, or incorporate drought- or flood-resilient materials in construction, could also come out on top, said Bhatia of ERM. Sometimes, adaptation actions do not have to come in the form of an infrastructure project, which is the conventional idea of what such measures entail. Au noted that some companies are already increasing their resilience by identifying risks in their supply chains and addressing, diversifying or shortening them. \"The market will increasingly favour forward-looking companies that prioritise sustainability and are mitigating and adapting to climate change for a robust supply chain,\" said KPMG's Somani.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": [".

An island created from reclaimed land in Johor across from Singapore.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The setting seems idyllic, but this is not a primary coastal forest. It is an island of tower-block apartments and other residential infrastructure called Forest City. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The same place is often referred to by the media as \"ghost city\", a mega-development by Chinese investors that was never completed amid the Covid-19 pandemic and financial woes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> News reports about the development often underscore its falling into disrepair and neglect. Main backer Country Garden's target was to have 700,000 people living in the completed 1,370ha development, but the artificial city launched in 2016 has barely 10,000 residents today. It was even branded the \"World's 2nd Most Useless Mega Project\" by YouTube channel Top Luxury.</p><p> Less covered are the ways in which Mother Earth is making her presence felt.</p><p> Nature returnsAs someone who lives in the community around Forest City Island and has studied its rise, I have seen the seagrass and mangroves return.</p><p> It's not just me. Students and staff at the Shattuck-St Mary's Forest City (SSM-FC) International School -- set up in the early days of Forest City -- have been trained by a local community organisation, Kelab Alami, as citizen scientists. Over the past two years, under the leadership of its head, Dr Gregg Maloberti, they have documented the wilding of the island.</p><p> The results are fascinating. Ms Glenda Lakey, a teacher at SSM-FC, has recorded more than 100 species of birds, both resident and migratory. The island has become an important stopover for migrating birds from the Northern Hemisphere that head south for the winter.</p><p> She has recorded a number of rarely seen migratory species such as the ruddy kingfisher -- a highly sought-after species by bird-watching enthusiasts -- as well as the blue-tailed bee eater and blue-throated bee eater.</p><p> Students under her tutelage excitedly point out milky storks and lesser adjutant storks on the mudflats or walking through the mangroves, both of which are endangered and endemic to South-east Asia.</p><p> Ironically, the very same problems that Forest City faced amid a property crisis in China and the lockdown during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic have enabled nature to thrive. </p><p> Yet, it is hard to pinpoint when the birds started returning. When Ms Lakey first arrived at Forest City, her early-morning walks were eerily silent. Now, just before dawn breaks, the campus is filled with the sounds of both the large-tailed nightjar and savannah nightjar. Art class students on the top floor are often visited by a pair of oriental pied hornbills. At night, the red-wattled lapwing can be heard screeching.</p><p> It is a small school, and the 250 or so students and staff have caught on to the initiative to record and report the many animals, reptiles and insects spotted. They reflect in wonder at the healthy biodiversity slowly engulfing the island.</p><p> The community organisation also works with the school to document nearby seagrass habitats. Mangroves have settled naturally along the island's shores, with marine fauna such as endangered horseshoe crabs and juvenile catfish returning -- living proof that the habitats are beginning to serve their function as breeding grounds for more marine life.  </p><p> When Forest City removed a bridge previously created to facilitate the transport of sand, the seagrass meadow grew back within two weeks. Local community reports indicate that this has expanded to areas once buried by reclaimed land. </p><p> These habitats are vital to the local fishing community and have been key fishing and gleaning areas supporting their livelihoods. </p><p> SSM-FC continues to be the heartbeat of the island. About four in 10 of its families live in Forest City apartments; the others are boarders or children of the faculty.</p><p> The school is now showing the way by actively engaging with residents for environmental activities such as mangrove-tree planting and beach cleanups, at least once every quarter over the past year.</p><p> A mixed luxury residential-and- business development that began reclamation works in 2015, Forest City has been infamous for its sudden appearance and a subsequent stop-work order by the Malaysian Department of the Environment. The project did not complete a Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment, required by Malaysian law for all reclamation projects. </p><p> After some controversy and a revision of the original development plans, the project continued apace. It was officially launched in 2016, with the first keys handed over to apartment owners in 2018.</p><p> In the early days, Forest City was touted as a revolutionary approach to island creation and development, with innovative technology in land settlement that enabled piling work to begin just three months after sand dumping. Since then, Chinese government-imposed capital controls stalled most publicised property sales as its mainly middle-income buyers from China could not complete payments.</p><p> The  pandemic put paid to any further ambitions for development expansion. Forest City was closed off to the world for health security reasons. Hundreds of construction workers, housed in hostels in the surrounding fishing villages of Mukim Tanjung Kupang, were sent home. </p><p> Subsequently, Country Garden, which has a 60 per cent stake in the Forest City project, recorded more than US$150 billion (S$199 billion) in losses and defaulted on debt repayments, putting the future of the island development further in doubt. </p><p> In sales presentations in China, Country Garden -- which says it is business as usual for its Malaysian project -- notes that it will not build the other three islands initially planned for land reclamation, given the environmental impact. Property analysts note a more plausible reason for the about-turn: financial difficulties.  </p><p> The remaining 40 per cent stake in Forest City is held by the Johor state government, which has a vested interest in its success. In a recent interview with The Straits Times, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor, who will be appointed Malaysia's king in January 2024, announced an interest in reviving the high-speed rail (HSR) project linking Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, and diverting it through Forest City.</p><p> With the King having played a critical role as kingmaker during Malaysia's 2022 General Election, there was little surprise when Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced plans in August to make Forest City a special financial zone (SFZ). </p><p> This will, among other things, fast-track entry for those working in Singapore and provide preferential income tax rates, to boost investment. </p><p> Today, many of Forest City's residents are renters, largely made up of Malaysians working in Singapore who commute daily to work. On Dec 12, a new bus link to the Second Link bridge and Tuas was announced, making it even easier for visitors or renters to cross the border.</p><p> Integrated living with naturePerhaps the SFZ and the HSR will deliver the necessary financial injection to revive the island. Such a strong endorsement by the Malaysian government bodes well, considering the disparagement and attempts to kill the project by past administrations.</p><p> This also augurs well for new approaches to integrate \"forest\" and \"city\". Research by the community and Kelab Alami has shown that nature can regenerate over areas left fallow around the artificial island. The budding prospects of eco-tourism are bright. </p><p> This would require Forest City's management to work actively with the local community to continue protection and research of its surrounding habitats to avoid accusations of greenwashing. </p><p> Modest efforts are already under way. Blossom Landscape Forest City, the developer's subsidiary, has transformed the island's greenery, previously manicured to look like a golf course using non-native plants. After the pandemic and toll of the tropical weather, the landscaping was replaced with native species, many grown in nurseries in the surrounding villages. </p><p> Today, the area thrives with local flora, and has riverine walkways reminiscent of Sungai Api-Api in Pasir Ris in Singapore. Artificial lakes and wetlands seem so natural, with frequent shorebird and otter sightings, that one almost forgets the entire space is man-made.</p><p> News stories carry narratives of Forest City descending into a ghost town, with people expressing buyers' remorse. Yet, reporters I have spoken to gathering information for stories on the development often comment in bewilderment that residents they interviewed seem pretty happy. </p><p> I have met residents perched on the beach and exhaling in satisfaction at the seaview. Indeed, if you stand on the reclaimed beachfront of the Ataraxia apartments that look out to where the Johor and Melaka Strait meet, the fresh sea breeze makes it easy to overlook how much damage the island construction has caused to the environment. </p><p> Yet, the constant redevelopment in this area is a stark reminder that industrial build-up has not been confined to Forest City alone. There are plans at the nearby Tanjung Piai Maritime Industrial Park for the reclamation of a 1,410ha island for oil, gas and chemical storage. The Port of Tanjung Pelepas and the Tuas Mega Port are both expanding facilities in the vicinity. </p><p> Acknowledging past problemsDr Qiu Lipeng, Country Garden Malaysia-Singapore's region vice-president, acknowledged the problems that arose in the early days, but stressed greater efforts to reduce Forest City's environmental impact. </p><p> \"I cannot stop the development,\" he said, \"but I will make sure that our construction does as little damage as possible.\" </p><p> He was stunned by the rich biodiversity that I showed him on the seagrass meadows at low tide, just off the main Forest City beachfront. He seemed determined to support the local fishing community's eco-tourism and seafood sales. Residents at Forest City are often sent reminders via their community's online chat groups to buy fresh from local fishermen. </p><p> He told me he has directed his hotel, communications and other project-management departments to work with community representatives on the promotion of local natural and cultural heritage, through tours offered by the community, or by showcasing local ecological knowledge and research outputs in the Forest City EcoMuseum. The access road to surrounding villages has also been repaired, facilitating engagements with local small businesses and communities. </p><p> When SSM-FC conducted mangrove-planting events, it sent out invitations to Forest City residents and several turned up with children in tow. A number asked how often these programmes were run, and how they could get involved in other activities. When the school decided to do a beach cleanup in September, several of the same faces turned up to help. </p><p> Dr Maloberti told me that as he toured China engaging with potential buyers to tell them about the strengths of SSM-FC, most parents were attracted by the sustainability aspects of the project. The citizen science programmes and other environmental events were of key interest, as were links between the school, Forest City, and the local fishing community and its surrounding seas. </p><p> There is much more Forest City can do to enhance its value proposition in sustainability. For one thing, the development was first pitched as a car-free, cycling-friendly development with elevated walkways and centralised parking facilities to keep it safe and pedestrian-friendly. There is little traffic, and buggy services ferry residents around, but the lack of pavements between the school and nearby apartments remains a bugbear.</p><p> Forest City could also examine how its buildings could be more habitable towards migratory species, following the lead of SSM-FC. Students and staff there encounter migratory birds when many fly into the windows of their buildings. One solution the school is working on is reflective stickers, a simple but effective means to warn birds of otherwise transparent glass windows. </p><p> Perhaps in integrating cities with nature, the Forest City developer should consult the community and Kelab Amani for local nature-based solutions to improve local ecology. They would know what works best in the area, having done the work for almost 20 years. </p><p> Forest City could also include green concepts -- green corridors and eco-bridges -- in the development, which have proven successful in Singapore and other parts of South-east Asia.</p><p> Life comes backHuman life, too, is returning to Forest City. There are many more lights on in apartments at night, according to SSM-FC staff who head to the beachfront pubs and cafes for a drink after work. Whenever I go to the island on weekends to check on habitats or the EcoMuseum, the water parks and swimming pools are full of Malaysian families.  </p><p> Residents say there have been new investments, with repairs and overdue maintenance works ongoing in the second half of 2023. </p><p> It is heartening to see the pause in development allowing the island to become part of the surrounding ecosystem -- an unexpected positive, considering the environmental problems plaguing Forest City from the outset. But while the federal and state governments work to boost investments, the most appealing aspect of Forest City is its fresh sustainability drive. </p><p> Home-grown efforts to welcome and integrate the island's new residents with the local community through seafood sales, habitat tours and citizen science training are things few other developments can offer. </p><p> Much of the returning plant and animal life was not mentioned in the environmental impact assessment for Forest City. Their revival demonstrates how nature can recover if left alone. It is now up to the developer and residents to make sure they can thrive.</p><p> Serina Rahman is a lecturer in the South-east Asian Studies Department at the National University of Singapore.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Students and staff there encounter migratory birds when many fly into the windows of their buildings.

'Long Island' will protect against rising sea levels, preserve East Coast Park, enhance water resilience, and create more waterfront for outdoor recreation. Extensive environmental and engineering studies will be conducted to determine the feasibility of 'Long Island'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Original Press Release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nov. 28 -- Urban Redevelopment Authority, Government of Singapore issued the following speech by Mr Desmond Lee:</p><p>Good morning everyone. I am glad to be here today, to join grassroot leaders, colleagues, and stakeholders to plant coastal trees to enhance East Coast Park.</p><p>For those of us who are old enough to remember, the land we are currently on used to be the sea. Land was reclaimed from the sea, from here all the way to Marine Parade Road.</p><p>This was called the \"Great Reclamation\": it was an ambitious reclamation project along the south-eastern coast of Singapore that our pioneer leaders embarked on, shortly after our independence. Full-scale reclamation work started in 1966, and over twenty years, we gradually added over 1,500 hectares of land, equivalent to 2,100 football fields, stretching from Tanah Merah Besar all the way to Telok Ayer Basin. Now this created additional space for Singapore, to build schools and homes, and to create job opportunities.</p><p>Our pioneers also envisioned that this reclaimed segment would be, \"a principal recreational lung for the whole island\". East Coast Park was opened in the 1970s on this reclaimed land, and we have gradually added new recreational facilities and green spaces over the subsequent years and decades.</p><p>We will continue to improve East Coast Park. For example, my NParks colleagues will create a 15 km nature trail along East Coast Park over the next eight years. The trail will connect existing and upcoming recreational and green spaces in the park, and bring you closer to greenery and to nature. Our tree planting efforts later this morning will contribute to this new nature trail.</p><p>Coastal Protection at East Coast</p><p>Let me now speak a little bit about coastal protection here at East Coast. When our pioneers embarked on the reclamation of East Coast more than 50 years ago, they were not only addressing immediate and pressing challenges that Singapore faced at that time. They were looking very far ahead, imagining what the future might look like, and creating space and opportunity for future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>We must continue this discipline of long-term planning. Thinking about future generations, and not just about ourselves.</p><p>One major area of work for us, is preparing for the long-term impact of climate change. As a low-lying island state, rising sea levels poses an existential threat to Singapore. Mean sea levels around Singapore are projected to rise by up to 1 metre by the end of this century. When high tides coincide with storm surges, sea levels could rise by up to 4 to 5 metres above mean sea level (AMSL). This is a very serious problem, because around one-third of our island is below 5 metres above mean sea level, and at risk of being inundated by the sea. While it may seem quite distant from today, we have to start planning and preparing now.</p><p>The East Coast of Singapore is low-lying and faces a high risk of flooding. We have already experienced flooding along this stretch. In January this year, some parts of East Coast Park were flooded for around two hours.</p><p>We need to put in measures to protect our homes and livelihoods in this area, and have been studying various coastal protection measures and options.</p><p>One possible measure is to build a sea wall along the entire coastline from the City to East Coast. You can call it a \"Long Wall\" approach.</p><p>Under this option, we will need to build a continuous sea wall that is up to 3m in height along the entire waterfront of East Coast Park, from Marina East to Tanah Merah. We will also have to build 12 tidal gates and pumping stations along each of the existing outlet drains along East Coast Park to keep the sea out and to pump rainwater out, when heavy rain coincides with high tide. Many of you would have seen the tidal gate and pumping station at the Marina Barrage which serves this same function. So imagine a smaller version of this tidal gate and pumping station, and having 12 of these along East Coast Park to provide coastal defence for the entire stretch of coastline.</p><p>This option is technically feasible, but it is really not ideal for East Coast Park. This is because, we will need to close off large stretches of East Coast Park from the public when constructing the sea wall and the tidal gate. After construction is complete, the sea wall will permanently limit park users' access to the waterfront for recreation and sports. The 12 tidal gates and pumping stations will also take up a lot of space within East Coast Park, around the size of 15 football fields. So you can imagine if we adopt this \"Long Wall\" approach, a lot of existing greenery and recreational facilities must go. In essence, this approach means we implement coastal protection along the existing East Coast Park, but lose significant portions of the park and recreational use of the coastline.</p><p>Long Island</p><p>A more optimal solution that we have been studying is: to integrate coastal protection measures with our future reclamation plans for the area. This idea of 'Long Island' was raised by Prime Minister during the National Day Rally in 2019, and showcased at URA's Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) exhibition in 2022.</p><p>We received a lot of feedback and suggestions on the 'Long Island' concept, during the Long-Term Plan Review, as well as PUB's \"Our Coastal Conversations\". For instance, while people recognised the vital importance of protecting low lying areas, they wanted to retain unimpeded access to the waterfront. The area also holds fond memories for many Singaporeans, and many hoped that we could preserve the heritage and recreational spaces along our coast.</p><p>We have taken many of these pieces of feedback onboard. So let me take this opportunity to update you on the latest concept, the latest thinking, behind 'Long Island': The concept of 'Long Island' is to project coastal protection seawards, by reclaiming three new tracts of land, at a higher level, away from the current coastline. This will allow us to retain the existing East Coast Park, largely as it is. It will also create an enclosed waterbody, preserving the waterfront character of the original East Coast Park. Over time, the waterbody will become a freshwater reservoir, which the public can use for water activities such as canoeing and dragon-boating. The reservoir will also add to our water supply. There will be two large tidal gates and pumping stations on the reclaimed 'Long Island', as compared to twelve smaller ones along East Coast Park in the other option that I spoke about earlier. These tidal gates and pumping stations will also be much further away from existing residential and recreational spaces. Here is an artist's impression of how 'Long Island' might look like from the existing East Coast Park.</p><p>While we are still working out the details, the reclaimed 'Long Island' may potentially be around 800 ha, about twice the size of Marina Bay. This creates opportunities for future generations of Singaporeans. They could build homes, create jobs, develop services and amenities that they need, and add around 20 km of new coastal and reservoir parks, extending from the current East Coast Park. This would triple the length of the existing waterfront area along East Coast Park today.</p><p>Let me show you an artist impression of what 'Long Island' could potentially look like when it is finally completed.</p><p>So, in essence, 'Long Island' will help us to achieve a number of objectives: (a) primarily, protect us from rising sea-levels, (b) second, preserve the existing East Coast Park for park users, (c) third, enhance our water resilience, (d) fourth, develop more waterfront for outdoor recreation, and (e) fifth, create land optionality and opportunity for future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>Technical Studies and Public Engagement</p><p>Because 'Long Island' is a very major undertaking, the planning and implementation will take decades. We are still at a very early stage in this journey. The pictures you have seen are just artist impressions, examples of what might be possible. The final shape and form of 'Long Island' will evolve over time, and we must wait for the studies to be undertaken. As a start, we will need to kickstart extensive environmental and engineering studies to see if the conceptual reclamation profile is feasible, and formulate innovative and cost-effective nature-based solutions to reclaim and develop 'Long Island'. We expect the studies to take around five years. These studies will need to begin now, so that 'Long Island' can be realised in time to protect the area from rising sea levels.</p><p>In parallel, we will also be engaging residents and stakeholders, and collecting more feedback and ideas from Singaporeans. We want to hear from as many of you as possible - the general public, residents, businesses in the local area, the nature and heritage community, sports and recreational interest groups and many more. Join us to explore the possibilities. When we complete the technical studies, we will also engage you on the design and masterplanning for 'Long Island'.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In closing, 'Long Island' holds tremendous opportunities and possibilities for Singaporeans to come together, and lead the way in showing what can be done and what be possible in dealing with climate change and rising sea levels.</p><p>As we protect our homes, infrastructure, livelihoods, and our cherished East Coast Park, we will collectively create new opportunities for quality living and recreation, for the benefit of Singaporeans today and for our future generations.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp; Defense, Commercial Services &amp; Supplies, Events]</p><p>Source: Urban Redevelopment Authority, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["The pictures you have seen are just artist impressions, examples of what might be possible.

Trees soak up and store large amounts of CO2 as they grow. </p><p> \"Although we sell many other types of credits, we still believe that nature-based solutions are a very important part of the market -- hence why we're coming to market first with CNX, which is a nature-based solution contract,\" he told The Straits Times. </p><p> The CNX contract bundles 11 forest conservation projects. These projects are under the United Nations' Redd+ scheme, which refers to the reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, the conservation and sustainable management of forests, and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks. </p><p> The 11 projects are in Africa, Asia and the Americas and generate about two-thirds of all global Redd+ credits on the market. This ensures there is ample supply of offsets available -- each CNX lot equates to 1,000 carbon credits.</p><p> Companies buy these offsets to reduce their own carbon footprint, especially in areas where it is hard to cut emissions to reach net-zero. </p><p> This idea underpins the roughly US$2 billion (S$2.7 billion) a year voluntary carbon market, in which investors who develop projects that reduce or avoid CO2 emissions are rewarded with the sale of their verified offsets to a buyer looking to reduce their emissions. </p><p> Traders also buy the offsets to sell later for a profit if the market rises. </p><p> But the market has long been clouded by criticisms that many projects lack integrity, do not lead to meaningful emissions reductions, or that some credit buyers are greenwashing. </p><p> For example, buyers may use the credits to claim they are tackling climate change, but they are not taking meaningful steps to reduce emissions themselves. </p><p> Mr Larsen said CIX recognises these concerns but that the firm conducts thorough vetting of all projects that are featured on its marketplace, sold at regular auctions or will be available for spot trading on the new exchange. </p><p> He said doubts about the market had hurt prices and buying interest, but the aim of the exchange is to help boost confidence.</p><p> \"Many people have asked me: 'Why would you launch now''\" Mr Larsen said, referring to the spot exchange, especially since competitors such as AirCarbon Exchange already conduct spot trading in Singapore. </p><p> \"I think that this is part of the contribution to making nature-based climate solutions credible again,\" he said. </p><p> A key to this is trying to establish a benchmark market price for nature-based offsets and to create liquidity through daily spot trading of the CNX contract and offsets from a total of 34 nature-based projects listed on the exchange. </p><p> \"What we want to give is certainty of delivery, and we want to give certainty of execution. We've not come to market in a rush,\" he added.</p><p> \"With our contract, if our (CNX) benchmark goes up, then the price for the other projects hopefully will go up as well. And that's what we're trying to create -- a reliable benchmark, and there isn't such a thing today.\"</p><p> CNX aims to establish a benchmark price for credits issued between 2019 and 2022.</p><p> Mr Larsen said the plan is to keep expanding the types of spot trading contracts on the exchange and eventually lay the groundwork for futures contracts.</p><p> If the exchange is successful, he said it would show that Singapore, despite its size, can create global market liquidity for carbon spot trading. </p><p> \"And hopefully that will be another cornerstone ensuring Singapore can be a carbon market, not just for Singapore but... for other countries as well.\"</p><p> CIX is jointly owned by DBS, Singapore Exchange (SGX Group), Standard Chartered and Temasek's green investment company GenZero.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["These include projects such as mangrove replanting or those that restore and protect large areas of rainforest from being chopped down for agriculture or mining.

And such projects tend not to lend themselves well to traditional commercial financing models, said Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public-sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re. </p><p> This is because dividends often manifest as a loss avoided, rather than an additive cash flow on which investors can rely on, he added.</p><p> On top of these challenges are the facts that adaptation efforts are costly and most often needed in countries with limited resources, and they tend to be localised projects -- where there are plenty of needs competing for limited funds, he also said.</p><p> The Global Stocktake report found that financial support for adaptation continues to fall far behind mitigation investments. However, the share of total climate-specific financial support has grown to 28 per cent between 2019 and 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous two-year period. </p><p> Citing forecasts from the UN Environment Programme, Somani pointed out that the annual cost of climate adaptation in poor countries alone could double or possibly even quadruple -- from US$70 billion today to between US$140 billion and US$300 billion by 2030.</p><p> To direct such high levels of capital towards climate adaptation, observers said that blended finance -- which combines private, public and catalytic funding -- is an important mechanism.</p><p> Neha Bhatia, partner for ESG and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, said that beyond developing a baseline framework or policy guidelines from which adaptation projects can take off, governments can provide the first layer of capital to absorb the initial risk before partnering multilateral development banks, or local development financial institutions, for the next layer of developmental capital.</p><p> \"Only then, when you de-risk to this point... private players with innovative solutions can come in and build adaptation solutions on top of that, because they know that they have a stable policy environment, they know they have risk support, they know they have technical support,\" she said. </p><p> Catalytic funding, in the form of grants, government incentives or impact investment, can also be the first layer of capital that enables the development of pilot solutions and proofs of concept, said Varbanov. He added that such collaborative models spread the costs and risks of change over several different actors. </p><p> Mobilising private finance To get more private financing into climate adaptation, Somani said there is a need to address companies' bias against such measures, which are often wrongly perceived as having low returns and impact. </p><p> The bias is evident given that the private sector's contribution to adaptation measures stood at just 2 per cent of the global adaptation spend, according to data collated by non-profit outfit Climate Policy Initiative, he noted. As the impacts of climate change become more evident, businesses may actually end up forking out as much as 44 per cent of their profits to pay for damages caused by climate-related impacts, going by an economic study of nearly 15,000 public companies published in the journal Science last month. </p><p> One way to unlock more private-sector financing for climate adaptation is to have companies pay more attention to disaster risk, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific Climate and Resilience Hub.</p><p> For example, a coastal manufacturing facility located in the Philippines, which experiences 20 typhoons annually on average, would see the value of investing in the conservation of mangrove swamps. These natural ecosystems have proven to be effective in preventing storm surges from reaching inland.</p><p> \"This is a public good... But the mangrove being there is providing (the factory) financial benefits. It's protecting your facilities. It's allowing you to exist... You may not own the mangrove, but we think you should invest in its conservation because it's protecting your facility,\" said Au. </p><p> He also noted that there has been academic work showing that such nature-based solutions reduce losses from natural disasters by 25 per cent. </p><p> With reduced losses as a result of climate adaptation, companies could potentially experience more affordable and stable insurance premiums as well, though observers noted that premiums may not actually come down given that many other factors are being considered when pricing them. </p><p> While some told BT that there is a lack of data -- regarding both adaptation activities and exposure to climate-related events -- to help others understand how adaptation investments could affect broader risk assessments, Tobias Grimm said Munich Re has seen strong indications in its own data and analysis that climate change is a massive loss driver.</p><p> The head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at the reinsurer said: \"Strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability -- at both individual and community levels -- will help to soften the societal and economic shocks of natural disasters.\"</p><p> While all companies across all sectors should invest in strengthening their business resilience against climate-related events, the agriculture industry is particularly exposed to direct impacts, observers pointed out.</p><p> With farmers facing more drastic weather cycles, major agribusinesses that depend on them as suppliers could consider extending loans to these farming cooperatives for them to invest in better irrigation systems or purchase seeds with higher yields, said Willis Tower Watson's Au. </p><p> Financial institutions, though not directly hit by such events, have the most difficult and widespread exposure, said Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact. </p><p> \"Portfolio managers face a daunting task (grappling) with widespread impact and inability to drive direct adaptation measures on the ground,\" they said. </p><p> On the other hand, property developers are potentially big winners, especially those ahead of the curve on sustainable design and construction, said Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore. </p><p> \"In the future, we can imagine floating residential districts off the coasts of Asia's big cities, integrated with resilient infrastructure. In the more immediate future, onshore developments can incorporate flood protection with restoration of waterways and urban regeneration, raising property values,\" she added. </p><p> Technology companies with solutions to improve water efficiency and reuse wastewater also stand to benefit in an increasingly water-insecure region.</p><p> Ultimately, regardless of the sector they are in, companies that take measures to strengthen their resilience against climate-related impacts would be able to stay ahead of the game, observers said.</p><p> Those that are able to come up with adaptation solutions, such as climate-adaptive clothing that is able to cool down body temperatures, or incorporate drought- or flood-resilient materials in construction, could also come out on top, said Bhatia of ERM. </p><p> Sometimes, adaptation actions do not have to come in the form of an infrastructure project, which is the conventional idea of what such measures entail. </p><p> Au noted that some companies are already increasing their resilience by identifying risks in their supply chains and addressing, diversifying or shortening them. </p><p> \"The market will increasingly favour forward-looking companies that prioritise sustainability and are mitigating and adapting to climate change for a robust supply chain,\" said KPMG's Somani.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": [". You may not own the mangrove, but we think you should invest in its conservation because it's protecting your facility,\" said Au. With reduced losses as a result of climate adaptation, companies could potentially experience more affordable and stable insurance premiums as well, though observers noted that premiums may not actually come down given that many other factors are being considered when pricing them.

Protecting mature forests and engaging in reforestation can help to maintain stored carbon and/or increase nature's capacity to draw it back down.</p><p> Recent research has indicated that between 2001 and 2019, global forests acted as a net carbon sink through natural growth, removing around 7.6 gigatonnes of CO2 per year from the atmosphere.</p><p> Clearly, this is a crucially important ecosystem service. Beyond the lens of net zero, forests provide other benefits such as biodiversity preservation and water management.</p><p> Thinking along these lines, and in a world where CO2 is increasingly valued, the dynamics of forests as an asset class are changing. </p><p> Traditionally, forestry was viewed as a source of predictable cash flows from products such as wood, pulp and paper, and has been used to hedge against inflation.</p><p> Now, forests have become a key means of addressing carbon footprints. There are other reasons to rethink forest assets. If managed sustainably, forests can provide bio-based products that reduce the reliance on emissions-intensive equivalents -- for example, cross-laminated timber in buildings rather than steel, concrete or plastic alternatives.</p><p> Furthermore, there is the generation of carbon-offset credits. Owners of forests can recognise and capitalise on their annual carbon storage through these carbon credits.</p><p> Investors in forests therefore can take credit for any carbon offsets generated by their investments, reducing residual emissions in their portfolios.</p><p> Surplus credits generated could be sold to third parties. In such a case, only the buyers of the credits could then recognise the potential offset.</p><p>  A market in carbon offsets from forests could reach US$800 billion by 2050, driven by investors and corporates interested in offsetting unavoidable emissions. BloombergNEF predicts offset prices could reach up to US$215 per ton in 2030, from an average of around US$2.50 today.</p><p> It is important, however, that forest carbon credits are generated carefully and verifiably according to recognised standards to ensure a real-world CO2 reduction. This is needed to avoid poor quality projects that result in \"junk\" credits entering into circulation. This problem has plagued offset markets. Initiatives that bolster trust such as the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets should help.</p><p> Wildfires -- like those seen recently in France and across Europe -- represent another threat to carbon offsets and the permanence of stored CO2, and will need to be taken into account when designing effective offset projects.</p><p> A strategic asset allocationIt is becoming clear that achieving net zero only through the reduction of CO2 emissions by large corporates is unlikely to suffice. Unavoidable emissions will remain, despite best efforts, given the existing technological constraints. Therefore, significant investment in reforestation, afforestation and nature-based solutions will be critical to achieving net zero.</p><p> We believe forestry represents a strategic asset class to which institutional investors are underexposed. </p><p> Currently, investors have around US$100 billion dedicated to forestry, compared to around US$4 trillion in private equity.</p><p> In our view, forests are attractive thanks to portfolio diversification. They offer the prospect of positive returns through carbon price increases and through rising demand for wood from sustainable sources. </p><p> Recent rounds of timber inflation underscore the financial value of this important commodity. Forests also support carbon reduction and biodiversity.</p><p> To boost the appeal of forests as an investment, one will need to consider the opportunity and risks from traditional forest product sales, as well as new ones involving carbon offsets. This is particularly the case in emerging markets as 71 per cent of the unrealised CO2 sequestration potential exists in tropical ecosystems.</p><p> It is also important to consider how policy related to these assets will change in the future. Similar to a broader Inevitable Policy Response (IPR), there could be opportunities for investors in a significant, inevitable forest finance response. Net-zero commitments together with the relative affordability and scalability of nature-based climate solutions can help reverse the current deforestation trend.</p><p> IPR's Forecast Policy Scenario expects net forest-cover loss to cease by 2030, and 350 million hectares of afforestation and reforestation to occur by 2050. Consideration will need to be given not only to the availability of land for reforestation, but also to the impact on food production and biodiversity hotspots.</p><p> We believe there is significant unrealised potential and an opportunity for investors when it comes to forestry -- both to diversify portfolios and to support carbon reduction efforts. </p><p> The writer is biodiversity lead, BNP Paribas Asset Management.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Cutting emissions requires a major focus and effort across the economy.

It is essential for our survival - here in this region and globally.</p><p>Sweden, with the rest of the European Union, has launched the European Green Deal with the aim of making Europe the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050.</p><p>Here in Southeast Asia, nine countries have articulated net-zero goals by or around mid-century.</p><p>Singapore, on our part, has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with the public sector committing to net-zero by 2045, 5 years earlier.</p><p>Two years ago, we published the Singapore Green Plan 2030 charting ambitious and concrete targets to advance our national agenda on sustainable development.</p><p>The Green Plan recognises that any successful green transition must involve all stakeholders and leverage a range of policy tools and programmes.</p><p>We have boosted the adoption of electric vehicles and accelerated the transition of the use of cleaner and lower-carbon fuels for our maritime and aviation sectors.</p><p>We are also investing in building green skills in our workforce - such as carbon footprint management, and energy management and audit - to prepare them to pivot to a low-carbon future.</p><p>In 2019, Singapore also became the first country in Southeast Asia to implement a carbon tax.</p><p>We are raising this progressively in stages until 2030, to strengthen the price signal and impetus for businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p>Our carbon pricing trajectory will enhance the business case to invest in low-carbon solutions, helping businesses remain competitive in a low-carbon future.</p><p>The revenue collected from the carbon tax will be used to support decarbonisation efforts and the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as cushion the impact on businesses and households.</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore, our central bank, is also supporting the mobilisation of green and transition finance to catalyse greater climate action in the region.</p><p>Two days ago at COP-28, MAS launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy, the first of its kind globally to comprehensively define transition activities across 8 focus sectors.</p><p>By providing an objective definition on whether economic activities are green or transition, taxonomies guide investors and financiers to channel capital responsibly.</p><p>This new Singapore-Asia Taxonomy will enable financing to flow to climate-friendly transition activities while minimising the risk of greenwashing.</p><p>MAS has also launched a Transition Credits Coalition, or TRACTION.</p><p>This will study the challenges and propose solutions to scale the early retirement of coal-fired power plants in Asia through high-integrity carbon credits.</p><p>I said earlier that innovation can help us address global challenges.</p><p>To support our R&amp;D ambitions, Singapore has committed about S$25 billion between 2021 and 2025 to strengthen our research, innovation and enterprise capabilities.</p><p>A big part of this, complementing our green transition, is being channelled towards the urban solutions and sustainability domain.</p><p>Our universities and research institutes are studying low-carbon energy solutions like hydrogen, decarbonising the built environment, tackling urban heat, and sustainable agri-food production.</p><p>Some companies, partnering with our universities, have also set up various Corporate Labs pursuing market-relevant research in clean energy and sustainability solutions. Climate change also has a significant impact on human health. Many researchers and institutes in both Sweden and Singapore are also working on this.</p><p>The impact of such innovation and research can be amplified significantly through cross-border and cross-regional collaboration.</p><p>Singapore and Sweden are well-positioned to leverage strong frameworks of cooperation and deepen our linkages in this area.</p><p>The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, for instance, has added robustness to Singapore's economic ties with Sweden.</p><p>Since the Free Trade Agreement entered into force in 2019, bilateral trade in goods has increased by nearly 25% and trade in services has risen by almost 50%.</p><p>The Free Trade Agreement also commits both sides to resolving non-tariff barriers including for renewable energy generation.</p><p>In addition, the Free Trade Agreement protects intellectual property and soft assets, including many innovative green technologies.</p><p>More recently, we have also launched negotiations on an EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement, to enhance digital connectivity between the two sides and give businesses added confidence to transact in the digital economy.</p><p>The digital revolution is closely interlinked with the green transition. New digital solutions and technologies can potentially help accelerate our progress to a greener, more sustainable future.</p><p>Singapore looks forward to the Swedish business community's support for the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement, which will help send a strong signal on shaping global rules and standards on digital trade.</p><p>It could also serve as a pathfinder for similar future arrangements between the EU and ASEAN.</p><p>In a similar vein, I would also encourage Swedish companies to consider collaborating with the Singapore ecosystem.</p><p>Sweden has produced sustainability champions, both in terms of large corporates driving sustainability innovation and scale-ups deploying next-generation technologies.</p><p>In fact, I was at the EuroCham Sustainability Awards last month where the Swedish Chamber of Commerce here won the inaugural Green Initiative of the Year award, setting a positive example for other international business chambers.</p><p>Southeast Asia is a dynamic and high-growth region of more than 670 million people.</p><p>The region is projected to be the fourth-largest economy globally by 2030, driven by youthful demographics and a growing middle class. If you include India, then it is a combined market size of more than 2 billion.</p><p>As a regional business and finance hub, Singapore can be a base for Swedish businesses to connect with partners across Southeast Asia and the larger Asia-Pacific region, making the best use of trade, investment and intellectual property agreements that we have negotiated over the years.</p><p>For example, we are leveraging our strengths as an international financial centre and business hub to establish ourselves as a vibrant carbon services and trading hub. Carbon Impact X, a global carbon exchange and marketplace looking at the trading of carbon credits, is based in Singapore.</p><p>We welcome companies across the carbon market value chain to set up in Singapore and use us as a base to expand into the region which has huge potential for mitigation activities particularly in nature-based solutions.</p><p>I earlier mentioned MAS' activities in green and transition finance. Singapore is working with various stakeholders to develop and scale Asia-tailored transition finance solutions to capture transition opportunities.</p><p>To enable the new Singapore-Asia Taxonomy to facilitate cross-border green and transition financial flows, we have embarked on plans to enhance interoperability with the taxonomies of other geographies, including the EU.</p><p>We are keen to work with European partners, including from Sweden, to develop sustainability-related capabilities in Singapore and grow the range of sustainable finance solutions to serve clients in Asia.</p><p>As a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise, Singapore is also continually enhancing our R&amp;D ecosystem to offer partners a testbed for innovation and a gateway to scale new technologies across Asia.</p><p>Our Institutes of Higher Learning and research institutes are ready partners to industry.</p><p>Their deep capabilities and translational platforms can accelerate the translation of research into industry and market-relevant solutions.</p><p>I am also pleased to see our Institutes of Higher Learning deepen linkages with Swedish counterparts with an eye to enabling the green transition.</p><p>NTU, for example, will be collaborating with the Stockholm School of Economics, Minister Forsell's alma mater, to deliver its Executive Master of Science in Sustainability Management.</p><p>This will help to meet growing industry needs for expertise in sustainability management.</p><p>I hope that more universities on both sides can follow suit to forge similar collaborations.</p><p>Let me conclude. Since we established diplomatic relations in 1966, Singapore and Sweden have built up wide-ranging cooperation in defence, education, the environment, and research and development.</p><p>As we move forward to further enhance ties, tackling climate change and making the green transition are good opportunities to deepen our collaborations in the important area of innovation.</p><p>I wish you meaningful, productive, and constructive discussions for the rest of the Summit today.

Instead, the republic should invest in the region and serve as a knowledge hub for sustainability, says conservation scientist Professor Koh Lian Pin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Koh is director of the Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions (CNCS) at the National University of Singapore (NUS). In January, he took on an additional portfolio as policymaker, and currently serves as a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore's neighbours may hold the key to a greener world. Koh says Indonesia and Malaysia are among the top five countries in the world where the most carbon emissions can be avoided, simply by protecting their forests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are financial motivations as well, as these forests provide high-quality nature-based carbon offsets for the region. These will come to the fore with the launch of Climate Impact X (CIX), Singapore's global carbon exchange and marketplace, later this year.</p><p>The Asia Pacific has the highest concentration of the most profitable carbon projects, Koh adds, which can generate returns close to US$25 billion ($33.6 billion) in net present value each year for the next three decades. \"Indonesia alone can generate about US$10 billion per year, every year, for the next 30 years,\" he says.</p><p>At the CNCS, Koh and his fellow scientists work closely with both the public and private sectors to address the most urgent science and knowledge gaps. \"[We] improve the evidence base that helps inform our policies and business decisions on climate strategies and actions,\" says Koh.</p><p>On Sept 30, Temasek pledged $3 million to the NUS CNCS to implement a five-year research programme. The new NUS-Temasek Blue Carbon Project builds on nearly a decade of NUS research in measuring blue carbon, particularly in mangroves and sea grasses. Mangroves are one of the coastal ecosystems that have been identified to sequester and store more carbon per unit area than terrestrial forests.</p><p>Speaking at Temasek's Ecosperity Week 2021, Koh stressed that nature-based solutions - like protecting existing forests - are a scalable solution. \"We know that global carbon emissions are currently at about 40 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year. Our research shows that by protecting threatened forests across the tropics, we can avoid the loss of almost two billion tonnes of CO2 per year. This is greater than the emissions of Indonesia and Singapore combined.\"</p><p>By simply leaving forests untouched, the world can do more by doing less. Could this be more effective than spending millions on new equipment to placate our green guilt?</p><p>In an interview with The Edge Singapore, Koh points to the recent launch of the world's biggest carbon capture plant, which cost U$15 million and took 18 months to construct. Located in Iceland, the machine - named Orca - can trap and sequester 4,000 metric tonnes of CO2 per year.</p><p>That gas is mixed with water and the mixture is pumped into the volcanic basalt bedrock of Iceland to form calcium carbonate, otherwise known as limestone. Iceland is built upon relatively younger basalt - which is more porous - offering more space for carbon to fill.</p><p>It sounds impressive, until the penny drops: In a year, Orca will offset just three seconds' worth of global emissions. \"That is a hugely expensive machine, both financially and in terms of energy demand,\" says Koh. \"It is still very much a demonstration - a pilot project - and there are huge questions and uncertainties about scalability, whether we can actually scale it up to a level that will make any real difference.\"</p><p>\"Whether we invest in technological solutions or not, we still need to turn off the tap of emissions; from land use change, deforestation and forest degradation,\" he adds.</p><p>Singapore's green strategy</p><p>Koh brings 16 years of international research experience in sustainability and environmental science, having worked previously as a Swiss National Science Foundation Professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich - a public research university in the city of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland - as well as in Australia and the US.</p><p>Koh, who has a doctorate in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton University, returned to Singapore last year under the National Research Foundation's Returning Singaporean Scientists scheme for a homecoming of sorts - he joined the Department of Biological Sciences at NUS, where he did his bachelor's and master's in biological sciences.</p><p>When he was tapped to join Parliament late last year, Koh consulted with Dr Geh Min - former president of the Nature Society (Singapore) and NMP from 2005 to 2006 - who convinced him to accept the role.</p><p>\"My main motivation for accepting the nomination is to serve as a bridge between the government and the environmental community in Singapore,\" he says.</p><p>In July, the government walked back plans to raze Dover Forest for housing projects after conservation scientists highlighted the value of the 33ha site. Instead, public housing will only be launched in half the plot, for now.</p><p>\"That shows the government is taking the concerns and the opinions of the public very seriously, while also having to juggle different priorities,\" says Koh.</p><p>Such cases of competing uses of land in Singapore extends to our green strategy, says Koh. One example is the newly launched solar floating farm at Tengeh Reservoir. \"We have many other priorities; there's only so much we can do in terms of implementing nature-based solutions in Singapore.\"</p><p>For all the buzz over the Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm, the facility has its limitations too. Besides being land intensive, the other constraint is Singapore's persistent cloud cover, says Koh. \"The number of conducive daylight hours for maximum solar energy production can be quite limited, especially during certain parts of the year,\" says Koh.</p><p>One thing we have yet to learn is the potential environmental impact on the reservoir itself, he adds. \"There's always a trade-off.

We hope that all of you can join us in planting the trees, especially our children. We plant trees today, for the benefit of giving shade to the next generation.</p><p>Importance of Long-Term Planning</p><p>Let me say a bit more about long-term planning. The B2C route and other developments you see along Kallang River today are examples that demonstrate the way we plan in Singapore.</p><p>Decades ago, our early planners envisioned transforming the river and its surroundings into a highly liveable environment - one that not only catered to the needs of their time, but also for generations after them - for us and for our children.</p><p>By carefully stewarding our limited land and taking a long-term perspective, the plans were progressively brought to life over many decades - from paper, to reality on the ground. Today, diverse housing options, modern workplaces and green recreation spaces are meaningfully and sensitively interwoven to form vibrant neighbourhoods for residents, businesses, and the community.</p><p>It is this very same principle of stewardship - of planning ahead, thinking beyond our own immediate interests, and balancing the needs of our generation and the next - that we want to continue to embody, as we chart Singapore's future development.</p><p>This is especially critical as land pressures become increasingly acute and trade-offs harder to navigate. We must also find creative and innovative ways to optimise the use of land. This includes tapping underground spaces, co-locating multiple uses within a single space, and redeveloping brownfield sites, including residential estates. Such comprehensive redevelopment allows us to rejuvenate our estates and provide new housing opportunities for future generations.</p><p>Launch of the Draft Master Plan 2025 Conversations</p><p>With this in mind, I am now delighted to launch the public engagement for the Draft Master Plan 2025 today, where we will reach out to Singaporeans and invite you to join us in conversation. T his follows from the recent Long-Term Plan Review where we developed long-term strategies to guide Singapore's development over the next 50 years.</p><p>During those conversations as well as our Forward Singapore engagements, many Singaporeans have shared their aspirations for the Singapore of today and tomorrow and the values that they hold dear. These include accessible and affordable housing, good job opportunities for all, and a city that is sustainable, green, and anchored on a strong sense of identity.</p><p>In reviewing the Master Plan, we will translate the long-term strategies identified during the Long-Term Plan Review into detailed plans that we will implement on the ground and in your neighbourhood, over the next 10 to 15 years.</p><p>Over the next two years, we will reach out to stakeholders from all walks of life on the Draft Master Plan so that we can shape the future Singapore together.</p><p>With many competing needs as well as the increasingly diverse aspirations of Singaporeans, our choices on how we use our land may not necessarily meet everyone's expectations. But through the process of dialogue and conversation, of give and take, of thinking about what we need and what future generations need, and also trying to come up with win-win solutions, we hope both planners and members of public can better understand the range of different needs and interests, and how they can be appropriately accommodated within our small island city-state.</p><p>Shaping the future of Singapore</p><p>We propose to plan along four key themes.</p><p>First - 'Shaping a Happy Healthy City'. To build stronger communities and cater to diverse aspirations, we will be studying the possibility of developing a good mix of private and public housing in more central locations, which may include the city area, former Keppel golf course site, and Bukit Timah Turf City. We will also develop a Recreation Master Plan to see how we can make facilities and spaces more accessible in order to promote active lifestyles, ageing-in-place and a healthier population.</p><p>The second theme is, 'Strengthening Urban Resilience'. We will need to protect Singapore against the adverse effects of climate change, and respond more nimbly to crises and challenges. We will adopt technology and innovation, optimise existing spaces, and integrate nature-based solutions within our city infrastructure. We will tap on more underground spaces, and study how we can better protect our coastlines and enhance the heat resilience of our city. Because Singapore will not withstand the effects of climate change, and how well we protect Singaporeans and our city from climate change will define us into the future.</p><p>The third theme is, 'Enabling Sustainable Growth', we will focus on sustaining a thriving economy and meeting the needs of businesses and our workers. More flexible spaces and mixed-use sites will be injected into areas such as Jurong Lake District as well as other commercial nodes. We will also launch sites with different land tenures and different plot densities to meet the changing needs of our businesses and enterprises.</p><p>The final theme is 'Stewarding Nature &amp; Heritage'. Singaporeans cherish our biodiversity, our green spaces and natural environment, and desire to retain well-loved and familiar surroundings. Through identity corridors, like the Kallang River, which is part of the Thomson-Kallang Corridor, we will strengthen the distinctive character and heritage of our towns and our neighbourhoods. We will also continue to enhance our green and blue spaces to bring the benefits of nature closer to Singaporeans.</p><p>We will share more on these very exciting plans over the next year. In short, we completed the Long Term Plan Review, came up with broad themes and strategies for the next 50 years, and from today, we want to engage you on how to translate those bold ideas for the next 50 years onto the ground, into our neighbourhoods. So participate actively because we will work with you to plan for the rejuvenation of the places that we live, and you will be part of the conversations for the transformation of Singapore.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Later, we'll be doing tree planting. Over the years, the saplings that we will be planting will grow into tall trees. Singapore's transformation did not take place overnight. Today we enjoy the fruits of labour from those who came before us. They had the foresight to safeguard options for the future and made a lot of sacrifices, trade-offs and hard decisions during that time.</p><p>In that same spirit, let us work together to create the Draft Master Plan 2025, not just for ourselves, but also for our children. We are always thinking of them, and the children who come after them. We want to hear your views and ideas, and discuss them constructively to make Singapore a more liveable, inclusive, and endearing home.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Transportation Infrastructure, Highways &amp; Railtracks, Business Expansion, Events]</p><p>Source: Urban Redevelopment Authority, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["The second theme is, 'Strengthening Urban Resilience'.

Songbirds and dragonflies flitting about.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But the picture is in full colour and the setting is not a kampung, but prime residential land.</p><p> The bungalow sits on 30,000 sq ft of land in Bukit Timah. </p><p> The fish are growing in the swimming pool. In keeping with the times, a chef comes in twice a week to cook for private-dining guests, using vegetables, herbs and flowers from the farm.</p><p> For about a year, Abundant Cities, a natural science and research experimentation company and consultancy, has been farming on about 15,000 sq ft of the land. </p><p> It worked with Habitat Collective, which champions small-scale agriculture, to design the farm around sustainable and ecologically sound principles.</p><p> Ms Sarah Lewis, 38, chief executive of Abundant Cities, says the farm collects rainwater to irrigate the crops, the chickens turn food scraps into compost for the soil, a biofilter keeps the swimming pool clean using plants and beneficial microbes, and the farm attracts bees that pollinate the plants.</p><p> Groups of volunteers come in to work on the farm, some with kids in tow. At the end of the session, they sit down to a meal made with the produce they helped to nurture and grow.</p><p> \"A lot of people say this is like kampung life,\" she says. \"Without any prompting, many of them say this is a healing space.\" </p><p> Ms Lewis adds that the home owner, who lives in the house but declines to be named or interviewed, believes in this way of farming. She wants her young children to experience what it is like to grow, harvest and eat the food they help to produce.</p><p> Among the crops in the farm are Alabama Red Okra, heirloom brinjals, green beans, spinach, ginger, taro and tapioca; fruit such as papaya and coconut; and herbs and flowers such as ulam raja, sawtooth coriander, Mexican tarragon, sorrel, marigolds, hibiscus and roselle. </p><p> The farm puts out about 50kg of produce a month, which supplements the diet for about 15 families. Ms Lewis, a Briton and Singapore permanent resident, is aiming for the farm to produce 150kg a month eventually.</p><p> The chickens are put to good use -- and not for eating. They turn food scraps from food and fruit stalls, and spent grain from breweries, into compost for the soil. </p><p> Volunteers and private-dining guests get to enjoy the eggs the chickens produce.</p><p> The pool is filled with guppies and a freshwater fish known as Tinfoil Barb (right). The fish feed on mosquito larvae, keeping the mosquito population in check, and the larger fish feed on the guppies.</p><p> Weekly tests are done on the water, the mosquito population is tracked weekly and the soil is tested every quarter to make sure the ecological system is safe and sound.</p><p> Twice a week, chef Tse Shu Chun -- who has worked at Fat Lulu's, Moosehead Kitchen-Bar, Restaurant Labyrinth and Restaurant Zen -- cooks for groups of between eight and 12. </p><p> Meals are priced at $220 a person, with at least eight or nine courses. The 36-year-old goes by word of mouth and people can book dinners via his Instagram account, @lepetitefire.</p><p> He runs a tight, no-waste ship. \"Having worked in restaurants, I realise we waste a lot of food. When I started cooking in people's homes and doing private dining, I was able to cut down on that. The trimmings feed me and my family,\" he says.</p><p> \"Poultry suppliers say they throw away innards and parts like necks, or give them to pet food and composting companies. But they are perfectly delicious.\"</p><p> As a result, he might make duck neck sausages and serve grilled duck hearts. </p><p> And the rustic vibe of the farm informs the way he prepares the food -- most of it is cooked over charcoal.</p><p> Because chef Tse is cooking on a small scale, he can serve cuts, such as beef shortribs, which require long cooking -- something that a busy restaurant kitchen, with limited storage space, might not want to do. </p><p> He also has access to produce from the farm. The heirloom brinjals go on the grill, and are served with housemade tofu and ponzu sauce. Grilled Alabama Red Okra is paired with garlic chilli crisp.</p><p>Mexican tarragon from the farm goes into making a parfait, slices of which are stuffed into Japanese wafers called monaka, then studded with marigold and ulam raja petals he harvests. </p><p> This last course in the meal has a purpose too -- the carotenoids in tarragon are said to aid digestion. \"I am doing food that is more thoughtful,\" he says.</p><p> The farm is also open to small groups of visitors. Abundant Cities is working with Wow Kampung -- a group that designs learning experiences for pupils, students, teachers and corporate groups -- on sustainability-themed programmes for pre-schoolers.</p><p> Ms Lewis says: \"We manage the natural resources here using nature-based solutions. Then we have people come in and disrupt the natural system that we have set up in this urban context to see if it is resilient.\" </p><p> She calls the home farm a \"proof of concept\" project, and hopes to replicate it in other homes and possibly public parks. </p><p> Abundant Cities is also looking to support the residents of Housing Board flats to grow edible plants on their balconies and in corridors.</p><p> Ms Carrie Tan, an MP of Nee Soon GRC, visited the farm earlier in 2023 and found it educational. </p><p> She visited again soon after -- this time with representatives from the Nee Soon Town Council, Nee Soon South grassroots organisations, community gardeners and National Parks Board staff -- to learn more about the farming practices.</p><p> She says she will continue to refer groups of community volunteers from her constituency to attend learning sessions at the farm, find out more about the practices and facilitate similar projects in Nee Soon South.</p><p> \"I thought it was very good to have met people so passionate about ecologically sustainable farming,\" she says. </p><p> \"It's not just about the farming techniques, but also fostering a sense of community ownership to drive a project like that together.\" </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The farm is also open to small groups of visitors.

The key is to make sense of how industries and companies will need to shift, adapt, and invest in solutions to aid the transition.

You cannot think in terms of typical industrial clusters. You need to think about system changes.''</p><p> LO has identified three system changes -- electrification; nature; and a focus on materials, mandating a shift away from a linear \"make-take-waste'' economic model towards a circular economy where reduce, reuse and recycling are the norm. </p><p> \"We translate these system changes into transition roadmaps. We try to model the capex and understand how profit pools will shift. Then we connect the profit pools to investment opportunities. You'll be able to find names that will generate that green alpha.''</p><p> He believes nature will emerge as an asset class. \"Nature is the most underpriced asset today, and it's critical for our needs. Nature absorbs more than 20 gigatons of carbon every year. The day we start putting a price on it, it will become a big asset class.'' </p><p> LO intends to roll out a \"nature-based'' offering for institutions later this year. It has also planned strategies reflecting the system changes. Last year Lombard Odier Investment Managers tied up with the Alliance to End Plastic Waste to raise US$500 million for a private equity circular plastic fund, investing in solutions for plastic waste collection, recycling and technology to improve plastic durability and recyclability. The first round of fundraising has closed.</p><p> BlackRock's Emily Woodland, Apac head of sustainable and transition solutions, says transition investing has three drivers -- innovation, government policy, and consumer and investor preferences. Transition isn't a linear process, she says.</p><p> \"We expect it to be a multi-speed transition between different regions and sectors, based on the costs and availability and cost of capital.'' BlackRock has rolled out a transition investing platform with US$100 billion in assets, including public market portfolios, private market funds and transition deals.</p><p> Companies that are aligning their business models with decarbonisation, in industries such as metals, utilities and mobility, \"could offer some of the most attractive investment opportunities''. The strategies include a \"brown to green'' materials strategy, investing in undervalued carbon-intensive companies that produce the raw materials and products driving the low-carbon transition. </p><p> Private banks say the concept of natural capital finds a ready ear among clients. Mario Knoepfel, UBS head of sustainable investing advisory Asia-Pacific, notes a growing interest in the issues of biodiversity and natural capital. \"We've seen increased focus on nature-based solutions (NBS) to generate returns for the planet, people and profits. While NBS was traditionally seen as an area for philanthropy, technological and financial innovations are beginning to unlock the scalability and accessibility of these projects to commercial-rate investors.''</p><p> DBS Private Bank's Marc Lansonneur, head of managed solutions and investment governance, said the bank is \"heartened to see more clients rethinking their role in society, and how they can best play their part''. \"Climate-related thematics such as decarbonisation, net zero, renewable energy especially, are topics that clients -- who are business owners themselves -- also look at in their day-to-day business operations that will bear more measurable impact.''</p><p> ESG-plusMeanwhile asset managers strive to go beyond standard ESG measurement to eke out value. Here are some highlights:</p><p> Fidelity International: The firm focuses on the principle of \"double materiality\". Single materiality focuses on the ESG risks and downside that may hit a company's bottom line. Ellie Tang, the firm's director for sustainable investing says: \"Double materiality looks at these risks and also at how a company is positively contributing to the environment and society.\" </p><p> \"This inside-out and outside-in view allows us to understand how a company's sustainability performance would look like in the longer term. Coupled with engagement and good communication with investee companies, we get a 360-degree view of companies and their abilities to translate strategy into implementation.''</p><p> Schroders: Mervyn Tang, head of sustainability strategy (Apac), says analysis of climate transition risk involves getting a handle on the challenges businesses face as they move towards a low-carbon regime. Carbon intensity provides insight, but only partially. \"Some companies may have more pricing power, allowing them to pass higher carbon costs to their customers.''</p><p> He notes the growing sophistication of sustainable investment themes, such as circular economy, biodiversity and active ownership. \"Central to this evolution is measurement. We're enhancing our methods to quantify the engagement progress and impact. The more we measure, the more transparency we can provide, which mitigates the risk of greenwashing.''</p><p> Wellington Management: Wendy Cromwell, the firm's head of sustainable investment, says some market inefficiencies support the case for sustainable investing as a source of alpha. These include an excessive focus on short term growth and inconsistent and backward-looking third-party ratings. \"Most climate analysis focus on mitigation, rather than adaptation. By focusing on the latter, managers can identify winners that will stand a better chance of thriving in a new climate paradigm.''</p><p> BNP Paribas Asset Management: Crystal Geng, Asia ESG research lead, says the firm's methodology is \"markedly differentiated, with a more focused number of ESG metrics and a clear preference for 'performance' over 'policy' indicators\". For industries and retail, for instance, the firm looks into indicators for worker mortality rate, accident rate and turnover, instead of just relying on a company's health and safety policy.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Private banks say the concept of natural capital finds a ready ear among clients.

The most promising investments may well be found in private markets, via venture capital or private equity.Porcherot says: \"You need to have a critical view of the changes in operating models that corporates will implement over the 20 to 30 years. You cannot think in terms of typical industrial clusters. You need to think about system changes.''LO has identified three system changes - electrification; nature; and a focus on materials, mandating a shift away from a linear \"make-take-waste'' economic model towards a circular economy where reduce, reuse and recycling are the norm. \"We translate these system changes into transition roadmaps. We try to model the capex and understand how profit pools will shift. Then we connect the profit pools to investment opportunities. You'll be able to find names that will generate that green alpha.''He believes nature will emerge as an asset class. \"Nature is the most underpriced asset today, and it's critical for our needs. Nature absorbs more than 20 gigatons of carbon every year. The day we start putting a price on it, it will become a big asset class.'' LO intends to roll out a \"nature-based'' offering for institutions later this year. It has also planned strategies reflecting the system changes. Last year Lombard Odier Investment Managers tied up with the Alliance to End Plastic Waste to raise US$500 million for a private equity circular plastic fund, investing in solutions for plastic waste collection, recycling and technology to improve plastic durability and recyclability. The first round of fundraising has closed.BlackRock's Emily Woodland, Apac head of sustainable and transition solutions, says transition investing has three drivers - innovation, government policy, and consumer and investor preferences. Transition isn't a linear process, she says.\"We expect it to be a multi-speed transition between different regions and sectors, based on the costs and availability and cost of capital.'' BlackRock has rolled out a transition investing platform with US$100 billion in assets, including public market portfolios, private market funds and transition deals.Companies that are aligning their business models with decarbonisation, in industries such as metals, utilities and mobility, \"could offer some of the most attractive investment opportunities''. The strategies include a \"brown to green'' materials strategy, investing in undervalued carbon-intensive companies that produce the raw materials and products driving the low-carbon transition. Private banks say the concept of natural capital finds a ready ear among clients. Mario Knoepfel, UBS head of sustainable investing advisory Asia-Pacific, notes a growing interest in the issues of biodiversity and natural capital. \"We've seen increased focus on nature-based solutions (NBS) to generate returns for the planet, people and profits. While NBS was traditionally seen as an area for philanthropy, technological and financial innovations are beginning to unlock the scalability and accessibility of these projects to commercial-rate investors.''DBS Private Bank's Marc Lansonneur, head of managed solutions and investment governance, said the bank is \"heartened to see more clients rethinking their role in society, and how they can best play their part''. \"Climate-related thematics such as decarbonisation, net zero, renewable energy especially, are topics that clients - who are business owners themselves - also look at in their day-to-day business operations that will bear more measurable impact.''ESG-plusMeanwhile asset managers strive to go beyond standard ESG measurement to eke out value. Here are some highlights:Fidelity International: The firm focuses on the principle of \"double materiality\". Single materiality focuses on the ESG risks and downside that may hit a company's bottom line. Ellie Tang, the firm's director for sustainable investing says: \"Double materiality looks at these risks and also at how a company is positively contributing to the environment and society.\" \"This inside-out and outside-in view allows us to understand how a company's sustainability performance would look like in the longer term. Coupled with engagement and good communication with investee companies, we get a 360-degree view of companies and their abilities to translate strategy into implementation.''Schroders: Mervyn Tang, head of sustainability strategy (Apac), says analysis of climate transition risk involves getting a handle on the challenges businesses face as they move towards a low-carbon regime. Carbon intensity provides insight, but only partially. \"Some companies may have more pricing power, allowing them to pass higher carbon costs to their customers.''He notes the growing sophistication of sustainable investment themes, such as circular economy, biodiversity and active ownership. \"Central to this evolution is measurement. We're enhancing our methods to quantify the engagement progress and impact. The more we measure, the more transparency we can provide, which mitigates the risk of greenwashing.''Wellington Management: Wendy Cromwell, the firm's head of sustainable investment, says some market inefficiencies support the case for sustainable investing as a source of alpha. These include an excessive focus on short term growth and inconsistent and backward-looking third-party ratings. \"Most climate analysis focus on mitigation, rather than adaptation. By focusing on the latter, managers can identify winners that will stand a better chance of thriving in a new climate paradigm.''BNP Paribas Asset Management: Crystal Geng, Asia ESG research lead, says the firm's methodology is \"markedly differentiated, with a more focused number of ESG metrics and a clear preference for 'performance' over 'policy' indicators\". For industries and retail, for instance, the firm looks into indicators for worker mortality rate, accident rate and turnover, instead of just relying on a company's health and safety policy.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Private banks say the concept of natural capital finds a ready ear among clients.

In a review of lending policies, banks in the region performed the worst when it came to restricting the negative impact on biodiversity,\" Williams says.</p><p> \u00b7 EnablementStakeholders such as governments, financial institutions and support services in the region can be enablers for change - and will have much to gain from having such a marketplace housed and headquartered here.</p><p> \"As an important global financial hub, financial institutions in Asia Pacific must proactively manage flows of capital towards nature-positive outcomes. As nature has underpinned economic growth in the region for decades, ensuring that nature is responsibly managed and restored also presents some attractive opportunities,\" Williams said.</p><p> For example, Deloitte and WWF-Australia's report cited a study co-authored by Temasek, which found that investing in just 59 nature-positive business opportunities in the region could generate US$4.3 trillion and 232 million jobs annually by 2030 -- equivalent to 14 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the region. </p><p> \"We firmly believe this should not just be about divesting away from financing activities that enable a harmful impact on nature, but also about investing deeper into activities that have a positive impact,\" said Williams. </p><p> This could include nature-themed funds that invest in natural capital projects such as nature-based solutions and agro-forestry, or solutions that reduce negative impact on nature, such as circular production models and alternative proteins, he added.

Any company or individual can purchase carbon credits to offset their own carbon footprint voluntarily.</p><p>In our journey towards a greener world, voluntary carbon markets are expected to play a more impactful role.</p><p>* First, the voluntary market can cater to a wider group of firms and individuals.</p><p>- Emissions trading systems tend to cover sectors with higher emissions and so not all firms participate in the compliance carbon market.</p><p>* Second, firms which are already covered in emissions trading systems can tap on the voluntary carbon market to decarbonise further, going beyond their mandatory targets.</p><p>There is great opportunity to scale the voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>* Globally, the demand for voluntary carbon credits is expected to grow 15-fold over the next 10 years, to 2 billion tonnes in 2030.</p><p>* More governments and companies are committing to net-zero targets.</p><p>- Last year, 1,500 companies across the world made net-zero commitments, a three-fold increase from the year before.</p><p>- This number will continue to grow rapidly.</p><p>There is also greater international impetus for growing the voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>* The Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, sponsored by the Institute for International Finance, has set out 20 recommendations for building trusted and well-functioning markets for voluntary carbon credits.</p><p>Climate Impact X</p><p>This is why today's announcement of Climate Impact X, or CIX, is significant.</p><p>CIX is a visionary idea for a global carbon exchange and marketplace anchored out of Asia, centred on trust and innovation.</p><p>* It is an initiative borne out of the Alliance for Action on Sustainability under the Emerging Stronger Taskforce</p><p>* The Sustainability Alliance proposed to develop an Asian voluntary carbon credit market, and I am happy to see more partners coming together to take forward this meaningful work.</p><p>CIX is a promising solution to the problem we face today of fragmented carbon credit markets characterised by thin liquidity and credits of questionable quality.</p><p>CIX can be a test bed for the recommendations of the Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets.</p><p>* Example: the recommendation to create mechanisms for signalling demand.</p><p>- CIX is forming a coalition of buyers and sellers committed to high quality credits.</p><p>- This will provide suppliers the confidence to scale up supply and catalyse the development of the carbon market.</p><p>* If CIX can demonstrate the effectiveness of the recommendations of the Taskforce, it will build strong momentum for effective carbon credits markets globally.</p><p>Let me highlight two significant features of CIX:</p><p>* first, the focus on carbon credits generated through nature-based solutions; and</p><p>* second, the use of technology to ensure a transparent and verifiable carbon market.</p><p>Nature-based solutions are measures taken to protect, sustainably manage, and restore ecosystems.</p><p>* Examples include reforestation, and restoring peatlands and mangroves.</p><p>* It is estimated that nature-based solutions can provide more than 30% of the climate mitigation needed globally by 2030.</p><p>* Yet, such solutions currently only account for 2% of climate funding.</p><p>Nature-based solutions are an attractive proposition.</p><p>* They not only green the world, but provide social and economic benefits that make it a better place to live in.</p><p>* Take for example the restoration of mangroves.</p><p>- Mangroves not only save carbon emissions but also serve as a natural barrier against floods and support biodiversity.</p><p>Trust is a critical ingredient for any successful marketplace.

In recent weeks, air quality in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia has been poor and over the weekend, Singapore's readings hit the unhealthy range for the first time since 2019. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The haze has recurred frequently since the severe fires of 1997, but a recent interregnum of blue skies lulled many into thinking the problem was resolved. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In June 2023, the annual Haze Outlook issued by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) sounded a \"red\" alarm about the risk of severe haze returning. At that time, the weather was still wetter than normal. But a major factor shaping the assessment was indeed the variable weather. The intersection of El Nino and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, where sea temperature changes affect air pressures over the Pacific and Indian Oceans, is deepening and extending the dry season.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SIIA sounded that alarm to call attention and nudge governments and companies to make preparations. In recent weeks, SIIA has also engaged officials, corporations and experts in countries key to the issue -- Indonesia and Malaysia. </p><p> The unhelpful blame gameWho is to blame? Some are already pointing fingers. Malaysia's Minister of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Nik Nazmi blamed the haze hitting his country on fires from beyond his borders. The Indonesian authorities have rebutted this and suggested that problems stem from companies controlled by Malaysians. Among companies with plantation holdings, most are silent or point the finger to smallholders clearing land through fires that then run out of control. </p><p> The Indonesian authorities are now taking action -- not only in firefighting and disaster management, but also in investigating suspects and employing an array of legal sanctions. Last week, Indonesian officials announced they are preparing legal action, including bringing possible criminal charges against 11 companies in Sumatra that had fires on their land. </p><p> These companies hold sizeable properties in areas that can impact Singapore and Malaysia with haze, given wind patterns. Within Sumatra, the provinces of Jambi and South Sumatra have seen the most fires in 2023. More companies are being investigated in Kalimantan and other fire-prone areas. In total, over 200 companies have been warned.</p><p> Even before this, the Jokowi administration has given attention to the issue and taken unprecedented efforts. These include a permanent moratorium on granting new permits for businesses to clear primary forest and peatland and creating Manggala Agni, a nationwide fire brigade that also trains local police and fire rangers.</p><p>Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry has been enlarged and empowered. Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar, who is in charge of the ministry, has served both terms of the Jokowi administration and is acknowledged to be effective and willing to take on companies and others to achieve her goals.</p><p> On the basis of these and other reforms, President Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, declared the end of fires and haze to be one of the legacies of his time in office.  </p><p> It is clear the Jokowi government has done more than any earlier Indonesian government. But it is just as clear that these efforts are insufficient to fully resolve the problem. </p><p> We should acknowledge the dominant factor that has changed in 2023: the weather. Yet, this acknowledgement cannot be a blanket excuse for inaction. </p><p> Tackle haze nowIt is wrong to see the haze as a short-lived nuisance. </p><p> In previous haze years, fires peaked in September, clearing up by October with monsoon rains. But meteorologists are warning that with El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole, dry conditions will likely persist into late October or even November and fire risks will continue. </p><p> Moreover, these weather phenomena often extend across multiple years. Climate change may also reduce the interval between these events. </p><p> The challenge of fighting fires is real and must be an ongoing concern, with an eye on underlying factors in the resource and agribusiness sectors and another on how the haze worsens the impact of Indonesia's carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.</p><p> The political climate in Indonesia is also changing. Most immediately, with the upcoming general election to form the next Indonesian government, some local officials tend to relent on strict enforcement in order to court votes. There are already reports of some provinces  giving more attention to the issue than others. </p><p> For the longer term too, as a leadership change looms, it is unclear if the next president will do as much or more than the current administration. The economic and resource politics of Indonesia may evolve again -- for example, if the next government allows plantation operators to expand and clear more land. There are gaps to be addressed going forward to both mitigate the outbreaks of fires and to provide incentives for sustainability. </p><p> Although Mr Widodo's term is ending, political attention and will must be asserted to confront the current issues, if indeed this is to be an enduring legacy of his presidency that will endure. </p><p> Private sector action Consider firefighting, a key response capability. Mr Widodo has once again mobilised the police and military to assist in firefighting, an important signal that he is taking matters seriously. But in many parts of Indonesia, the majority of firefighting capacity is in the hands of the private sector, not local governments.  </p><p> Companies know they can be blamed for fires on their land, even ones they did not start, and most respond to fires within a 5km radius of their concessions as a condition of holding a business licence. Some are prepared to go further and help local communities be fire-free, with the support of local authorities. </p><p> Conservation and ecosystem restoration must be ramped up. This is especially needed for peatlands, which are wet in their natural state but can release the heaviest sooty haze and the most carbon when they are drained and burnt. </p><p> Created by Mr Widodo in 2016, the Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency has rewetted some 1.5 million ha of peat in public land -- an area more than 20 times the size of Singapore. Additionally, companies have undertaken rewetting initiatives on nearly 3.7 million ha of peatland under an initiative supervised by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Such efforts are reported to reduce fire outbreak within rewetted boundaries. </p><p> But while significant ground has been covered, Indonesia is home to over 20 million ha of peatland and some estimates suggest that around half that area is in need of rehabilitation. There are also non-peat forest areas prone to fire that could benefit from conservation. Such a vast scale suggests government action cannot succeed on its own. </p><p> Local communities should be involved. Government agencies and several companies are currently helping villages by providing assistance and incentives to keep themselves fire-free. The lack of alternatives and income insecurity are what often drives farmers to use fire. These efforts should be further encouraged and supported to ensure that livelihoods are secured in tandem with sustainability efforts.</p><p> Some companies are going further, pledging to conserve carbon- and biodiversity-rich areas within their concession boundaries. This is commendable but needs support. The business licensing system in Indonesia should be flexible enough to allow companies to commercialise such projects and allow them to generate and sell carbon credits. This would provide stronger financial incentives to safeguard such areas against fires and degradation. </p><p> But even as incentives are needed, so too are the right forms of pressure to instil responsibility.</p><p> Investigations and prosecutions are the clearest forms of deterrence. After all, while dry conditions make matters worse, the vast majority of fires are human-started. Indonesian officials need to keep a keen and fair eye on the ground, cooperating with helpful companies and singling out the recalcitrant.</p><p> Over the past three years, Indonesia has also conducted audits of plantation sectors, searching for corruption and abuses. Further action is expected in the remaining months of the present government's term to follow up on its governance push.</p><p> Can others help? The Indonesian authorities may seem sensitive to criticism and zealous over sovereignty issues, but there is a case for more transparency, dialogue, and cooperation. In policing corporations, investigations may uncover investment, trade, and finance links to Malaysia and Singapore. If there is a request from Indonesia backed up by credible evidence, governments should cooperate for cross-border enforcement. </p><p> There are also wider links to climate change. In an ordinary year, forestry and other land use accounts for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of Indonesia's annual emissions. In a severe haze year, the emissions from fires and the forestry sector can exceed the emissions from all other sectors combined. Stemming fires and preventing their recurrence could provide the basis for win-win cooperation on ecosystem conservation, including international investment in nature-based solutions and carbon credits. </p><p> In September, Indonesia launched its first carbon emissions trading market. While now focused on the power sector, Indonesia hopes to introduce a carbon tax in the future and encourage the wider buying and selling of carbon credits, including ones from forest conservation projects. Indonesia therefore has an incentive to keep carbon sequestered in its forests and be trusted to do so, rather than allowing trees and peat to burn. </p><p> At the regional level, Asean can play a supporting role. The grouping recently reached a final agreement to establish a permanent Asean Coordinating Centre for Transboundary Haze Pollution Control in Indonesia. It should facilitate better information sharing on haze situations, working with the existing Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre. The grouping is also rolling out a new haze-free road map for 2023 to 2030, along with an investment framework to support haze prevention projects. </p><p> There is also much to be done by the private sector outside of Indonesia. Increasingly, supply chains are subject to intense scrutiny, especially by developed markets and investors. Traders and financial institutions must map this sector more carefully to understand where the risks are and where efforts can be applied to improve practices. </p><p> The 2023 haze we have seen is not as severe as past instances. But unless actions are stepped up and then continued by the next government, the coming years could stain the efforts of the last decade and Mr Widodo's legacy, leaving a darker grey in the skies. </p><p> Associate Professor Simon Tay is chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, where  Ms Khor Yu-Leng and Mr Aaron Choo are respectively associate director and senior assistant director (special projects and sustainability). </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["In an ordinary year, forestry and other land use accounts for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of Indonesia's annual emissions.

It is a pleasure to join you today at the EuroCham Sustainability Awards 2023 to celebrate companies and organisations in Singapore for their outstanding sustainability efforts.</p><p>The EU-Singapore Story</p><p>For more than 20 years, EuroCham has helped to promote closer and stronger business, trade and investment linkages between the EU and Singapore as well as between the EU and ASEAN.</p><p>This underscores the EU's like-mindedness with Singapore on the importance of an open, inter-connected and integrated global economic system.</p><p>Indeed, European companies and individuals have played a constructive role in Singapore's development story.</p><p>Mr Rubbert earlier mentioned Mr Albert Winsemius. Mr Winsemius was one such individual from Europe who played an important role in the early stages of our economic development.</p><p>In our early years of independence, European companies like Siemens and Safran made significant investments into Singapore, creating many meaningful jobs, imparting skills and knowledge, and uplifting the lives and livelihoods of our people.</p><p>In fact, we used to have three training centres in Singapore - the German-Singapore Training Institute, the French-Singapore Training Institute and the Japan-Singapore Training Institute.</p><p>These three institutes later merged to form the Nanyang Polytechnic.</p><p>Today, the EU and Singapore have established a wide-ranging partnership spanning culture, science, education and research, defence, and healthcare, among others.</p><p>Singapore is the EU's largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN. Ambassador Piorko earlier mentioned the EU's extensive links with other countries in ASEAN. Many EU businesses based in Singapore also tap on us as a base to access the ASEAN market.</p><p>The EU is Singapore's 5th largest goods trading partner and more than 12,000 European companies have established a presence here.</p><p>Many of these companies are pursuing cutting-edge advances in areas like aviation and electronics, including in collaboration with our universities and research institutes, that will help both Singapore and the EU build more resilient, vibrant, and future-ready economies.</p><p>The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which entered into force in 2019, is the first such Free Trade Agreement between the EU and an ASEAN country.</p><p>Building on our strong economic links, the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement is helping to unlock opportunities for collaboration in new and emerging areas, positioning both the EU and Singapore well to tackle common challenges together.</p><p>The Green Chapter</p><p>Foremost among these shared challenges is climate change.</p><p>A changing climate knows no boundaries. Its impacts are felt globally, transcending geographical boundaries.</p><p>Europe saw one of its warmest summers in 2023, with record temperatures of 48.8 degrees Celsius in some areas.</p><p>Singapore, too, experienced its highest recorded temperature of 37 degrees Celsius in May this year.</p><p>Global warming intensifies extreme weather events and could trigger broader social and economic disruptions.</p><p>It also affects our biodiversity system in a very significant way and affects our food resilience. So climate action should be more than just a priority - rather, it is essential for our survival.</p><p>As signatories to the UN Paris Agreement, both Singapore and the EU are strongly committed to tackling climate change.</p><p>The EU was one of the co-leads for the Global Methane Pledge, which was launched to catalyse action to reduce methane emissions. Singapore is among the more than 110 countries to have signed the Pledge.</p><p>Singapore also co-facilitated ministerial consultations on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement at COP-26, which saw the finalisation of the rule book on carbon credits and carbon markets.</p><p>This reflects our commitment to enabling high integrity carbon markets that would help unlock more mitigation action and contribute to accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Within the EU, as Ambassador Piorko mentioned earlier, the European Green Deal details your ambitious plans to make the European continent, the first continent, carbon-neutral by 2050.</p><p>On our part, Singapore has also committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and for the public sector by 2045.</p><p>Our Singapore Green Plan 2030 charts ambitious and concrete targets to advance our national agenda on sustainable development. We are making significant progress in accelerating the green transition throughout our society and economy.</p><p>In 2019, Singapore became the first country in Southeast Asia to implement a carbon tax.</p><p>We are raising this progressively in stages until 2030, to strengthen the price signal and impetus for businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p>We are undertaking major research on urban solutions and sustainability - how do we make a city that is densely populated smart, green and sustainable? And this covers a whole range of work on the energy transition, on the use of renewables, recycling, and reducing waste.</p><p>Our carbon pricing trajectory will enhance the business case to invest in low-carbon solutions, helping businesses remain competitive in a low-carbon future.</p><p>The revenue collected from the carbon tax will be used to support decarbonisation efforts and the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as cushion the impact on businesses and consumers.</p><p>We have also boosted the adoption of electric vehicles and accelerated the transition of the use of cleaner and lower-carbon fuels for our maritime and aviation sectors.</p><p>In addition, we have granted conditional approvals to import around 4 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035 to decarbonise our power sector.</p><p>And we are also working with our regional neighbours to develop an ASEAN Power Grid to facilitate regional decarbonisation and improve energy security.</p><p>The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement gives Singapore and the EU a solid framework to advance our joint sustainability and development agenda.</p><p>It is a high standard and comprehensive agreement, which would eliminate tariffs on all products traded between us by end-2024. This includes tariffs on important green goods and services.</p><p>Under the agreement, both sides have also committed to resolve non-tariff barriers, including for renewable energy generation.</p><p>In addition, many innovative green technologies are valuable forms of intellectual property and soft assets that would be well protected under the EU- Singapore Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>Alongside cooperation with the EU, Singapore has also embarked on several joint green initiatives with our European partners.</p><p>In 2022, Singapore launched a Digital and Green Partnership with France and a Framework for Sustainability and Innovation with Germany. These initiatives provide a structured platform for cooperation on digital and green priorities including sustainable heritage conservation and green technologies.</p><p>As Ambassador Piorko earlier mentioned, the green and digital transformations are deeply interlinked. To enable zero or near-zero greenhouse gas emission shipping, Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority has worked with the Port of Rotterdam and 22 value-chain stakeholders to operationalise the Singapore- Rotterdam Green and Digital Shipping Corridor.</p><p>10. I am confident that our robust and wide-ranging green economy collaboration, including between our regions, will continue to grow from strength to strength.</p><p>The Role of Businesses</p><p>Let me now touch on the role of businesses. Singapore and European businesses can seize new growth opportunities together, while contributing to the two regions' sustainability goals.</p><p>Southeast Asia is home to some of the world's fastest growing cities, with a large youth population and a rapidly growing middle class.</p><p>There is potential to pursue emissions reduction while generating new growth opportunities as we shift to a greener economy.</p><p>To unlock this potential, all stakeholders including government and businesses need to make a concerted effort.</p><p>The private sector too plays a pivotal role in achieving the region's sustainability goals, including through uplifting Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) standards in the way you trade, invest and do business.</p><p>Let me highlight three promising areas where the private sector, including European businesses, can help catalyse decarbonisation at scale for the region.</p><p>First, carbon markets.</p><p>Singapore is leveraging our strengths as an international financial centre and business hub to establish ourselves as a vibrant carbon services and trading hub.</p><p>We welcome companies across the carbon market value chain to set up in Singapore, and use Singapore as a base to expand into the region which has huge potential for mitigation activities particularly in nature-based solutions.</p><p>Today, Singapore is home to more than 100 companies that tap on Singapore as a regional gateway to provide carbon services in Asia.</p><p>This includes key players such as Climate Action Data Trust, a global platform aimed at enhancing the transparency of carbon markets by integrating data from project registries.</p><p>Second, low carbon solutions.</p><p>We are investing in low-carbon technologies such as low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage, which can enable our transition to a net zero future.</p><p>The energy transition, in particular, is a prime area for new scientific and technological breakthroughs. R&amp;D, including into low-carbon solutions and new digital solutions, can help us lower our carbon footprint and raise energy efficiencies.</p><p>Given the scale of the task before us, global collaborations across borders and regions will be essential to accelerate our progress in building a greener world.</p><p>Third, green and transition finance.</p><p>As an international financial centre, Singapore plays an important role in supporting Asia's transition to a green and net-zero future.</p><p>In April this year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched a Finance for Net Zero (FiNZ) Action Plan laying out strategies to mobilise financing to catalyse Asia's net zero transition and decarbonisation activities in Singapore and the region.</p><p>We are working with various stakeholders to develop and scale Asia-tailored transition finance solutions and markets to capture transition opportunities, including scaling blended finance for transition projects with public, private and philanthropic partnerships.</p><p>As part of this, MAS is working with partners to develop regional taxonomies that can provide clarity to the market on what activities can be considered green or transition, thereby helping to unlock and scale up green and transition finance.</p><p>We are keen to work with European partners in developing sustainability-related capabilities in Singapore and growing the range of sustainable finance solutions to serve clients in Asia.</p><p>As a regional business hub, Singapore can be a base for European businesses to connect with partners across Southeast Asia and the larger Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>We can also serve as a living laboratory for innovative European businesses to test-bed novel solutions that can be scaled up regionally for wider impact.</p><p>In June 2023, Schneider Electric opened a Sustainability Competency Centre (SCC) for Asia in Singapore, in partnership with the Singapore Economic Development Board.</p><p>The SCC would anchor Singapore as a global hub for sustainability leadership development and to develop and deliver sustainability services and solutions for the region.</p><p>Singapore is also pioneering the development of new rules and standards through Green Economy Agreements.</p><p>This can allow companies based in Singapore to connect with green economy markets overseas.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The EuroCham Sustainability Awards 2023 is a testament to the strong and growing partnership between Europe and Singapore. It also reflects the invaluable commitment from the private sector towards achieving sustainability goals.</p><p>In recognising companies and organisations for their accomplishments in social sustainability, sustainable investments and supply chains, and business innovations, EuroCham is helping to steer the interest of industry and partners onto a path towards greater sustainability.</p><p>Let me also commend the award finalists this evening for being good role models of how enterprises and organisations can support efforts toward a greener, more sustainable future. I am sure your work will be an inspiration for others , across sectors and domains, and also an inspiration to many young people to follow in your footsteps.</p><p>Let us continue working together to identify new opportunities to create inclusive and sustainable growth for our businesses and peoples. Congratulations to all our finalists I wish everyone a wonderful evening ahead.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp; Defense, Professional Services, Awards and Recognitions, Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["First, carbon markets.

What distinguishes one financial centre from another is the depth of its talent pool and ecosystem, as well as the quality of its regulations.</p><p>At the same time, the financial sector can be volatile - within the last few decades, we went through several financial crises.</p><p>With the financial sector being such a substantial part of the Singapore economy, it is critical that we invest in developing our talent; to ensure that our policies and regulations are responsive and innovative; and build a core team that has the right values, competencies and strategic grasp of issues.</p><p>In today's more volatile and uncertain world, the premium on trust and good leadership has grown.</p><p>While inflation appears to be slowly coming under control, the underpinning geopolitical risks have grown.</p><p>Beyond the US-China strategic competition, we are also contending with unrest and war in different parts of the world - Ukraine, and now Israel and Gaza.</p><p>Countries and companies are rightly seeking to \"de-risk\" and diversify their supply chains and operations.</p><p>In the immediate term, this has benefited safe and trusted nodes like Singapore.</p><p>However, the longer-term worry is that rising protectionism could result in a fragmented and decoupled global economy, which does not bode well for a small and open economy like ours.</p><p>We are also confronting the key challenges of climate change and the technology revolution.</p><p>There are numerous data points that underscore the urgency of the climate challenge - we are seeing rising sea levels and the warmest years on record.</p><p>Yet the world is hardly investing enough to enable the global transition to net-zero by 2050. It is difficult to galvanise leadership attention and mobilise collective action.</p><p>On the technology side, while there is optimism about the new possibilities it can unlock, technology's disruptive nature has also brought anxiety.</p><p>Technology is forcing the pace of economic and industrial transformation. Jobs are being reshaped, and may even disappear. Workers will need to retrain and reskill in order to remain relevant.</p><p>These anxieties can end up being misdirected. It is easier to blame foreigners for taking over jobs, than to confront the difficult task of transformation and reskilling. We have seen this happen in more than a few countries.</p><p>Moreover, with technology being viewed as a source of competitive advantage, some countries have been framing technology through a national security lens to curb collaboration.</p><p>In short, now more than ever, countries and organisations need good leadership and trust to navigate choppier waters.</p><p>At the same time, every challenge is also an opportunity. Can our financial sector help galvanise action to realise the transformations that are needed to overcome these challenges?</p><p>For example, to tackle climate change, we will need to facilitate access to capital, to invest in green and transition projects.</p><p>We want to scale up blended finance, to crowd in more private capital into key projects such as energy transition infrastructure and nature-based solutions in emerging markets.</p><p>It is through such projects that we can facilitate the major transformations across economies, societies and infrastructure.</p><p>On the technology front, we could be seeing fundamental changes to the way the financial system functions.</p><p>In the first digitalisation leap, we harnessed technology to improve access and inclusion for emerging economies, businesses and individuals.</p><p>In the current leap, we are making financial transactions and the banking sector as a whole, even more efficient and seamless, through technologies such as distributed ledgers, Generative AI, and the tokenisation of financial and real economy assets.</p><p>To realise the upside returns from the opportunities, and manage the downside risks, good leadership for the financial sector is critical.</p><p>And the most critical quality of good leadership is trustworthiness. Trust is the currency of finance. We need to maintain trusted systems and organisations, manned by officers of integrity.</p><p>The role of leaders in building, maintaining, and renewing trust cannot be stated enough.</p><p>In navigating a more uncertain world, we also seek leaders who can understand, and decisively respond to new risks, challenges, and opportunities.</p><p>They must then have the skills, savvy, and charisma to lead their organisations and workforces through the necessary transformation, while holding firmly onto core values like trust and integrity.</p><p>And because there are common challenges across the sectors, leaders must be able to drive collaboration across organisations and institutions to reap synergies and strengthen the ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>Across the board, we see that industries and companies that have exceeded expectations are led by leaders who have a keen sense of opportunities, the ability to formulate strategies, and the capacity to build deep capabilities to deliver results.</p><p>This is why we started the AFLP, as a flagship programme to prepare Singaporean leaders for regional and global leadership positions.</p><p>For one, we see that financial sector jobs are becoming more international facing. The estimate is that close to half of these jobs are primarily international in nature.</p><p>This means that the competition for these leadership jobs is global. It is therefore critical that we equip Singaporean talent with the necessary capabilities and skills to succeed.</p><p>This is in line with our consistent commitment to human resource development. With no natural resources to count on, we always do our best to nurture and enable every Singaporean to maximise their potential.</p><p>There are very encouraging signs of this. MAS estimates that the number of Singaporeans taking up senior roles in the financial sector has more than doubled since 2016, in line with the growth of the sector.</p><p>One example is Dennis Tan, the CEO of Prudential Singapore. Dennis graduated from the AFLP in 2017 when he was Head of Consumer Financial Services at OCBC.</p><p>The AFLP enabled Dennis to broaden his horizons and expand his network, which were valuable in advancing his career and leadership journey.</p><p>In fact, after becoming CEO, Dennis was also appointed Managing Director of the Strategic Business Group covering Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. He is part of Prudential's Group Executive Committee at the global level.</p><p>When capable Singaporeans like Dennis win their seat at the table, it serves as inspiration and encouragement to others.</p><p>More importantly, it grows our collective capacity to build a diverse workforce, where we draw in the best talent from all over the world to contribute and grow the sector together.</p><p>I am glad that the AFLP provides a comprehensive experience to enable participants to build the necessary capabilities. Besides offering global perspectives across five countries, it also offers interactions with policymakers, academics, captains of industry, while helping participants sharpen their leadership skills.</p><p>The leadership journey</p><p>Today, we mark the milestone of graduation. But the leadership journey is a marathon, and the AFLP is merely the basic fitness training for you to start right.</p><p>What should you pay attention to as you head back into your workplaces? What else can you do? Let me offer two suggestions:</p><p>First - take charge of your growth, by owning your career and leadership journey.</p><p>Many financial institutions use Singapore as a base for the region, so to take on a leadership role here, it is crucial to build up regional and international experience. In fact, local banks in Singapore have grown their regional and global footprint.</p><p>So, do you do so? First and foremost, be prepared to take on overseas postings.</p><p>Working in a different context with a different set of stakeholders will require us to build up cross-cultural competencies and the muscle to mobilise diverse stakeholders.</p><p>But this requires us to uproot ourselves and even our families from a comfortable and known environment, and venture somewhere new.</p><p>Interestingly, research by the Centre for Creative Leadership showed that taking on HQ stints gives outsized influence and brings advancement opportunities.</p><p>So If you are offered the opportunity to take on an overseas or HQ posting - go for it! It will be good for both your career and personal growth.</p><p>MAS' International Postings Programme is available to help financial institutions defray the costs of such postings. Since 2016, nearly 180 Singaporeans have been supported on such postings.</p><p>The issue of developing leaders for our corporate sector, beyond finance, is one that we are working on.</p><p>Last year, I worked with the Singapore Business Federation to convene an Alliance for Action for business leadership development. The team released its findings and recommendations earlier this year, and emphasised the importance of building leadership muscles through overseas and cross-functional postings.</p><p>By widening our skillsets and broadening our exposure, we grow our competence and confidence in taking on regional and global leadership roles.</p><p>So this is the first point - we must take charge of our own growth and development.</p><p>Second - beyond personal growth, we must grow with others, and help others grow. I therefore encourage you to fully tap on and contribute to the various networks that you are part of.</p><p>First and foremost, there are more than 300 leaders who have come through the AFLP over the years.</p><p>I am glad to hear that there are healthy and sustained interactions, within as well as across cohorts. This alumni network is important to enable you to support one another.</p><p>Singaporean graduates from the AFLP are invited to join the MAS' Singapore Financial Leaders Network (or SFLN) to network and provide peer support to other leaders within the financial sector.</p><p>This initiative began around 10 years ago, during my first term as MAS Board member. Along the way, I have personally engaged with SFLN members and always found them thoughtful.</p><p>The SFLN is a good example of how it is possible to compete in the business, yet at the same time, collaborate and support one another as a community.</p><p>Given the many shared challenges that the financial sector faces, there is plenty of room to collaborate with one another, share good practices, and pursue opportunities at scale.</p><p>Leaders play an important role in building such positive norms and behaviours.</p><p>I am therefore glad that many of the SFLN members have also signed on to EDB's Singapore Leaders Network, which is run by HCLI and enables financial sector leaders to network with peers from outside the financial sector.</p><p>It is useful to be among this community of leaders, so that we can support, grow, and thrive with one another.</p><p>Finally, we must also pay attention to growing and nurturing the next generation of leaders.</p><p>Developing talent is a leadership responsibility; I am certain that in our own career journeys, we would have benefitted from a mentor or a boss who went the extra mile.</p><p>So I hope that you will be generous in paying it forward, by nurturing the young talent in your companies, and encouraging them to step out of comfort zone.</p><p>This way, we can build a sustainable community of leaders.</p><p>In closing, let me once again warmly congratulate all of you for achieving this milestone of graduating from the Asian Financial Leaders Programme.</p><p>The trends and circumstances of our world today means that the knowledge and skills you have picked up during the Programme will be very salient.</p><p>A more uncertain and volatile world calls for good leadership and building trust.</p><p>With our efforts to develop talent for the financial sector over the past decade, we have been able to seize opportunities and deepen the sector, which in turn create more good jobs.</p><p>Let us continue to build on this good work on this virtuous cycle, to strengthen our financial sector, deepen our local bench strength, and offer good leadership that serves not just Singapore, but the region and the world.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Events]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Can our financial sector help galvanise action to realise the transformations that are needed to overcome these challenges?

A very good evening. My heartiest congratulations to our graduates of the Asian Financial Leaders Programme (or AFLP).</p><p>a. There are five cohorts graduating today.

In today's more volatile and uncertain world, the premium on trust and good leadership has grown.</p><p>a. While inflation appears to be slowly coming under control, the underpinning geopolitical risks have grown.</p><p>i. Beyond the US-China strategic competition, we are also contending with unrest and war in different parts of the world - Ukraine, and now Israel and Gaza.</p><p>ii. Countries and companies are rightly seeking to \"de-risk\" and diversify their supply chains and operations.</p><p>iii. In the immediate term, this has benefited safe and trusted nodes like Singapore.</p><p>iv. However, the longer-term worry is that rising protectionism could result in a fragmented and decoupled global economy, which does not bode well for a small and open economy like ours.</p><p>b.

Developing talent is a leadership responsibility; I am certain that in our own career journeys, we would have benefitted from a mentor or a boss who went the extra mile.</p><p>ii. So I hope that you will be generous in paying in forward, by nurturing the young talent in your companies, and encouraging them to step out of comfort zone.</p><p>iii. This way, we can build a sustainable community of leaders.</p><p>10. In closing, let me once again warmly congratulate all of you for achieving this milestone of graduating from the Asian Financial Leaders Programme.</p><p>a. The trends and circumstances of our world today means that the knowledge and skills you have picked up during the Programme will be very salient.</p><p>b. A more uncertain and volatile world calls for good leadership and building trust.</p><p>c. With our efforts to develop talent for the financial sector over the past decade, we have been able to seize opportunities and deepen the sector, which in turn create more good jobs.</p><p>d. Let us continue to build on this good work to strengthen our financial sector, deepen our local bench strength, and offer good leadership that serves not just Singapore, but the region and the world.</p><p>e.

Sinking land, or land subsidence, can aggravate the problem, a team of international scientists led by the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) found.</p><p> Ms Cheryl Tay, a PhD student at NTU's Asian School of the Environment (ASE) and the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), noted that the many coastal cities in Asia are now centres of growth and rapid urbanisation.

It has identified three potential sustainability-related research projects - one on biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services; a second on human capital; and a third on human rights. A fourth potential project will explore integration in reporting. The ISSB has already launched its first two standards (the first covering general requirements and the second covering climate), which are expected to be finalised in June 2023. While the ISSB has adopted a \"climate-first\" approach, it is important to note that it is predominantly focused on the impacts of climate-related issues within an organisation.We are also cognisant of the launch of the new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TFND) framework in September, and how that might compare with the existing Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and impact the implementation of ISSB.With the ISSB planning to develop additional standards in the future and as nature-based solutions as part of the next priorities, we will soon understand the alignment the ISSB has with TFND. </p><p>Jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific and South-east Asia have started to mandate disclosures in alignment with the TCFD recommendations in recent years. We expect that some regulators will continue to strengthen their regulatory requirements and mandate the ISSB standards in the foreseeable future.Over time, we anticipate that South-east Asia will continue to align mandatory climate disclosure requirements with major global markets, including the United Kingdom and the European Union, and that the ISSB standards will become a regulatory requirement. This will also help build further trust and credibility of the disclosure framework.A complex landscapeBusinesses are committing to measuring and reporting their climate and sustainability performances now more than ever. The pressure to provide more clarity on these measurements by increasing the scope of reporting comes from all stakeholders - customers, investors, and even employees.However, making the commitment towards providing more clarity has been difficult, given the disparate and complex global landscape of climate and sustainability reporting. To mitigate this challenge, IFRS launched the ISSB as an international body tasked with developing a consistent global baseline for sustainability-related financial disclosures.The ISSB was launched at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. Since its inception, the ISSB has been hard at work to create a universal reporting standard, with first exposure drafts of the standards released in April 2022. The proposed standards leverage the existing TCFD framework's four pillars of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.These draft standards require organisations to disclose the effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on their financial position, financial performance, and cash flows, along with how they expect their financial position and performance to change over time given their decarbonisation strategy.Historically, requirements have been complex and difficult to communicate across industries and sectors. The ISSB is designed to give stakeholders - particularly investors - clear, consistent, and comparable information about a company's sustainability and climate-related risks and opportunities. The ISSB has also proposed that this information be disclosed as a part of general-purpose financial reporting.South-east Asia steps upAs we have noted above, we anticipate that regulators in South-east Asia will strengthen their climate disclosure mandates over the next few years, and will likely include the ISSB standards as part of their mandatory ESG disclosure requirements for listed companies.Currently, several regulatory bodies have already expressed interest and support for the ISSB, although there are no current plans to mandate disclosures in alignment with the ISSB standards in the region.Existing frameworks may also influence South-east Asian businesses and country regulations, as more jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific and South-east Asia are mandating disclosures in alignment with TCFD recommendations.The TCFD is now mandatory for certain industries in several Asia-Pacific jurisdictions, including Singapore. Some businesses also practise voluntary sustainability reporting using the TCFD, while the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards are increasingly commonplace amongst larger listed entities. Larger companies are therefore better positioned to adopt the proposed ISSB standards.However, many - particularly smaller listed entities - are less well placed. Education, tools, and clear guidance will be required to upskill professionals in the region on the implementation of ISSB standards, and how that may affect their reporting procedures.Challenges in implementationSouth-east Asian countries and businesses based in the region will need to make some adjustments and modifications to any regulations, to ensure enforceability and ease of implementation. There are increasing expectations for climate-related issues to be reflected in financial statements, which organisations must adapt to.Data integrity, transparency and verification are also major challenges, not least when considering value chain and Scope 3 reporting. It will be challenging for companies to report comprehensive and high-quality data in alignment with the ISSB standards if organisations do not invest in and implement the right monitoring and reporting systems, along with new models and methods for data sharing.We also anticipate that businesses in the region may face issues with the preparation of ESG disclosures assurance. We predict that, over time, assurance over sustainability-related disclosures will become mandatory, starting with limited assurance, and eventually moving into reasonable assurance.Regulators across the region are closely watching the ISSB developments, and several have welcomed the new standards and their efforts to consolidate the climate reporting landscape to investors.Becoming ISSB-readyTaking tangible steps towards climate action should be a priority for all organisations. Besides working towards decarbonisation, there are some additional steps organisations can take for climate-led transformation.First, to commit to a climate change and sustainability target; second, to develop a climate change and sustainability strategy and to align this with their organisational goals. Organisations could also enhance organisational capabilities to deal with sustainability targets and finally, regularly monitor and report on the progress of these goals.Tackling climate change and sustainability issues will deliver significant benefits to an organisation, but it cannot be realised without re-allocation of capital and new investment. To become ISSB-ready, organisations need to focus on new priorities, starting with diagnosing and assessing the gaps and impact the draft ISSB standards will have on their existing processes. From there, they should put in place strategic plans and road maps to operationalise measurement and review. Finally, organisations need to communicate the implications of these standards to stakeholders, including the C-suite and board.By staying ahead of the regulatory curve and aligning with global best practices, organisations can become climate-resilient and invest in the economic opportunity of the global transition to the low-carbon economy - all while becoming ISSB-ready.Brian Ho is the sustainability and climate assurance leader at Deloitte Asia Pacific.
