Now that responsibility is more vital than ever. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The forces shaping today's investment environment go beyond any market cycle or structural trend. They strike at the foundations of the global order. They are rewriting the rules of global investing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Our response relies on two pillars: top-down portfolio construction and bottom-up asset selection. We diversify with intent, deploy with granularity, act with agility, and invest in partnerships, always taking the long view, protecting against permanent impairment, and preparing rather than predicting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> PerformanceFor the 20-year period from Apr 1, 2005, to Mar 31, 2025, the annualised US dollar nominal return of our portfolio was 5.7 per cent.  Adjusting for global inflation, the annualised 20-year real return was 3.8 per cent.  Our long-term returns remained stable, though in recent years a confluence of factors have affected this performance, which we detail in the Investment Report.</p><p> A world in fluxCyclical shifts in growth, inflation and interest rates continue to influence markets. However, these cycles now produce a wider cone of outcomes and interact with deeper, longer-term forces playing out over years rather than quarters.</p><p> We group these forces into two categories: structural and foundational. Structural shifts evolve within the existing system; they can often be analysed and prepared for. Foundational shifts, by contrast, fundamentally transform the system itself, challenging long-held assumptions and requiring a basic rethinking of portfolio construction and investment management.</p><p> Structural shifts include rising public debt, demographic changes, growing global imbalances between savings and spending, and widening gaps in technology adoption. These are already altering capital flows across borders, weighing on productivity in some regions and influencing long-term returns. </p><p> Foundational shifts go even deeper, redefining the post-war world order once based on free trade, capital mobility, and institutional trust. Long-standing assumptions about safe havens, liquidity and asset correlation are being challenged. Politics and geopolitics now influence economies and financial markets directly and immediately. </p><p> In an increasingly more volatile and fragmented trade system, policy decisions can quickly reverse advantages. Similar fragmentation is unfolding in capital markets. Financial systems are dividing along geopolitical fault lines, complicating cross-border investing. </p><p> Finally, artificial intelligence (AI) and the climate transition are also unfolding in ways that signal not only long-term transformation, but also foundational change, reshaping how economies function, how capital is deployed and how future value will be created. </p><p> Investment approachFaced with these profound changes, it is tempting to chase the short-term hype or retreat in the face of the unknown. At GIC, we do neither. We focus on long-term value, with an emphasis on avoiding permanent loss. We apply \"inversion\" -- studying the typical causes of permanent impairment in order to steer clear of them. Historically, such losses have stemmed from poor fundamentals, disposals due to an inability to service debts, exogenous shocks or even fraud. Our investment process is designed to guard against such pitfalls. </p><p> Less obvious but equally damaging is overpaying. Situations such as the Nikkei bubble in the late 1980s, the Nasdaq collapse in the early 2000s, and the periodic bursting of meme stock bubbles all illustrate the dangers of valuation overshoot. Even if asset prices eventually recover, the time lost will have been too great. This is why we remain disciplined on price. </p><p> From the top down, we focus on harvesting long-term risk premia in a diversified manner -- building a resilient and flexible portfolio that can withstand market stresses, adapt across cycles and long-term shifts and compound value over time. While concentrated markets can make diversification feel costly in the short term, it remains essential to long-term portfolio resilience. GIC diversifies across asset classes, geographies, sectors and time. For example, in private markets, we spread investments across multiple years -- known as time or vintage year diversification -- to avoid overexposure to any single time period. </p><p> Amid unprecedented shifts, we also need granularity and agility. Within broad themes such as AI or climate, opportunities vary widely across value chains. We need to break these down into investible segments. For instance, in AI, we distinguish between enablers such as chipmakers or data centre providers, monetisers like cloud platforms and software companies, and adopters integrating AI into their operations. This enables our investments to be more targeted. </p><p> Similarly, in climate, we recognise long-term opportunities in electrification, energy efficiency and climate adaptation. However, investments vary in risk profile, policy support and relevance across markets. In the global energy landscape, exponential demand growth and persistent supply disruptions have renewed focus on energy security and affordability. This has resulted in more fragmented investment trends, with each country charting its own path to secure, cost-competitive energy sources.</p><p> Agility requires us to act decisively as these trends evolve. In volatile markets, dislocations arise when market participants are forced to buy or sell, creating mispriced assets. By preserving liquidity and flexibility, we can respond when others can't -- whether in private credit during bank lending crunches or secondaries where liquidity-seeking investors sell at discounts. We also see agility as the ability to spot underappreciated themes early. Climate adaptation, a vital but historically overlooked part of the climate response, is gaining urgency as physical risks rise. It is becoming both an inevitable need and a complementary investment theme alongside decarbonisation. GIC research estimates that the investment value for a select set of adaptation solutions will grow from US$2 trillion today to US$9 trillion by 2050, with US$3 trillion attributed to incremental growth driven by global warming. This opens up opportunities across both established solutions, including weather-resilient building materials and emerging technologies such as weather intelligence.</p><p> PartnershipsAt GIC, we believe that navigating uncertainty requires deep, robust collaboration. We invest in relationships as we do in assets -- for the long term. Our global presence across more than 40 markets reinforces this commitment, providing on-the-ground insights and the continuity needed to build trusted, lasting partnerships. </p><p> AI capabilitiesOne area demanding concerted effort and commitment across the organisation is technology integration. Like many, GIC is actively building its AI capabilities. In internal audit, for instance, we leverage AI to detect anomalies in both structured and unstructured data, automating the analysis of large and diverse data sets to identify risk trends and focus areas. </p><p> We are also integrating AI more deeply into our investment process. Drawing from more than 40 years of investment data, we are developing prototypes such as a virtual investment committee member, which taps into GIC's institutional knowledge to generate probing questions, challenge assumptions, and surface contrarian insights in real time.</p><p> Looking aheadThe year 2025 may be a turning point in markets -- and in history. As the investment world grows more complex, our responsibility to steward Singapore's reserves -- with integrity and foresight -- remains our guiding purpose.</p><p> The writer is chief executive officer of GIC.

Good afternoon to all of you. It is my pleasure to join you today at this SEAPAW Ecosperity event.</p><p>Impact of climate change on Southeast Asia</p><p>2. It is fitting that this event is called \"Water at the Core: Accelerating Climate Adaptation in Southeast Asia\", as climate change impacts are becoming more apparent worldwide in the form of more extreme weather events, such as droughts and storms. Although the world has made some progress in climate mitigation since the Paris Agreement, efforts remain insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. If global temperature rise overshoots this and reaches 2 degree Celsius, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that 50% more of the world's population would live under water stress.</p><p>3. Water stress arises from the extremes of too little and too much water. Too little water, and many of Southeast Asia's economic activities, such as agriculture and tourism which depend on water, will be severely affected. Too much water, and this could lead to sea level rise and flooding, threatening our people given our geography comprising long coastlines, low-lying islands, and dense urban centres.</p><p>Singapore Water Story</p><p>4. These are among the starkest environmental challenges facing Singapore. As a small island city-state with limited natural catchment, Singapore is amongst the most water stressed in the world. Our Water Story demonstrated that acknowledging our vulnerabilities can spur us to overcome them by leveraging technologies to diversify our water sources. Singapore began studying the feasibility of reclaimed water since the 1970s, and today NEWater has become one of our weather-resilient sources in Singapore's \"Four National Taps\" strategy.</p><p>5. At the same time, being situated in the tropics also results in the problem of too much water within a short span of time. In the 1960s and 1970s, Singapore faced frequent and widespread flooding during the monsoon season. While Singapore has invested in expanding our drainage infrastructure, it is not feasible to expand our drains to cater for every extreme rainfall event. We are thus enhancing community resilience by supporting our community to better prepare for and respond to flood incidents, such as by issuing early warnings of potential flood. The next chapter of flood resilience will be coastal protection to deal with rising sea levels. Many of you would have heard about initiatives such as our Long Island, which will not only protect our low-lying east coast from sea level rise, but also create new land for future opportunities.</p><p>Investing in Climate Resilience</p><p>6. Our experience has shown us that it is important to understand our risks clearly, start early and invest conscientiously to strengthen our climate resilience. However, there is serious underinvestment worldwide. According to a report by the Climate Policy Initiative, global investments in climate adaptation and resilience initiatives made up only 5% of total annual climate finance and 20-30% of projected annual climate adaptation financing needs. I would like to touch on two areas where there are opportunities to do better.</p><p>7. First, the private sector. We need to increase the private sector's awareness of physical climate risks and the cost-of-inaction. Understanding climate risks is key to business strategy and future-proofing your business. When it comes to addressing climate risks, prevention is better than cure. A small investment in climate resilience today can help to address broader risks, and mitigate potentially larger future losses. There are many ways to help companies tackle climate risks. First, we need better climate projections, such as the findings from Singapore's 3rd National Climate Change Study (V3), which we completed last year. V3 provides the highest resolution of climate projections over Southeast Asia for parameters such as rainfall and temperature. Through our recently launched V3 Data Sharing Portal, companies can tap on V3 climate projections to understand the climate risks in their supply chains under future conditions. Next, climate disclosure frameworks can encourage companies to pay closer attention to their climate risks across geographies and supply chains. Beginning Financial Year (FY) 2025, there will be a move towards mandatory climate-related disclosures for listed companies and large non-listed companies in Singapore. These disclosures will be aligned with the framework developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This will raise companies' awareness and spur them to take a more informed view of addressing climate risks. I encourage companies to leverage climate projections such as V3 for your climate risk assessment, and to undertake climate disclosure seriously.</p><p>8. With climate disclosure, the risks become more apparent, and companies would seek to reduce their climate exposure. One way would be to relocate their operations to another place with less climate risk. A more beneficial approach would be for companies to invest in where they operate, increasing the community's climate resilience while also strengthening their supply chain resilience. For example, Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) is Singaporean wafer fabrication company who has been recycling water at an average of 67%, above the industry average of 45%. This improves onsite water efficiency and decreases water consumption, leading to a more water-resilient supply chain, especially during the dry months of the year. I would like to challenge companies to explore how you can do likewise for your operations throughout Southeast Asia.</p><p>9. The second area we can focus on is to enhance adaptation finance. We can do so by making climate adaptation projects more bankable through blended finance, and also by building capability in climate finance.</p><p>10. Collectively, we should explore how to support blended finance in climate adaptation, so that we can create more bankable projects that crowd in private capital to plug the gap in adaptation financing. This is important as only about 2% of adaptation finance comes from private and philanthropic sectors. Blended finance can make adaptation projects more bankable through a combination of concessional capital, technical assistance and de-risking mechanisms. Concessional capital could comprise grants or guarantees, with technical assistance covering areas such as project development to strengthen investor confidence and project bankability. We need to reduce the project risks sufficiently to attract private commercial capital.</p><p>11. Putting these altogether, we should also recognise the critical role that local partners and NGOs like SEAPAW play. SEAPAW builds on the Singapore International Foundation (SIF)'s track record over the past 34 years, whose projects have created community benefits in more than 28 countries. Through SEAPAW's network of partners, it can localise global solutions and partner them with the right financing options which are suited to the needs of communities. One example is SEAPAW's project in Sarawak, Malaysia, which aims to bring clean water to rural communities. The project uses advancements in membrane technology in the water purification process to enhance water resilience and address the issue of clean water supply. At the same time, it is powered sustainably by a renewable energy source. Once the pilot is successful and partnered with the right financing, it can be scaled up to benefit many more communities within Southeast Asia. This multi-stakeholder approach taken by SEAPAW allows them to harness the strengths from across the public, private and philanthropic sectors, and bring them to bear in addressing the climate challenges we face in our region.</p><p>Closing</p><p>12. In closing, similar to how Singapore made early investments in NEWater, which is now a key pillar for our water resilience, we need to invest now for the future for our climate resilience. We need to act decisively today for the long-term, by increasing the knowledge on risks and encouraging climate adaptation finance. I encourage organisations and individuals across sectors to explore how you can contribute to this collective effort. Whether through funding, innovation, or community support, do join SEAPAW in accelerating Southeast Asia's climate resilience.</p><p>[Category: Water Utilities, Utilities, Partnerships and Alliances, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["* Singapore is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, with limited natural catchment, and has invested in technologies to diversify its water sources, such as reclaimed water. * The private sector can play a crucial role in addressing climate risks, and companies can leverage climate projections and climate disclosure frameworks to understand and mitigate their climate exposure. 1.

It's about understanding how deeply interconnected these risks are when you're running operations across multiple markets. </p><p> The numbers tell an interesting story: 61 per cent of global organisations admit they're unprepared for cyber threats, but in Singapore, businesses have developed what we see as an \"all-front defence strategy\", with remarkably consistent investment across all cybersecurity dimensions.</p><p> This balanced approach jumps out from the data.

Singapore executives rate climate change concerns at 42 per cent -- significantly higher than in Hong Kong (16 per cent) and Japan (20 per cent). This isn't just about being environmentally conscious -- it reflects the hard reality that multi-market operations face climate risks that ripple across diverse geographies, regulatory environments, and supply chains. </p><p> One Singapore CEO put it rather bluntly: \"When a climate event hits one of our markets, the headache spreads through our entire regional operation in ways that single-market businesses just don't experience.\"</p><p> The same goes for navigating regulations: 71 per cent of global organisations confess they're not ready for international regulatory changes, but in Singapore, C-suite leaders have had to develop more balanced approaches to juggling technology resilience, data privacy, cybersecurity, ESG (environmental, social and governance) and AI regulations across multiple jurisdictions -- all at the same time.</p><p> This complexity conundrum demands a different sort of leadership. Singapore executives simply can't afford to become experts in one risk area while neglecting others.

Water supply tends to be regulated utilities that operate in natural monopolies, which have defensive characteristics and stable cash flows.</p><p> Environmental services are generally engineering companies. This includes companies that design water and wastewater treatment plants, but also engineering and consulting companies that help industrial users of water map and reduce their water use.</p><p> In the water strategy portfolio are around 48 companies, the bulk of which are predominantly in North America. Positions, on average, are held for seven years, added Lecamp.</p><p> \"We think the best way to offer investors returns in the water universe is to stay with high-quality companies that have high return on invested capital,\" he elaborated, noting that these companies tend to be more in the US than the rest of the world.</p><p> As for returns generated for share investors in Pictet AM's water strategy, this is about 8.6 per cent per annum in euro terms, mainly driven by share prices appreciation of the listed equities, said Lecamp.  </p><p> Water reuse is one of four front of mind issues for Lecamp. He sees much untapped potential to address water availability challenges to meet growing needs for municipal drinking water and from industry. </p><p> He noted that by 2050, around 50 per cent of global water extraction could be reused, versus around 12 per cent today, as prospects for growth water reuse are being buoyed by technological disruptions and innovations.  </p><p> Lecamp's other front-of-mind issues are the growing penetration of professional waste management services, closing the water infrastructure spending deficit and the increase in private sector participation to achieve universal coverage of water and wastewater.</p><p> For one, public spending on water that averages 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product is insufficient to stop the ageing of water infrastructure, argues Lecamp. </p><p> Environmental opportunitiesMeanwhile, on the environment solutions front, Pictet AM is eyeing opportunities presented by what it estimates is a US$5 trillion market, which is growing at around seven to 8 per cent per annum.</p><p> Pictet AM's global environment opportunities strategy has around US$8 billion of AUM and is invested in around 40 to 45 companies, said senior investment manager Luciano Diana. </p><p> By geography, over 60 per cent of portfolio companies are in the US, while about 25 per cent are in Europe, said Diana. He added that some non-Asian portfolio companies have substantial Asian exposure in their business.   </p><p> For Pictet AM's environmental strategy, the focus is on investing in relatively mature technology and in companies that generate strong free cash flow, he said. The average holding period of investments is about 3.5 years. </p><p> Pictet AM breaks down environmental solutions into seven segments -- renewable energy, energy efficiency, dematerialised economy, sustainable agriculture and forestry, water supply and technology, waste management and recycling, and pollution control.</p><p> Currently, the largest segment of Pictet AM's portfolio in the environmental theme is in energy efficiency, which covers industrial efficiency, building efficiency and transportation electrification. </p><p> Diana said the exposure to renewable energy has been very low because \"there are a lot of companies that might grow revenues, but they operate in an industry that is very commoditised\".</p><p> Looking ahead, a growth driver that excites Diana is being in the early innings of a US investment wave which accelerates demand for power.  </p><p> He sees power demand growth in the US being spurred by demand for big data, increasing electrification and resurgence in industrial manufacturing. He noted US electricity generation could see a compound annual growth rate over the 2024-2030 period, which is six times that of the prior years this century.</p><p> The other big growth driver is growing demand for climate adaptation solutions, which is in turn being fuelled by extreme weather events, said Diana. </p><p> He sees a continued push for mitigation solutions to slow or prevent climate change, with an example being renewable energy, as well as for adaptation solutions to limit the damage that environmental changes cause such as flood defences.</p><p> Currently, Pictet AM's thematic equities platform has around US$70 billion in AUM across 16 strategies.

Good morning. I am pleased to join you once again for the Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources. I thank Simon and SIIA team for having me at this annual event again. This year's edition comes at a time of pivotal global geopolitical developments.</p><p>Climate change continues despite global headwinds</p><p>2. The rules based multilateral system is under pressure. Protectionism is rising, and trade barriers and supply chain disruptions are becoming more frequent. Governments and businesses are reassessing their priorities and strategies, including their environmental and climate ambitions.</p><p>3. We have also seen countries taking their foot off in climate action. Political support for decarbonisation is losing momentum and climate finance is becoming more elusive. Yet, we find ourselves confronted with an undeniable fact: climate change is here, and now. Its impact on lives is drastic and rising.</p><p>4. Many Southeast Asian countries have experienced extreme weather events recently:</p><p>* In the second half of 2024, intense floods swept across Malaysia and Thailand, displacing thousands of people and damaging infrastructure worth millions of dollars;</p><p>*Sweltering heatwaves are increasingly frequent across the ASEAN region. The Philippines experienced a severe heatwave throughout March and April this year, and Myanmar recording its highest ever April temperatures of 48.2C last year.</p><p>Importance of regional cooperation</p><p>5. As climate change intensifies amidst these uncertain times, the need for greater ASEAN cooperation to address the challenges faced by our region is more salient than ever.</p><p>6. ASEAN is making progress in climate action.</p><p>*Of the 10 ASEAN countries, eight have committed to an economy-wide net-zero target or carbon neutrality.</p><p>*The ASEAN Centre for Climate Change will be set up in Brunei Darulssalam to facilitate regional cooperation and coordination on climate change initiatives. All 10 ASEAN member states have signed the Establishment Agreement and the Centre will be officially stood up once the Agreement is ratified by member states.</p><p>*ASEAN is investing in renewable energy sources as the region's energy demand is expected to more than double by 2040. As a region, we are working towards integrating the power systems to form an ASEAN Power Grid, which will enhance regional energy security while decarbonising the power sector.</p><p>7. Many of us here today are from the agribusiness industry. Agribusiness and sustainable forestry practices have a pivotal role in ASEAN countries' climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.</p><p>Sustainable agribusiness and forestry practices</p><p>8. ASEAN countries are among the world's largest producers of agricultural commodities, contributing to about 80% of global palm oil, 80% of global rubber, and 20% of global rice production. The agriculture, forestry and fishing industries collectively contribute to about 10% of ASEAN's GDP, and remains a primary source of jobs for many people across the region.</p><p>9. Agriculture production is both a cause and a victim of climate change. According to a UN study, the various steps of farming, transportation, consumption and disposal emit a third of all human-caused greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, changing weather patterns such as intense heat and droughts decrease yield and productivity.</p><p>10. Hence, sustainable agribusiness and forestry practices are instrumental in climate action and resource conservation. By avoiding unsustainable farming practices, such as burning stubbles and slash-and-burn techniques, we could reduce the risk of deforestation and transboundary haze. Notably, Thailand, Lao PDR and Myanmar have made such efforts through the joint Clear Sky Strategy 2024-2030 launched last October.</p><p>11. Similarly, Indonesia's efforts to reduce deforestation through legislations and continued monitoring, as well as Malaysia's sustainable palm oil initiatives such as the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil Certification Scheme, show how we can balance economic needs with environmental protection.</p><p>12. Sustainable agribusiness and forestry practices is therefore an imperative, not an option. Besides positive impact on the environment, there are business advantages.</p><p>*Growing consumer awareness about environmental concerns has increased demand for certified-sustainable products. Certification marks such as the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) are helping the public to identify over 4300 products that meet eco-standards. In Singapore, the public sector has embarked on green procurement. Since 2016, the Singapore Government only buys paper that carry the Singapore Green Label, which gives assurance that suppliers practice sustainable forestry management.</p><p>*Commitment to sustainability also strengthens supply chain resilience and risk management. Sourcing from suppliers that practice sustainable agriculture reduces the risk of supply disruptions caused by environmental events or regulatory changes. It also helps companies mitigate reputational risk by ensuring that operations are environmentally responsible.</p><p>*There are also regulatory developments imposed by export markets. For example, the EU has announced its plans to introduce regulations on Deforestation-free Products (also known as EUDR). Companies that want to continue exports to the EU must therefore take compliance into consideration to maintain market access.</p><p>13. Singapore remains committed to supporting sustainable agribusinesses despite not having a significant traditional agriculture industry. We are a finance hub for many agribusinesses and commodity trades in the region, and we are growing our local agri-tech sector. We are also a very active centre in carbon services with many new carbon services company setting up headquarters and operations in Singapore.</p><p>14. We are collaborating closely with regional partners to develop climate-resilient crops and sustainable farming practices. Our researchers at the National University of Singapore's Tropical Marine Science Institute are working closely with ASEAN countries to study the impact of climate change on ASEAN's agriculture sector to enhance regional food security. The study is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2026. The study will help ASEAN better manage the risks, so that we can plan our response to adapt to the impacts of climate change on crop production at national and local levels.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>15.In conclusion, I would like to summarise three key points:</p><p>* First, climate change waits for no one. We need to maintain the momentum of climate action in spite of the global headwinds, and keep a steady course in achieving the green transition.</p><p>*Second, it is imperative for ASEAN to deepen our cooperation in climate action. Fortunately, we are not starting from ground zero, and ASEAN countries must build on the work that has been done and continue the spirit of cooperation to take ASEAN forward.</p><p>*Third, sustainable agribusiness and forestry practices is good for business and the environment. We must ensure that our efforts to develop the agri-commodity sector align with our environmental commitments.</p><p>16. I hope that the 12th Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources catalyses thinking on the future of the agribusiness and forestry industry, and how they contribute to sustainability in ASEAN. I would like to thank SIIA once again for their efforts today.</p><p>17. I wish you fruitful discussions ahead.

Revenue would come from the sale of carbon credits to companies or governments, with each credit representing a tonne of emissions avoided by shutting a power plant early. </p><p> On May 7, it was announced that Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corporation had joined Singapore's Keppel and investment platform GenZero in a climate initiative that aims to retire a Philippine coal plant early using funds from a transition credit scheme backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. </p><p> The aim is to retire the plant by 2030 -- ahead of its scheduled closure in 2040 -- and replace it with renewable energy and battery storage.</p><p> The initiative, if successful, could be a model used to shut down dozens of other coal plants early around the globe, especially in Asia.</p><p> A report released on May 7 by global management consultancy BCG and Temasek showed that expenditure on climate adaptation and resilience is projected to rise to between US$500 billion (S$648 billion) and US$1.3 trillion a year by 2030.</p><p> This presents an opportunity for investors to put their money into growth sectors for climate adaptation solutions, such as hazard warning systems, climate-resilient crops and flood defences.</p><p> The importance of collaborations and partnerships -- between countries and sectors -- in tackling climate change was also repeatedly emphasised during the week. </p><p> This is notable given the inward-leaning policies being promoted in other parts of the world. </p><p> A planetary crisis like climate change cannot be tackled by one country alone, and collaborations can help to broaden the market for sustainable investments.</p><p> At Ecosperity Week and partner events like the GenZero Climate Summit and the Climate Group Asia Action Summit, at least three areas of collaboration were discussed: carbon markets, the Asean power grid and blended finance. </p><p> Carbon markets allow countries to collaborate on climate action, as they allow funds to flow from large emitters, usually developed countries, to countries where carbon projects are usually hosted, usually developing countries.</p><p> This can spark a whole industry -- carbon services -- offering a wide range of opportunities, from carbon project development to monitoring and verification services, and legal and regulatory consultancies. </p><p>Singapore had identified carbon services as an engine of growth for its green economy in the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the nation's sustainability blueprint launched in February 2021.</p><p> Regarding the Asean grid, Singapore has sent a strong policy signal with a goal that by 2035, some 30 per cent of its energy supply is expected to come from clean energy imports. </p><p> This commitment provides investors with some degree of revenue certainty. </p><p> But some investments, such as in subsea cables, can be costly and risky, which highlights the need for another form of collaboration between sectors.</p><p> This is where blended finance comes into play, leveraging public and philanthropic funding support to entice private funding to come on board.</p><p>Singapore's Ambassador for Climate Action Ravi Menon summed it up well when he spoke about the importance of \"how to make money work harder, more effectively\". </p><p> Public funding is willing but insufficient, while private funding is ample but unwilling to commit owing to high risks or because returns are not commensurate with the risks, the former chief of Singapore's central bank said during a panel discussion at the Philanthropy Asia Summit, an Ecosperity partner event.</p><p> Collaboration among the public, private and philanthropic sectors on financing can significantly scale the amount of money available for sustainable investments.</p><p> The 11th edition of the annual sustainability conference comes amid significant global headwinds to climate action -- a far cry from some years earlier, when countries were racing to help their economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic in an environmentally sustainable way. </p><p> Economic uncertainties and trade concerns are undoubtedly top of mind in the current geopolitical context. But climate change impacts will not spare us just because we are not paying attention. </p><p> As SM Teo said: \"We must be clear-minded... Long-term success requires both a firm grasp of the demands of today and a steady eye on the needs of tomorrow.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The aim is to retire the plant by 2030 -- ahead of its scheduled closure in 2040 -- and replace it with renewable energy and battery storage.

Given that many major wildfires in the United States and Australia are sparked by vegetation encroaching onto power lines, most utility companies are managing this problem by having workers manually cut down trees getting too close to the power lines. </p><p> With satellite drone imagery, utility companies are able to manage such risks in a much more efficient way. </p><p> Yet, Drew pointed out that there is still currently a low level of awareness and understanding among financial institutions on what constitutes adaptation finance.</p><p> In the midst of developing the guide, she was often asked by banks and asset managers: \"What do you mean by (adaptation finance)? Do you mean \"loss and damage\"? Isn't that the job of the government'\"</p><p> \"Loss and damage\" refers to a fund, established by countries at the United Nations climate change conference, that will be financed by developed countries to compensate developing countries experiencing the worst impacts of climate change. </p><p> There is therefore a need for the industry to have a common definition of adaptation finance and the commercial opportunities arising from it, as well as an understanding of the financing mechanisms and the type of projects available, said Drew.</p><p> \"Inaction is not a world that you can conceive. It's loss of economic prosperity, it's loss of livelihoods, it's people's health, it's life, et cetera... We can either invest in it now and do it in a nice, orderly way. Or we can wait till it's disaster, and then it's chaos,\" she added.</p><p> The importance of taking adaptation and resiliency actions early is also highlighted by Lubomir Varbanov, Swiss Re's managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific.</p><p> Physical impacts from a climate event can be mitigated if climate resiliency is built into urban planning sufficiently early, he said at the same panel. </p><p> It is a misconception that disaster risk insurance only has a role to play in the aftermath of a climate disaster as a shock absorber, Varbanov noted.</p><p> He cited an example of Swiss Re partnering with local governments in Australia to financially quantify their natural hazard risks. This allows them to pre-emptively identify their highest risk assets across all types of natural disasters and their locations, so as to factor this information into their planning processes.   </p><p> If more action to increase climate resiliency is not taken, the rising costs of insurance will lead to affordability issues, especially for vulnerable communities.</p><p> Varbanov noted that four of the last five years have seen over US$100 billion of insured losses from natural disasters. </p><p> He said that there needs to be more public and private partnerships, where data is shared and common objectives are set. </p><p> An enabling environment, with regulations that promote an open market and optimal price setting that does not make the insurance industry more expensive, are also important. </p><p> Helping livelihoodsOn the issue of policy reforms, Drew noted that local governments often cite how policy suggestions, such as the redirection of subsidies, are politically challenging to implement. </p><p> However, she added that it is important for the private sector and development finance institutions to highlight to policymakers how these policy reforms \"are going to actually create an enormous amount of opportunity for the livelihoods of (their) people\".</p><p> \"So politically, (they're) helping (their) people.

It has also been painted by some as a \"liberal\" or \"woke\" cause, never mind that climate change and forest fires have devastated communities. Seeing this, many people avoid the topic of climate change, even at the dinner table. </p><p> \"This overwhelming majority in favour of climate action is not reflected in most news coverage.

It's not reflected in what most political leaders talk about and say,\" said Mr Mark Hertsgaard, a US journalist and co-founder and executive director of Covering Climate Now (CCN), a global initiative that works with media organisations to boost climate coverage and education. </p><p> \"It is a reflection of the incredible effectiveness of this 40-plus-year campaign of lies and deception that the fossil fuel industry has mounted internationally,\" said Mr Hertsgaard. </p><p> Internal records show that scientists at some of the biggest oil and gas firms, including Exxon-Mobil, knew decades ago that burning fossil fuels will cause global warming. But Big Oil decided to cover up the overwhelming weight of science that humans are causing climate change. They have funded pro-fossil fuel lobbyists and politicians to push back against stronger climate action.</p><p> Challenging the industry's narratives is a focus of CCN's 89 Percent Project, an initiative launched in April 2025 that seeks to unravel the reasons for the silent majority and solutions to unite them. Dozens of media outlets around the globe are part of the initiative. </p><p> The fact that there is a large unheard majority fundamentally shifts the framing of how all of us think about climate change and the politics of climate change, Mr Hertsgaard told The Straits Times. </p><p> \"You know, we've believed that it's this hopelessly polarised issue that is too controversial to talk about. And that's just wrong,\" he said. </p><p> Human nature also feeds the perception gap, said Dr Olivia Jensen, a social scientist and deputy director of the Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore. </p><p> \"When individuals answer the question about what other people think, they bring to mind observed behaviour rather than imagining what people's underlying values might be, so they guess that other people do not care much about climate change,\" she told ST.</p><p> It's human nature to avoid confrontation or awkward social moments. As someone who has been writing about climate change for many years, it can be frustrating to observe colleagues, friends and even family holding on to false beliefs about climate change. </p><p> And there's another reason. Climate change tends to be portrayed as an endless string of disasters, a story of hopelessness. That leads to news fatigue, especially with the daily news cycle dominated by stories of wars, tariffs and other geopolitical risks.</p><p> Media organisations need to do a better job telling the story of climate solutions and financial opportunities and promoting public discussion and education. </p><p> The media plays an important role in driving stronger climate action, Singapore's Ambassador for Climate Action Ravi Menon told ST: \"The media can help by constantly reminding everyone that climate change remains the biggest challenge and risk facing people and that climate action is just as urgent and important as other priorities.\"</p><p> What do the surveys say'To really accelerate change, the majority need to be heard. </p><p> Four in every five people (80 per cent) called for their country to strengthen its commitments to address climate change, according to The Peoples' Climate Vote 2024, conducted by the United Nations Development Programme and the University of Oxford. More than 73,000 people were surveyed in 77 countries, representing 87 per cent of the world's population. </p><p> For people in more climate-vulnerable regions and poorer nations, the number was even higher: 89 per cent wanted their country to strengthen its commitments to address climate change.</p><p> Separate research published in the journal Nature in 2024, based on a survey of nearly 130,000 people in 125 countries, including Singapore, found that 89 per cent demanded intensified political action. In fact, across parts of Asia, the figure was even higher. </p><p> In Singapore, it was 93 per cent; 96.2 per cent for Malaysia; 94.1 per cent in the Philippines; 97.1 per cent in China; 86.5 per cent for Indonesia; and 80 per cent for India. In the United States, it was 74 per cent. </p><p> Despite this, the researchers concluded that \"individuals around the globe systematically underestimate the willingness of their fellow citizens to act\".</p><p> In Singapore, there's growing support for climate action by individuals and businesses, Mr Menon said. The challenge was translating this support into concrete action. </p><p> \"Given the scale and complexity of the climate crisis, many individuals feel that their actions are too small to make an impact. Likewise, many businesses feel that if they move ahead on climate action, they may lose to their competitors who do not.\"</p><p> There was also a sense among many individuals and businesses that climate action is primarily the responsibility of the Government, he added.</p><p> Support, yes. But is it real'It's one thing to demand more action. But will people really follow through, or even know how to'</p><p> \"When you ask people about a big issue like climate change, people tend to think in abstract, value-driven terms, and at this level, they do think that climate change is important and want governments to do more,\" said Dr Jensen. </p><p> But if you ask them questions about trade-offs with other policy priorities, other uses of government revenues, then climate change does not come out on top, she added. </p><p> \"Just looking at the behavioural choices people make, you wouldn't know they cared much about climate change,\" she said. </p><p> That is in part due to the day-to-day economic priorities of people, especially in poorer nations where putting food on the table and paying bills are paramount. </p><p> \"That's the immediate reality. It's not that they don't care. It's not that they don't want clean air and clean water for their kids. They absolutely do,\" said Mr Hertsgaard.</p><p> Money and policiesDigging a bit deeper, doing something about climate action also requires better understanding of the right policies, said Dr Jensen. </p><p> While people may support stronger government action in general, most have low knowledge about which policies would be more or less effective in reducing emissions. This is where politicians must work harder to explain their policies -- especially climate policies that will affect people financially. </p><p> The money question is key. As the climate crisis worsens and governments have to enact tougher policies, are citizens willing to support them, such as budget cuts to key services to fund more green energy or climate adaptation projects, for instance, better flood defences? </p><p> What about making personal choices, such as taking public transport, eating less meat and flying less? </p><p> The 2024 Nature study found that 69 per cent of respondents said they would be willing to contribute 1 per cent of their household income every month to fight global warming (for Singapore, it was 53.1 per cent and 66.9 per cent in Malaysia). Just over a quarter said they would not be willing to contribute any amount. </p><p> Mr Hertsgaard said the economy will always come first for people. That's normal. But through its growing bread-and-butter impacts, climate change has become a top issue.</p><p> Let's talkThe simplest remedy to overcome the perception gap is to start talking to one another. </p><p> That's the message from climate scientist, educator and author Katharine Hayhoe.</p><p> \"I'm absolutely convinced that just about every single person has every reason they need to care about climate change already, and their reason might be different than yours or mine,\" she said in a YouTube message. </p><p> The key was joining the dots -- and here again, the media is key. \"We connect the dots between climate change and how it's affecting what we already care about, what already matters to us, and then we talk about how we really can fix this thing.\"</p><p> Talk to politicians, too. On July 9, more than 5,000 people from across Britain arrived in London to meet their MPs and demand urgent climate action to protect their communities. Before the event, a giant image created by The People's Picture, stating that \"89% of people want climate action\", was projected on the white cliffs of Dover.</p><p> We also need to take steps to cut our own carbon emissions, such as making our homes more energy efficient and cutting food and plastic waste. Not only does this give credibility to demands for greater climate action, but it will also help accelerate it and be a powerful message to politicians and businesses. </p><p> \"Effective climate action is all about collective effort,\" said Mr Menon. \"Government policies are a key enabler, but business strategies and individual actions are just as important.\"</p><p> 'Extraordinary mandate'The bottom line is that there is a huge and untapped resource to drive climate action. It is your friends, your family, your colleagues. </p><p> \"It is an extraordinary popular mandate. There is this 80 to 89 per cent of the population out there waiting for leaders to call them to action. It's 80 to 89 per cent, so it's an enormous opportunity for these activist groups, for politicians, to latch on to,\" said Mr Hertsgaard. </p><p> So what are you waiting for? Start talking to your neighbour. Chances are they care about climate change, too. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["This is where politicians must work harder to explain their policies -- especially climate policies that will affect people financially.

Good afternoon to all of you. It is my pleasure to join you today for the launch of the Alliance for Action (AfA) to co-create the Flood-Resilient Developments Guidebook.</p><p>Singapore's Efforts in Coastal and Flood Protection</p><p>2. Let me begin by thanking the members of the AfA committee who have kindly come forward to be part of this effort. The Flood Resilient Developments (FRD) guidebook is an important endeavour.</p><p>3. Singapore is a low-lying island state. About 30% of our land is less than 5m above mean sea level. This makes us vulnerable to flooding risks brought about by rising sea levels. These risks are exacerbated by storm surges and high tides.</p><p>4. Hence, we have taken a few important steps to strengthen our coastal and flood resilience.</p><p>5. First, we have demarcated our entire coastline into several hydraulically distinct segments and are progressively conducting site-specific studies to identify coastal adaptation solutions for each segment. The studies for Jurong Island, City-East Coast, including Long Island, as well as the northwest coast from Tuas to Woodlands are on track. We will commence the studies for Sentosa and the south-west coast by 2026.</p><p>6. Second, we are preparing coastal protection legislation to set out the responsibilities of coastal landowners, safeguard land for coastal protection measures and ensure that coastal protection standards are met. We will consult stakeholders and plan to table a Coastal Protection bill early in the new term of Parliament.</p><p>7. Third, we are approaching flood resilience from a systems perspective, not just to explore synergies between coastal and inland flood protection, but also to develop approaches where building owners, developers, engineers and architects play their part alongside the Government. This is where the FRD guidebook comes in.</p><p>8. Instead of prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach on how developments should achieve flood resilience, the FRD guidebook aims to set out principles and guidelines, including case studies. It encompasses a toolkit of measures that building owners can adopt at development level, without compromising the land use objectives. This provides designers and building owners with more room for flexibility and space for creativity in applying solutions that integrate best with the design intent.</p><p>9. Through the FRD, we hope to strike a balance between providing adequate and practical guidance to building and landowners to achieve effective flood resilience without being overly prescriptive and impeding creativity and customisation based on different needs and interests. Some cities in the United States and the Netherlands have also published similar guidelines.</p><p>Key Outcomes of the Alliance-for-Action</p><p>10. The new FRD guidebook will complement the upcoming Code of Practice for Coastal Protection as well as the existing Code of Practice on Surface Water Drainage, which collectively set out the design standards, and operational and maintenance requirements for coastal and flood protection infrastructure.</p><p>11. The AfA brings together multiple stakeholders to co-create and co-develop this FRD guidebook. We have experts from relevant professional bodies and associations. We hope to harness industry-wide experiences, best practices and strategies. It will essentially be a guidebook designed by practitioners for practitioners.</p><p>12. This close collaboration between the public and private sectors is essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of our long-term climate adaptation plans. It is heartening to see key industry leaders stepping forward to be part of this partnership, in contributing towards greater flood resilience for Singapore.</p><p>Closing</p><p>13. In closing, I look forward to the work of the AfA committee. I hope to see a FRD guidebook that will shape the way we design buildings with flood resilience in mind. Your contributions will help pave the way for a more climate-resilient Singapore, for the current and future generations.</p><p>14.

For one thing, it was among the few nations to meet the UN deadline for new climate targets. </p><p> Prime Minister Lawrence Wong also reaffirmed Singapore's commitment in the latest Budget statement, reiterating that the government \"remains resolute\" in its decarbonisation efforts, despite slowing momentum on the issue globally. </p><p> During Budget 2025, he also introduced a S$5 billion injection into the Future Energy Fund to secure clean power, alongside incentives to accelerate the adoption of zero-emissions heavy vehicles like electric goods vehicles and buses.</p><p> Mitigating risks</p><p>Singapore's commitment to decarbonisation is not only a far-sighted course of action, but also an act of great wisdom. </p><p> As climate change accelerates and extreme weather events become more common, governments that delay taking action now will face a far more challenging transition down the line.</p><p> When disasters like wildfires, floods, and heatwaves grow too frequent and severe to overlook, governments will be compelled to take drastic actions -- but at that point, it may already be too late to prevent the catastrophic consequences.</p><p> By addressing climate risks today, Singapore is not only preparing to handle future challenges proactively, but also positioning itself to capitalise on new opportunities in the burgeoning global awareness and seismic shift towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p> The city-state aims to cut emissions to between 45 million and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035. This is on top of an ambitious plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, through the Singapore Green Plan 2030. </p><p> This national strategy is anchored by five key pillars: city in nature; energy reset; sustainable living; green economy; and resilient future. </p><p> One focus of the Singapore Green Plan is about enhancing the city-state's liveability. </p><p> The government is expanding the rail and cycling networks, retrofitting buildings to be greener, and creating more parks and green spaces. Clear targets have also been set to cut landfill waste and reduce water usage.</p><p> These efforts not only advance the goal of creating sustainable, eco-friendly homes, but also fulfil residents' desires for a cleaner, healthier living environment.</p><p> Another key priority is transitioning to sustainable energy sources. Singapore aims to raise its solar energy deployment to 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, which would meet 3 per cent of the city-state's projected energy needs.</p><p> It also aims to slash emissions in the transport sector, by spurring the transition towards electric or low-emission vehicles across air, land, and sea.</p><p> Achieving these goals requires the right skilled talent to drive scientific innovation and bring new inventions to market. </p><p> Hence, the energy transition will create new job opportunities across various sectors including research, analytics, and finance.</p><p> Globally, the International Energy Agency projects the creation of 10.3 million new jobs by 2030 as the world shifts to cleaner energy. </p><p> In Singapore, the green economy is a key growth sector, with the national skills agency SkillsFuture identifying strong demand for highly adaptable and in-demand skills.</p><p> Aside from talent, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will also demand substantial investments. </p><p> This has led to the growth of sustainable finance, which is channelling significant new capital into the economy by supporting investments in infrastructure, expanding the green bond market, and fostering the development of carbon trading hubs.</p><p> A passing fad'</p><p> Some have questioned whether shifts in global climate policy and ongoing trade uncertainties might mean that sustainable finance is losing its relevance. However, this is far from the case.</p><p> While recent changes in trade policies may complicate supply chains for technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels, these challenges are also prompting governments to strengthen domestic capabilities and encouraging companies to localise their supply chains.</p><p>Singapore is not the only country advancing these efforts through a national climate policy platform. The European Union, for instance, aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050 through a set of policy initiatives put forth under the European Green Deal.</p><p> Further, even if the tempo of climate policy action may appear to be abating, some structural trends are here to stay.</p><p> Rapid urbanisation and population growth are set to double electricity demand globally over the next two decades.</p><p> Meeting this demand will require increased energy supplies, particularly from renewables.

The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for more than 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> Investments are also being made in emerging technologies. In 2024, OCBC participated in the project financing of a large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in the UK. CCS technologies are currently being explored in various markets in Asia.</p><p> The business case for sustainability Ng cautions that the risks of inaction against climate change remain high, especially in Asia, which is expected to bear the brunt of the physical consequences of climate change. \"We need to continue to pay attention, especially from a loan portfolio perspective, as part and parcel of sound risk management,\" he says.</p><p> Ng notes that despite the broader global turn against decarbonisation, governments in the region remain focused on the transition.</p><p> For example, in the markets where OCBC operates, policymakers continue to promote regulations and guidelines pertaining to transition planning, sustainability reporting and sustainable financing, among others.</p><p> The global backtracking by some institutions also presents a timely opportunity to take stock of current decarbonisation policies and regulations, says Ng.</p><p> For example, sustainability reporting has become a \"burdensome\" requirement for some firms, potentially distracting from meaningful climate action. In this context, the European Union's Omnibus package announced earlier this year aims to streamline sustainability regulations and ease compliance costs for companies, especially SMEs.</p><p> Ng also calls for a reassessment of the reference pathways -- which set out emission reduction targets and deadlines -- for underperforming sectors.</p><p> While a sector such as power is progressing well against its net-zero reference pathway due to the proliferation of renewable energy, others such as aviation and shipping are seeing slower progress due to the limited availability of green technology. This disparity suggests it may be time to recalibrate these pathways and targets.</p><p> \"Because the more unrealistic those reference pathways and targets remain, the less inclined financiers, investors and businesses will be to commit to them. Without targets, it will be hard to galvanise action,\" says Ng.</p><p> An opportune moment  for actionIn light of this, Ng believes it is all the more critical now to continue to encourage and support businesses to work towards their decarbonisation goals, rather than risk having them fall off the journey due to the difficulties.</p><p> \"OCBC remains committed to supporting our clients in their net-zero transition and sustainability goals with financing as well as knowledge and tools,\" he says.</p><p> The bank supports both large corporates and SMEs through three key areas: strategic advisory, innovative financial solutions and ecosystem partnerships.</p><p> For large companies, OCBC provides industry-specific advisory services, helping them quantify cost savings from undertaking emissions reduction initiatives and assess return on such investments.</p><p> The bank also extends financing to help them meet their sustainability goals.</p><p> Asia's partner for a sustainable futureIts leadership in sustainable finance is reflected in recent accolades. With a committed sustainable finance portfolio of S$71 billion, OCBC was ranked the top Mandated Lead Arranger for Green and Sustainability Linked Loans in both Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) and in South-east Asia by the London Stock Exchange Group last year.</p><p> OCBC also ranked eighth in Environmental Finance's 2024 Sustainability Coordinators League Table, which showcases the top banks leading the charge globally in sustainability coordinator deal activity and volume. OCBC was the only Singapore bank on the list.</p><p> For SMEs which lack the resources of larger firms, OCBC helps them understand the steps they can take to decarbonise and to access the capital needed to do so.</p><p> For example, in February this year, OCBC partnered Enterprise Singapore to launch the OCBC SME Start-ESG Programme, which helps SMEs measure sustainability metrics, receive expert advice and access sustainability-linked loans (SLL). Last year, more than 110 SME clients received such loans -- four times more than in 2023.</p><p> The bank also offers unique products, such as its first-in-market OCBC 1.5 degrees Celsius loan.

We also recognise that some investors may wish to explore and capitalise on advanced strategies to achieve specific impact or invest in specific themes. To meet these needs, we make ESG a core element of our investment thesis, aligning our strategies with both market realities and investor aspirations.</p><p>  One of the key considerations for investors when it comes to their investment decisions is the potential return. The recent increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape have tested investors' appetite to commit to sustainable investments since they are unsure about the future regulatory environment and the impact it may have on their investment returns.

Investments in solar, wind and battery storage systems are increasingly competitive against fossil fuel alternatives. More importantly, enablers such as smart grids and demand management technologies -- especially in high-growth urban centres -- are essential to stabilising renewable energy supply and unlocking further scale.</p><p> Mobility is another sector where climate action meets opportunity. Across Asia, countries are racing ahead in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, charging infrastructure and intelligent traffic systems. Innovations such as ultra-fast charging and connected transport systems are also improving convenience and range, spurring consumer adoption.</p><p> Investors are increasingly focused on mobility platforms, EV supply chains and battery recycling, all of which present strong growth prospects as urbanisation and climate pressure reshape how people and goods move across the region.</p><p> In the agriculture sector, South-east Asia's role as a major rice producer makes agricultural adaptation a top priority. Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods.</p><p> With strong social returns, such investments are increasingly attracting private capital, from agribusinesses investing in resilient seeds to impact investors funding water-saving irrigation technologies.</p><p> Another high-impact, cost-effective climate adaptation strategy is investing in nature-based solutions.</p><p> Restoring and protecting ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs and forests provides \"natural infrastructure\" that reduces disaster risks, regulates water flows, buffers heat and sequesters carbon.</p><p> For instance, mangrove restoration in Vietnam and the Philippines has proven effective in shielding coastal communities from storm surges. These solutions are relatively low-cost compared to traditional infrastructure such as concrete sea walls.</p><p> We are also seeing transition finance emerge as an investment theme, which is why we enhanced our Transition Finance Framework in 2025 -- to provide clients and stakeholders with greater clarity and transparency on eligible transition financing activities and enhance access to the financial resources required to accelerate climate action. This creates confidence not just for the bank but also for other ecosystem players.</p><p>  Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to gain traction as demand for clean power grows. Promising investment areas that address climate risks while delivering returns include:</p><p>  In its 2025 Supertrends Report, the chief investment office at our private banking subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, stated its view that the power-hungry nature of technology and the energy transition will accelerate over the medium term. This will be fuelled by the proliferation of AI use cases and the accelerating demand growth for electricity over the long term, driven by developments in the clean energy transition, electric mobility, cooling, data centres and AI sectors.</p><p> As improvements in energy efficiencies of data centres, cooling and power systems infrastructure will be required, the search for cleaner energy sources including solar, wind and nuclear technologies to supplement existing energy sources will present investment opportunities.</p><p> While the US has sidelined the green agenda for now, the global shift towards clean energy remains crucial for humanity's long-term survival and offers substantial economic and investment prospects. According to a World Economic Forum White Paper from 2023, an estimated additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and 232 million new jobs could be created in Asia by 2030 due to climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. We see opportunities in companies with exposure to clean energy and EVs, as well as transition enablers focused on smart grid infrastructure, energy storage and efficiency, and producers of metals and minerals.</p><p> Policy shifts have also enabled the oil and gas industry to be part of the energy transition, by leveraging technology -- bioenergy and carbon capture -- and the ability to manage complex energy systems.</p><p> From a geographical perspective, China in particular has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for over 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> Plugging the funding gap to mitigate climate risks is even more challenging today amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. What do you see as the most promising sources of capital that remain relatively untapped, and how can corporates help'</p><p> Despite the positive momentum described earlier, the financing gap for climate action in Asia remains daunting.</p><p> DBS estimates that over the next decade, the region will require approximately US$2.2 trillion for mitigation, US$2.5 trillion for adaptation, and a further 10 per cent of that total for resilience-related investments. In comparison, climate finance flows to South-east Asia from 2018 to 2019 totalled just US$27.8 billion annually. Even if this were to increase to US$50 billion annually, the shortfall over 10 years would still exceed US$4 trillion.</p><p> While the scale of capital needed is immense, it is not necessarily capital availability that is the issue -- rather, it is the lack of risk-adjusted returns that remain attractive enough to mobilise capital at scale. The priority must be on designing financing structures that shift the risk-return profile in favour of scalable investments.</p><p> This is where policy and regulatory frameworks become essential. Policymakers and regulators can create enabling environments through measures such as regulatory clarity on transition plans and incentives for green investments -- which can reduce uncertainty and improve the bankability of climate projects.</p><p> At the same time, financial innovation plays a pivotal role in unlocking new capital at a larger scale, such as concessionary and philanthropic capital. Structures like blended finance are particularly promising. They can de-risk early-stage projects, helping to crowd in commercial capital. For example, DBS inked a loan agreement alongside Karian Water Services, Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.</p><p> The loan went towards the development of a regional water supply system to deliver fresh water to around two million people across Jakarta, Tangerang and South Tangerang, marking the first blended finance transaction in the water sector in Indonesia.</p><p> We are also seeing the potential of transition credits to support decarbonisation pathways in hard-to-abate sectors. DBS co-leads a working group under the Transition Credits Coalition convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It seeks to catalyse the creation of high-integrity, transition-related carbon credits. A core focus is to support the early and managed phaseout of thermal coal power across Asia, paving the way for credible, just-transition pathways -- particularly in industrial and emissions-intensive sectors.</p><p> As both major asset holders and stakeholders in climate risk, insurers are well-positioned to play a dual role: investing in resilience infrastructure and integrating climate risks into underwriting and asset management. These areas remain relatively untapped, presenting a significant opportunity for impact.</p><p> Corporates also have a critical role to play. They can issue green and sustainability-linked bonds to fund climate-related activities, embed sustainability into procurement as corporates can stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services -- thereby indirectly channelling capital into green innovation -- and engage in transparent reporting aligned with international frameworks. These actions can help build investor confidence and attract ESG-focused capital.</p><p> A good example within Asean is Indonesia, where the funding gap for climate action is particularly prominent. To decarbonise its energy and transportation sectors, Indonesia requires an average investment of US$9.1 billion annually from 2018 to 2030. Under its national plan, the government allocated US$2.1 billion annually from 2020 to 2024, leaving a significant annual shortfall of US$7 billion. This highlights the potential of private financing in advancing climate action.</p><p> Corporates -- especially national banks in Indonesia -- can play a key role in mobilising private financing, as fossil fuels continue to receive a bigger share of private investment compared to renewable energy.</p><p>  There is ample liquidity in the system. Banks are still committed to financing green and transition projects and technologies. One often-cited problem lies in the bankability of such projects is the ability to generate enough cashflow to make it suitable for financing or to attract investors.</p><p> Central to the issue of bankability is risk allocation; allocating specific risks to the party most capable of managing and mitigating them is critical. For instance, in a utility project, having the project offtaker (often a state-owned utility company) take on regulatory risks or manage market demand risks by establishing long-term take-or-pay offtake agreements is one avenue for risk allocation.</p><p> Another problem contributing to the climate finance gap is the high cost of adoption. If the cost of a new green solution is several times that of a fossil fuel-based solution, it simply does not make economic sense for companies to adopt it. To overcome this, governments can consider implementing subsidies and regulations that lower the cost of adoption and stimulate demand in the process. When supply grows along with demand, the cost curves associated with the new technology come down. When the technology becomes economically viable, the financing gap naturally narrows.</p><p> Besides tapping traditional financing for climate finance, there are other funding mechanisms to consider. One is blended finance. Traditionally, blended finance structures have been deployed at the project level, with each individual project attracting capital from different providers including multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, export credit agencies, banks and others.</p><p> As each project has its own risk profile and characteristics, deployment of blended finance at the project level tends to be bespoke and time-consuming, making scalability a challenge.</p><p> To achieve scalability, blended finance structures can be deployed at the fund level which combines capital from multiple stakeholders with different risk-return requirements but with common impact objectives into a single investment scheme. The fund in turn allocates capital to the individual projects.</p><p> Funds have the flexibility to accommodate different risk-return profiles and objectives in the choice of capital providers and fund structure, as well as distribution waterfalls in the fund's documentation. Such flexibility enables the \"crowding in\" of additional capital from commercial investors, achieving scalability to deliver outcomes in areas such as energy transition, climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation.</p><p> An example is the MAS' Financing Asia's Transition Partnership initiative, which aims to use an initial injection of US$500 million by the Singapore Government to raise funding from other sources up to a projected US$5 billion.</p><p> The goal is to finance green projects in Asia focused on accelerating the energy transition, ramping up green investments, and decarbonising emissions-intensive sectors such as cement and steel production.</p><p> Another benefit of blended finance is the blending of knowledge and expertise. The diversity of the participants brings a wealth of knowledge which can be shared. For example, multilateral agencies could advise on governance structures, engage local policymakers in enhancing bankability of project documentation, or provide training on ESG standards. Fund managers bring with them the expertise to evaluate project risks and returns, and to structure the fund to cater to the different investor profiles.</p><p> This supplement was first published in The Business Times on June 5.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods.

In this context, the European Union's Omnibus package announced earlier this year aims to streamline sustainability regulations and ease compliance costs for companies, especially SMEs.</p><p> Ng also calls for a reassessment of the reference pathways -- which set out emission reduction targets and deadlines -- for underperforming sectors.</p><p> While a sector such as power is progressing well against its net-zero reference pathway due to the proliferation of renewable energy, others such as aviation and shipping are seeing slower progress due to the limited availability of green technology. This disparity suggests it may be time to recalibrate these pathways and targets.</p><p> \"Because the more unrealistic those reference pathways and targets remain, the less inclined financiers, investors and businesses will be to commit to them.

Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods. </p><p> With strong social returns, such investments are increasingly attracting private capital, from agribusinesses investing in resilient seeds to impact investors funding water-saving irrigation technologies.</p><p> Another high-impact, cost-effective climate adaptation strategy is investing in nature-based solutions. </p><p> Restoring and protecting ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs and forests provides \"natural infrastructure\" that reduces disaster risks, regulates water flows, buffers heat and sequesters carbon.</p><p>  For instance, mangrove restoration in Vietnam and the Philippines has proven effective in shielding coastal communities from storm surges. These solutions are relatively low-cost compared to traditional infrastructure such as concrete sea walls. </p><p> We are also seeing transition finance emerge as an investment theme, which is why we enhanced our Transition Finance Framework in 2025 -- to provide clients and stakeholders with greater clarity and transparency on eligible transition financing activities and enhance access to the financial resources required to accelerate climate action. This creates confidence not just for the bank but also for other ecosystem players.</p><p> Victor Wong: Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to gain traction as demand for clean power grows. Promising investment areas that address climate risks while delivering returns include:</p><p> Mike Ng: In its 2025 Supertrends Report, the chief investment office at our private banking subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, stated its view that the power-hungry nature of technology and the energy transition will accelerate over the medium term. This will be fuelled by the proliferation of AI use cases and the accelerating demand growth for electricity over the long term, driven by developments in the clean energy transition, electric mobility, cooling, data centres and AI sectors. </p><p> As improvements in energy efficiencies of data centres, cooling and power systems infrastructure will be required, the search for cleaner energy sources including solar, wind and nuclear technologies to supplement existing energy sources will present investment opportunities.</p><p> While the US has sidelined the green agenda for now, the global shift towards clean energy remains crucial for humanity's long-term survival and offers substantial economic and investment prospects. According to a World Economic Forum White Paper from 2023, an estimated additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and 232 million new jobs could be created in Asia by 2030 due to climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. We see opportunities in companies with exposure to clean energy and EVs, as well as transition enablers focused on smart grid infrastructure, energy storage and efficiency, and producers of metals and minerals. </p><p> Policy shifts have also enabled the oil and gas industry to be part of the energy transition, by leveraging technology -- bioenergy and carbon capture -- and the ability to manage complex energy systems.</p><p> From a geographical perspective, China in particular has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for over 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> BT: Plugging the funding gap to </p><p> mitigate climate risks is even more challenging today amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical </p><p> tensions. What do you see as the most promising sources of capital that remain relatively untapped, and how can corporates help? </p><p> Helge Muenkel: Despite the positive momentum described earlier, the financing gap for climate action in Asia remains daunting. </p><p> DBS estimates that over the next decade, the region will require approximately US$2.2 trillion for mitigation, US$2.5 trillion for adaptation, and a further 10 per cent of that total for resilience-related investments. In comparison, climate finance flows to South-east Asia from 2018 to 2019 totalled just US$27.8 billion annually. Even if this were to increase to US$50 billion annually, the shortfall over 10 years would still exceed US$4 trillion.</p><p> While the scale of capital needed is immense, it is not necessarily capital availability that is the issue -- rather, it is the lack of risk-adjusted returns that remain attractive enough to mobilise capital at scale. The priority must be on designing financing structures that shift the risk-return profile in favour of scalable investments. </p><p> This is where policy and regulatory frameworks become essential. Policymakers and regulators can create enabling environments through measures such as regulatory clarity on transition plans and incentives for green investments -- which can reduce uncertainty and improve the bankability of climate projects.</p><p> At the same time, financial innovation plays a pivotal role in unlocking new capital at a larger scale, such as concessionary and philanthropic capital. Structures like blended finance are particularly promising. They can de-risk early-stage projects, helping to crowd in commercial capital. For example, DBS inked a loan agreement alongside Karian Water Services, Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation. </p><p> The loan went towards the development of a regional water supply system to deliver fresh water to around two million people across Jakarta, Tangerang and South Tangerang, marking the first blended finance transaction in the water sector in Indonesia. </p><p> We are also seeing the potential of transition credits to support decarbonisation pathways in hard-to-abate sectors. DBS co-leads a working group under the Transition Credits Coalition convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It seeks to catalyse the creation of high-integrity, transition-related carbon credits. A core focus is to support the early and managed phaseout of thermal coal power across Asia, paving the way for credible, just-transition pathways -- particularly in industrial and emissions-intensive sectors.</p><p> Victor Wong: As both major asset holders and stakeholders in climate risk, insurers are well-positioned to play a dual role: investing in resilience infrastructure and integrating climate risks into underwriting and asset management. These areas remain relatively untapped, presenting a significant opportunity for impact.</p><p> Corporates also have a critical role to play. They can issue green and sustainability-linked bonds to fund climate-related activities, embed sustainability into procurement as corporates can stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services -- thereby indirectly channelling capital into green innovation -- and engage in transparent reporting aligned with international frameworks. These actions can help build investor confidence and attract ESG-focused capital. </p><p> A good example within Asean is Indonesia, where the funding gap for climate action is particularly prominent. To decarbonise its energy and transportation sectors, Indonesia requires an average investment of US$9.1 billion annually from 2018 to 2030. Under its national plan, the government allocated US$2.1 billion annually from 2020 to 2024, leaving a significant annual shortfall of US$7 billion. This highlights the potential of private financing in advancing climate action.</p><p> Corporates -- especially national banks in Indonesia -- can play a key role in mobilising private financing, as fossil fuels continue to receive a bigger share of private investment compared to renewable energy. </p><p> Mike Ng: There is ample liquidity in the system. Banks are still committed to financing green and transition projects and technologies. One often-cited problem lies in the bankability of such projects is the ability to generate enough cashflow to make it suitable for financing or to attract investors. </p><p> Central to the issue of bankability is risk allocation; allocating specific risks to the party most capable of managing and mitigating them is critical. For instance, in a utility project, having the project offtaker (often a state-owned utility company) take on regulatory risks or manage market demand risks by establishing long-term take-or-pay offtake agreements is one avenue for risk allocation. </p><p> Another problem contributing to the climate finance gap is the high cost of adoption. If the cost of a new green solution is several times that of a fossil fuel-based solution, it simply does not make economic sense for companies to adopt it. To overcome this, governments can consider implementing subsidies and regulations that lower the cost of adoption and stimulate demand in the process. When supply grows along with demand, the cost curves associated with the new technology come down. When the technology becomes economically viable, the financing gap naturally narrows. </p><p> Besides tapping traditional financing for climate finance, there are other funding mechanisms to consider. One is blended finance. Traditionally, blended finance structures have been deployed at the project level, with each individual project attracting capital from different providers including multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, export credit agencies, banks and others.</p><p>  As each project has its own risk profile and characteristics, deployment of blended finance at the project level tends to be bespoke and time-consuming, making scalability a challenge.</p><p> To achieve scalability, blended finance structures can be deployed at the fund level which combines capital from multiple stakeholders with different risk-return requirements but with common impact objectives into a single investment scheme. The fund in turn allocates capital to the individual projects. </p><p> Funds have the flexibility to accommodate different risk-return profiles and objectives in the choice of capital providers and fund structure, as well as distribution waterfalls in the fund's documentation. Such flexibility enables the \"crowding in\" of additional capital from commercial investors, achieving scalability to deliver outcomes in areas such as energy transition, climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation. </p><p> An example is the MAS' Financing Asia's Transition Partnership initiative, which aims to use an initial injection of US$500 million by the Singapore Government to raise funding from other sources up to a projected US$5 billion. </p><p> The goal is to finance green projects in Asia focused on accelerating the energy transition, ramping up green investments, and decarbonising emissions-intensive sectors such as cement and steel production.</p><p> Another benefit of blended finance is the blending of knowledge and expertise. The diversity of the participants brings a wealth of knowledge which can be shared. For example, multilateral agencies could advise on governance structures, engage local policymakers in enhancing bankability of project documentation, or provide training on ESG standards. Fund managers bring with them the expertise to evaluate project risks and returns, and to structure the fund to cater to the different investor profiles. </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods.

A very good evening to all of you. It is a pleasure to join you at the 8th DutchCham Winsemius Awards. This award honours the outstanding achievements of Dutch and Singaporean companies in business, innovation, sustainability and social impact - values that reflect the enduring legacy of Dr Albert Winsemius.</p><p>2. Many here would know Dr Winsemius as the Dutch economist who helped guide Singapore's early economic development. He saw possibilities where others saw limitations. Today, his legacy of vision, partnership and enterprise continues to inspire us.</p><p>3. The first Winsemius Awards event in 2015 was initiated to celebrate 50 years of Singapore's independence. In the year of SG60, I am delighted to be here this evening to celebrate a decade of enduring bonds between the Singapore and Dutch business communities. My warmest congratulations to all the finalists and winners tonight.</p><p>Celebrating 60 years of strong partnership</p><p>4. This evening holds special significance, as we mark 60 years of diplomatic ties between Singapore and the Netherlands, and 35 years of DutchCham's presence in Singapore.</p><p>5. Almost 2,000 Dutch companies have set up businesses here, contributing to our growth across healthcare, semiconductors, maritime, engineering, food, and more. Together, we have built globally connected ports, developed smart urban ecosystems, and advanced pioneering solutions in renewable energy and the circular economy.</p><p>6. The Netherlands is now Singapore's second largest EU investor and third largest goods trading partner. In turn, amongst EU Member States, the Netherlands is the second largest investment destination for Singapore companies.</p><p>7. Our partnership thrives because we share common values ofopenness, innovation, and a commitment to sustainable growth. Just within this year, we renewed the Singapore-Rotterdam Cooperation Agreement on maritime sustainability and also deepened cooperation in the semiconductor and other high-tech sectors. These are testaments of our shared ambitions to strengthen our pathfinding roles as respective gateways to Europe and ASEAN.</p><p>Looking ahead to the next 60 years</p><p>8. As we celebrate these milestones, it's timely to look ahead and reflect on what the next 60 years of Singapore-Netherlands collaboration could bring.</p><p>9. True to Dr Winsemius' spirit of turning constraints into opportunities, Singapore and the Netherlands have consistently sought to punch above our weight on the global stage. As we stand at the crossroads of a new global era - defined by digital transformation, decarbonisation, and geopolitical uncertainty, our cooperation as like-minded partners have never been more relevant.</p><p>10. Looking ahead, I see potential for deeper partnership in four critical areas:</p><p>a. First, in the green and digital transitions. From scaling up renewable energy to harnessing AI for smarter cities, Dutch innovations in areas like offshore wind and quantum computing pair naturally with Singapore's efforts to green our energy sources and build digital economies.</p><p>b. Second, climate adaptation and water management remain priority issues where the Netherlands leads globally. Singapore values this partnership as we strengthen our own urban resilience and coastal protection strategies.</p><p>c. Third, circular economy.</p><p>Both countries are advancing sustainable urban living - from boosting food resilience to turning waste into resources. Thereis rich potential for our businesses, researchers and policymakers to co-develop solutions that make sustainability a reality today.</p><p>d. Lastly, as global supply chains face growing pressures from climate risks and geopolitics, Singapore and the Netherlands - as trusted, connected trading hubs - can collaborate to reinforce supply chain resilience and build next-generation digital trade networks.</p><p>Celebrating the power of communities</p><p>11. In a rapidly changing world, the importance of building strong, connected communities remains a constant. It is these communities, across cities, industries and borders, that create lasting impact. Both Singapore and the Netherlands understand that it is not just about economic growth, but about building societies where people feel included, valued, and empowered.</p><p>12. That is why I am especially honoured to present the Winsemius Community Impact Award tonight. This Award recognises companies that go beyond business to uplift communities, lead with integrity, and create meaningful contributions to our society. It reminds us that true leadership lies not just in profit, but in purpose.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>13. This is why partners like DutchCham matter. Beyond a business network, you provide a bridge to connect ideas, people and possibilities. It reminds us that the strength of our economic relationship lies not only in business transactions, but the depth of trust and mutual understanding that underpin them.</p><p>14. This is very much like Dr Winsemius' relationship with theearly generation of Singaporean leaders, which lasted more than two decades. Even after his formal appointment had ended, Dr Winsemius continued to give counsel and keep informed about the Government's activities.</p><p>15. In many ways, it was this man who had the vision to spot a place like Singapore, which, at that time, was a developing and poor country, with very little resources and an imbalanced market, and one that not many people were paying attention to.</p><p>a. And yet, Dr Winsemius saw something in us, something that was different and valuable. He brought in companies like Philips, which started its lightbulb business in Jurong. Along with the investments in transistor radios, toothbrushes, and textiles, this era marked the beginning of Singapore's industrialisation.</p><p>b. Dr Winsemius' leadership and vision, along with that of our early leaders, developed Singapore into what it is today. Most importantly, they imparted important values which the Government still embraces today, such as hard work, openness, incorruptibility, doing business the right way, and being hard-headed.</p><p>c. As we are open to investments and competition, Singapore must always strive to be better.</p><p>Collaboration and partnership will continue to be a very important part of Singapore - a regional hub for business, finance, and innovation.</p><p>16. So, thank you all for your kindness that you have shown to Singapore. Thank you for your investments in Singapore,and thank you for levelling up the capability of our local workforce and also uplifting the local community.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Trade and Industry, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Awards and Recognitions, Events]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["From scaling up renewable energy to harnessing AI for smarter cities, Dutch innovations in areas like offshore wind and quantum computing pair naturally with Singapore's efforts to green our energy sources and build digital economies. b.

A very good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you today to the FAST Conference 2025.First, please let me acknowledge our partners for the FAST conference, Mr Cheng Wai Keung, Deputy Chairman of Temasek and Ms Susan Chan, Head of Asia Pacific of BlackRock.</p><p>2. We are facing a more uncertain path ahead for climate action than at any time in the last five years:</p><p>* There is greater uncertainty in global commitments to timely transition.</p><p>*Global private sector coalitions for climate action are also seeing a pullback. Many financial institutions have withdrawn from net zero alliances, and these alliances themselves have revised their objectives.</p><p>Global corporate investment more generally may also turn more cautious amid heightened trade and economic uncertainty.</p><p>3. On the positive side:</p><p>*COP29 saw broad agreement to enhance cooperation in such areas as carbon markets and climate adaptation, as well as new goals to channel financing to developing countries;</p><p>*Many countries have submitted their 2035 NDCs, reaffirming a steady pathway towards their net zero goals; and</p><p>*Many major financial institutions have affirmed continued commitment to their net zero targets.</p><p>4. We are meeting at a critical time. It is now even more important to bring together leaders across policy, finance and the real economy, to advance concrete approaches and solutions that will maintain the course for climate action and the region's transition to a climate-resilient and nature-positive future.</p><p>Enabling the Energy Transition in Asia</p><p>5. In Asia, enabling energy transition will be key to transitioning our economies.</p><p>Asia's demand for electricity is projected to rise at an annual rate of 4% until 2035[1], driven by end-use sectors such as transport, industry and buildings.</p><p>6. While energy demand is still growing, the good news is that in parts of Asia, renewable energy already makes up a significant share of the energy mix, supported by falling costs.</p><p>* Wind and solar generation capacity in China has already exceeded fossil fuel-based thermal power capacity for the first time in March this year.</p><p>*Countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia are also seeing lower renewable energy costs than that of coal-generated energy.[2]</p><p>7. There is an opportunity to drive the deployment of renewable energy and develop the infrastructure and solutions to support growth in Asian economies in a sustainable and resilient manner.</p><p>*The IEA expects renewable energy to supply more than half of Asia's increased electricity demand.[3]</p><p>*The increase in demand for electricity will catalyse a corresponding demand for supporting infrastructure and solutions. Earlier this year, ASEAN foreign ministers reaffirmed the commitment to operationalise the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) by 2045.</p><p>*Almost S$1.1 trillion in financing is estimated to be needed over the next decade to ramp up renewable energy capacity, upgrade existing power grid infrastructure, and invest in battery storage systems.[4]</p><p>8. Singapore hopes to do more to catalyse the scaling up of renewables power generation and their enabling infrastructure in Asia.</p><p>*Over the years, Singapore has supported partners across the entire infrastructure value chain, serving as the regional base to many international infrastructure development companies, project finance teams of global financial institutions, as well as multilateral development banks such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</p><p>9. We have also put in place key initiatives to enable the financing of Asia's energy transition.</p><p>10. First, we have provided clear and credible definitions through the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy (SAT) on what are green and transition activities, including activities within the Energy Sector.</p><p>*Specifically, for electricity generation using renewables such as solar PV and wind, the SAT sets out thresholds and criteria for classifying such activities as \"green\" or \"transition\".</p><p>*There has been good adoption amongst financial institutions and corporates of the SAT since its launch. Financial products have been developed based on the SAT's classifications, portfolios have been aligned with the SAT's criteria and corporate sustainability strategies have been formulated with reference to the SAT.</p><p>11. We are also bringing partners together through blended finance platforms to co-create solutions for the region, de-risk investments, and catalyse the flow of private capital, for energy transition projects.</p><p>*We launched the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) in end-2023 to raise up to US$5 billion to support Asia's decarbonisation and climate resilience.</p><p>*Within the FAST-P platform, the Green Investment Partnership (GIP), managed by Pentagreen Capital, will be ready to commence deployment in the coming months. They will mobilise capital for marginally bankable clean energy infrastructure in Asia.</p><p>*I am also glad to share that a FAST-P office, with a dedicated management team, will soon be set up to facilitate the deployment of up to US$500 million of concessional capital from the Singapore Government into the three FAST-P partnerships, alongside capital from other partners. The office will continue to work closely with asset managers, banks, and commercial and concessional investors, to promote innovative blended finance solutions for sustainable infrastructure in the region.</p><p>12. These are important milestones, but we recognise that an ecosystem approach - regulators, businesses, and financial institutions coming together - will continue to be needed to overcome these challenges. MAS will continue to work closely with the industry to develop solutions to support the region's energy transition.</p><p>Developing High Integrity Carbon Markets</p><p>13. A second area of focus for Singapore is the development of high integrity carbon markets.There are situations where the economic case for climate projects may not be well-established, making it difficult to crowd in investors and capital. High-integrity and well-functioning carbon markets can play an important role, to strengthen the economic case for decarbonisation and channel much needed capital towards worthwhile projects.</p><p>14. There have been headwinds in the last few years, but recent developments such as the finalisation of Article 6 rules at COP29, and the growing industry acceptance of meta-standards such as the ICVCM's[5] Core Carbon Principles, are helping to build confidence in carbon markets.</p><p>15. Shaping a well-functioning global carbon market will require progress in the areas of (i) supply of high-integrity credits; (ii) strong demand for credits; and (iii) robust market infrastructure and capabilities. At the GenZero Climate Summit Insights earlier this week, 2nd Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng spoke about the work the Singapore Government is undertaking to address these gaps, including through developing common standards, crowding in financing, and building capabilities.</p><p>16. The Transition Credits Coalition convened by the MAS is also an important initiative that seeks to address some of these gaps in the carbon markets.</p><p>*In its interim report launched at COP29 last year, TRACTION outlined common key high-integrity attributes across various methodologies and frameworks for the early retirement of coal and its replacement with clean energy. It also identified the transaction risks and possible risk mitigation solutions, and motivations of different buyer profiles.</p><p>17. Building on these findings, TRACTION has identified the market and technical conditions where transition credits have the greatest potential to make an impact. This will enable the industry to prioritise a pipeline of suitable transition credits projects.</p><p>18. TRACTION has also identified the key components of a Just Transition associated with the early retirement of coal plants, to guide project owners and financial institutions to address the socio-economic impacts of coal plant closures on workers and communities.</p><p>19. These findings help foster a common understanding of high-integrity and viable transition credit transactions, enhancing the scalability of transition credits as a mechanism to crowd in financing for energy transition.</p><p>20. I would also highlight the work of the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA). The SSFA is collaborating with the Singapore Government to develop guidance for companies on the credible usage of carbon credits alongside a decarbonisation plan. They are also developing solutions to deepen carbon project financing and collaborating with ASEAN counterparts on the ASEAN Common Carbon Framework.</p><p>21. MAS, together with the SSFA, are now considering initiatives to further support financial institutions' participation in carbon markets.</p><p>Strengthening Climate and Nature Resilience in the Financial Sector</p><p>22. Let me move on to a growing area of importance, that of adaptation and resilience. As the physical impact of climate change intensifies, there are mounting risks posed by both climate change and nature loss - risks that have cascading effects across sectors, markets, and value chains.</p><p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) intends to consider more closely how climate-related physical risks can pose threats to financial stability.<br/><br/>MAS took early steps in 2020 to embed resilience in the financial system, by issuing a set of Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management (ENRM). These set out expectations for robust governance, risk management, and disclosures related to environmental risks.</p><p>Our financial institutions have also started to enhance the resilience of their portfolios to climate and nature risks. For example, by integrating physical climate risk into their internal credit risk models, asset valuation, and due diligence processes. Doing so will enable them to better anticipate and manage financial loss, minimise stranded assets, and uncover new financing and investment opportunities.</p><p>23. There is growing interest in how nature loss and ecosystem degradation can amplify the effects of climate change and put nature-dependent value chains at risk. It is timely that the SSFA, in partnership with Oliver Wyman, launched a white paper two weeks ago, titled \"Financing Our Natural Capital.\"</p><p>*The whitepaper contextualises global frameworks to our region, identifies sectors of high priority from a nature materiality lens, and provides practical steps for financial institutions to incorporate nature into their business activity.</p><p>24. Beyond managing their own environmental risk, financial institutions play an essential role in mobilising capital towards solutions that enhance the adaptive capacity of economies and communities.</p><p>*The insurance industry in particular has a key role in developing risk financing solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies, to reduce the risk of such projects for commercial investors.</p><p>*Several international insurance brokers have built specialised capabilities in Singapore to support and develop such risk financing solutions, through risk analytics and advisory for physical climate risk, energy transition investments, and carbon and nature markets.</p><p>25. Ultimately, financial institutions can respond on two fronts: by managing exposure to growing climate and nature-related risks, and by innovating to finance and de-risk adaptation, resilience, and nature-positive solutions.</p><p>Staying the Course and Building the Future</p><p>26. There are near-term uncertainties about the global momentum for climate action, but Asia can continue to chart a steady course in its transition. Policymakers, financial institutions, and corporates alike should take the long view, stay the course, and invest in the infrastructure, solutions, and capabilities that will enable industries and economies to transition. In doing so, we will unlock new opportunities for growth, create jobs, build resilient economies and make possible a more resilient future for all of us.</p><p>27.

The shift left a leadership vacuum that many expected China to fill, given its significant investments in renewable energy and its ambitious net zero goal. However, recent developments, including China\u2019s missed emission targets in 2024, suggest that China may not yet be ready to assume the mantle of global climate leadership.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        Difficult balancing act: economy and environmental commitments</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        China\u2019s climate strategy has been characterised by ambitious pledges, such as achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and peaking carbon emissions before 2030. These commitments are supported by substantial investments in renewable energy technologies, positioning China as a leader in the global green transition effort. However, the reality of meeting these targets has proven challenging. </p><p>                        This shortfall underscores the difficulties China faces in balancing its economic growth with its environmental commitments.</p><p>                        In 2024, China\u2019s carbon intensity, a measurement of carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), fell by only 3.4%, missing the official target of 3.9%. China is also behind its five-year goal of slashing carbon intensity by 18% between 2020 and 2025. </p><p>                        This shortfall underscores the difficulties China faces in balancing its economic growth with its environmental commitments. As China\u2019s GDP is decelerating, the government needs to cut emissions more aggressively to achieve the carbon intensity target set previously.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>                        A view shows a protest projection set up by Greenpeace activists onto the wall of the US Embassy in Berlin against Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, in Berlin, Germany, on 21 January 2025.</p><p>                        In recent years, the reliance on industrial growth to recover from the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to increased energy demand and, consequently, higher emissions in China. This situation is compounded by domestic coal consumption, which remains a significant barrier to its climate leadership aspirations. </p><p>                        Despite pledges to halt overseas coal projects, domestic coal burning still accounts for more than half of China\u2019s energy consumption and two-thirds of its electricity output. This reliance on coal poses a challenge to China\u2019s ability to drastically reduce emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources.\u00a0</p><p>                        Emerging as the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle (EV) market and producer, China needs to charge its EVs with electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar rather than coal burning. Otherwise, the carbon footprints of these EVs may be even larger than cars with gasoline engines.</p><p>                        Achieving carbon neutrality will require significant reforms in China\u2019s energy sector and broader economy, which may not occur until after 2035.</p><p>                        Significant reforms needed</p><p>                        While China has made remarkable achievements in the development of renewable energy like wind, solar and hydro power, the pace of structural changes needed to fully transition away from coal is far from satisfactory. Achieving carbon neutrality will require significant reforms in China\u2019s energy sector and broader economy, which may not occur until after 2035. This timeline raises questions about China\u2019s ability to lead global climate efforts in the near term.</p><p>                        A man walks before wind turbines of Chinese company Goldwind in Zhangjiakou, northern China\u2019s Hebei province on 26 March 2025.</p><p>                        Despite the current US administration\u2019s climate position, it is important for China to maintain climate and energy cooperation with the US and the EU, which helps the country improve its image and potentially seek global leadership. However, China\u2019s current domestic challenges and missed targets indicate that it may not yet be ready to fully assume this role. The international community will continue to closely watch China\u2019s mitigation actions, as its success or failure will have significant implications for global efforts to combat climate change.</p><p>                        Moreover, China\u2019s geopolitical strategies and economic policies add complexity to its climate leadership ambitions. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), while promoting infrastructure development, has been criticised for supporting projects that may not align with global mitigation or adaptation goals. The initiative\u2019s prioritisation of economic expansion sometimes overshadows environmental considerations, posing a challenge to China\u2019s ability to lead by example in climate efforts.</p><p>                        Domestic concerns may impede China\u2019s global climate leadership role</p><p>                        China\u2019s approach to climate leadership is further complicated by its domestic socioeconomic priorities. Although the key is to have sustainable and green growth, the government\u2019s need to maintain a 5% GDP growth in 2025 may take precedence over environmental concerns. This prioritisation can lead to policy decisions that favour short-term economic gains over long-term sustainability, affecting China\u2019s credibility as a climate leader. Lack of an active civil society that supports environmental activism and supervises government and corporate behaviours is weakening the country\u2019s ability to take costly but necessary mitigation actions.\u00a0</p><p>                        China, with the world\u2019s second largest computing power scale, witnesses an annual growth of 15% in its data centres\u2019 power usage, which accounts for about 4% of the national electricity consumption in 2025.</p><p>                        Additionally, the energy and environmental impact of China\u2019s technological advancements in AI-driven solutions is contingent on the integration of more low-carbon energy into the local energy networks. China, with the world\u2019s second largest computing power scale, witnesses an annual growth of 15% in its data centres\u2019 power usage, which accounts for about 4% of the national electricity consumption in 2025.</p><p>                        Paradoxically, the role of AI in optimising intermittent renewable energy supply and improving energy efficiency is also a critical component of China\u2019s climate strategy.\u00a0</p><p>                        People walk past a shopping mall complex during a polluted day in Beijing on 1 March 2025.</p><p>                        AI advancements could aid climate adaptation and mitigation</p><p>                        China\u2019s technological advancements in AI offer potential solutions for climate adaptation and mitigation. AI can optimise renewable energy production, improve energy efficiency and provide actionable insights for governance, enabling data-driven policymaking for more effective interventions aimed at addressing inclusive growth issues. This scalable model for energy efficiency shows promise, but its implementation on a national scale in China is still nascent.</p><p>                        China\u2019s collaboration with other nations is crucial for the country\u2019s climate leadership. Engaging China for sustainability in Asia requires partnership and cooperation among Asian and Western economies. Solidifying mutual trust through cooperation on shared interests like climate change and green economic transition is essential for China to enhance its leadership role. </p><p>                        With the absence of the US, global actions against climate change urgently need the unity and consensus between China and other major players like the EU and ASEAN. China needs to kickstart strategic dialogues with these blocs on climate and energy issues as soon as possible.\u00a0</p><p>                        China\u2019s interest in low-carbon energy sectors in Southeast Asia a boon</p><p>                        China\u2019s ambition to become a major provider of capital, construction services, and equipment to low-carbon energy sectors in Southeast Asia is another facet of its potential climate leadership. Chinese companies have been active in energy-related construction services, equipment, and investments in conventional energy projects, including low-carbon hydropower and grid construction. The transition from conventional to new energy projects has just started, and the pace of this transition will significantly impact China\u2019s ability to lead in global climate efforts.</p><p>                        While China has made strides in green transition, its missed emissions targets and ongoing reliance on coal suggest that it is still not prepared to take on global climate leadership.</p><p>                        The sun rises over solar panels at a village in Taizhou, in China\u2019s eastern Jiangsu province on 26 March 2025.</p><p>                        The falling costs of solar and wind energy, partly driven by low-cost manufacturing of related products in China, have energised the expansion of renewables globally. This trend has been particularly evident in many Western countries, where the cost of installing solar and wind generators has decreased significantly, making them more competitive with traditional energy sources. China\u2019s role in driving down these costs highlights its potential to influence global renewable energy markets positively. Nevertheless, the tariffs levied by President Trump are complicating the global supply chain issue and weakening China\u2019s role as the major supplier of renewable energy equipment.\u00a0</p><p>                        While China has made strides in green transition, its missed emissions targets and ongoing reliance on coal suggest that it is still not prepared to take on global climate leadership. The international community needs to press China for more aggressive actions home and abroad, as its success or failure will have significant implications for global efforts to combat climate change. China\u2019s journey towards climate leadership is a complex interplay of domestic challenges, technological advancements and international relations, all of which must be navigated carefully to achieve substantial progress.</p><p>                        Related: Trump 2.0 will slow, not kill, the global energy transition | Tan Min Yih: How Shell Mobility gets ready for a green future</p><p>                        This picture shows the coal-powered Datang International Zhangjiakou Power Station in Zhangjiakou, in China\u2019s northern Hebei province on 15 November 2021.</p>", "publisher": "ThinkChina", "instances": ["Paradoxically, the role of AI in optimising intermittent renewable energy supply and improving energy efficiency is also a critical component of China\u2019s climate strategy.

Au noted that some companies are already increasing their resilience by identifying risks in their supply chains and addressing, diversifying or shortening them. \"The market will increasingly favour forward-looking companies that prioritise sustainability and are mitigating and adapting to climate change for a robust supply chain,\" said KPMG's Somani.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["The Global Stocktake report found that financial support for adaptation continues to fall far behind mitigation investments.

Neha Bhatia, partner for ESG and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, said that beyond developing a baseline framework or policy guidelines from which adaptation projects can take off, governments can provide the first layer of capital to absorb the initial risk before partnering multilateral development banks, or local development financial institutions, for the next layer of developmental capital.", "However, the share of total climate-specific financial support has grown to 28 per cent between 2019 and 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous two-year period.

He added that such collaborative models spread the costs and risks of change over several different actors. The bias is evident given that the private sector's contribution to adaptation measures stood at just 2 per cent of the global adaptation spend, according to data collated by non-profit outfit Climate Policy Initiative, he noted.

Lawyers are making their presence felt in this electoral cycle. This pattern invites a deeper examination of what these legal minds bring to Singapore's governance, and why their participation matters for the nation's future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A tradition of legal expertise in politicsSingapore's politics has historically welcomed legal professionals, beginning with founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, himself Cambridge-trained in law. This tradition continues with current stalwarts like K Shanmugam, who has served as minister for law since 2008; Edwin Tong, minister for culture, community and youth; Indranee Rajah, minister in the Prime Minister's Office and second minister for finance; and Murali Pillai, minister of state for transport and law. All of them are senior counsels. </p><p> In the history of Singapore, only 100 senior counsels have ever been appointed. Beyond these distinguished senior legal figures, many other lawyers have made significant contributions to governance, including Desmond Lee, who has served as minister for national development since 2020. Their contributions have demonstrated how legal training can translate effectively to governance.</p><p> The current election sees this tradition evolving with fresh faces. The PAP's new candidates who are lawyers include Gho Sze Kee (shipping lawyer), Cassandra Lee (who has legal expertise in corporate matters) and Marshall Lim (former deputy public prosecutor). </p><p> They join PAP members like Alex Yeo, Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Christopher de Souza, Hany Soh, Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Patrick Tay, Rahayu Mahzam and Vikram Nair in bringing diverse legal perspectives into the political arena. A quick count reveals that the PAP is fielding at least 16 out of 97 candidates who are legally trained in GE2025. </p><p> On the opposition front, the WP has fielded several lawyers as new candidates, including Sufyan Mikhail Putra, Alia Mattar, Fadli Fawzi and Harpreet Singh (who is a senior counsel), while Andre Low holds a law degree. They join other legally trained experienced candidates including Dennis Tan, He Ting Ru, Sylvia Lim and party leader Pritam Singh. That is nine of the 26 candidates the WP is fielding in this election. </p><p> Other opposition parties have also fielded lawyers, such as Lim Tean of Peoples Voice and Stephanie Tan of the Progress Singapore Party. </p><p> What lawyers uniquely contributeEach represents not just legal acumen, but specialised knowledge in different legal domains that could inform various aspects of legislation. </p><p> Legal professionals bring distinct advantages to parliamentary service. Their training fosters precise analytical thinking, and the ability to identify unforeseen consequences in policy proposals. Years of practice in constructing and challenging arguments prepare them to scrutinise legislation with thoroughness and rigour that can improve legislative outcomes.</p><p> For example, Edwin Tong's path from senior counsel to ministry leadership demonstrates how legal expertise transfers to policy implementation. His experience handling complex commercial cases equipped him with the skills to navigate multifaceted policy challenges, particularly in culturally sensitive domains where principles must be carefully balanced against pragmatic considerations.</p><p> Legal training also emphasises the importance of procedural fairness and accountability. Lawyers understand that how decisions are made can be as important as the decisions themselves -- an insight that strengthens democratic institutions. </p><p>  A bridge between policy and implementationThe prevalence of lawyers in Singapore's political landscape speaks to the unique position they occupy between policy formation and practical implementation. </p><p> Take Marshall Lim's background as a former deputy public prosecutor. This experience provides first-hand insight into how criminal justice policies affect real people and communities. Similarly, shipping lawyers like Gho Sze Kee understand the implications of maritime regulations on Singapore's status as a global port and trading hub.</p><p> This practical dimension means legally trained politicians can anticipate implementation challenges and design more effective legislation. Their experience navigating regulatory frameworks allows them to construct policies that achieve intended aims while minimising unintended consequences. </p><p> Furthermore, legal professionals are bound by strict ethical codes that emphasise integrity, independence and duty to uphold justice. When these values transfer to political service, they can strengthen governance standards. </p><p> Another valuable dimension lawyers bring to politics is their training in clear, persuasive communication. The ability to distil complex issues into understandable terms and construct compelling arguments serves politicians well in both parliamentary debate and public engagement.</p><p> Currently, the PAP has four senior counsels running in GE2025, and the WP has one. The senior counsel appointment represents the pinnacle of Singapore's legal profession -- recognition of exceptional ability, knowledge and integrity. When these distinguished jurists enter politics, they bring unparalleled depth of expertise in constitutional matters, regulatory frameworks and complex legal considerations that affect national policy.</p><p> Their presence on either side of the political divide signals the importance all parties place on high-calibre legal thinking in addressing Singapore's challenges. </p><p> Professional diversitySingapore benefits most from a Parliament that reflects diverse professional backgrounds. The complexity of issues facing the nation -- from technological disruption to climate adaptation -- demands varied expertise. Engineers bring technical innovation, educators understand social development, healthcare professionals grasp public health priorities, and business leaders comprehend economic realities.</p><p> The ideal Parliament is not dominated by any single profession, but rather harnesses complementary perspectives. Lawyers who recognise this understand their role is not to monopolise discourse, but to contribute their specialised skills within a broader collaborative framework.</p><p> As Singapore navigates increasingly complex challenges -- from digital regulation to geopolitical positioning -- legally trained parliamentarians will play a vital role in crafting sophisticated responses. Their ability to parse nuanced implications, anticipate legal challenges and draft precise legislation provides a foundation for effective governance. The number of lawyers contesting in GE2025 reflects recognition of these challenges. </p><p> For Singaporean voters, this trend offers the promise of rigorous debate and well-considered policy. The presence of legal professionals across party lines ensures that regardless of electoral outcomes, the nation's laws will benefit from informed scrutiny and principled development -- a cornerstone of Singapore's continued prosperity and stability.</p><p> The writer is a law lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, a visiting fellow in law at the University of Reading and a practising lawyer at RHTLaw Asia</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Their presence on either side of the political divide signals the importance all parties place on high-calibre legal thinking in addressing Singapore's challenges.

Public-sector spending is nowhere near the amount required. On the other hand, private-sector capital is profit-driven, and therefore has no appetite for large swathes of adaptation projects. The recently released synthesis report of the Paris Agreement's Global Stocktake -- the first worldwide progress review of the 2015 climate pact -- found that the world is still short of where it needs to be to avoid catastrophic global temperatures. The current rate of warming and the prospect of even higher temperatures have made it imperative to not merely try to arrest global warming, but also to address its impact until we can right the ship. </p><p> \"Owing to climate-related and other factors, loss and damage is already being observed and risks are growing, meaning that enhancing action and support for averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage is urgently needed,\" the report stated.</p><p> The 2022 Adaptation Gap report by the United Nations Environment Programme estimated that annual adaptation needs are between US$160 billion and US$340 billion by 2030, growing to between US$315 billion and US$565 billion by 2050. Yet international adaptation finance for developing countries was just US$28.6 billion in 2020, a fraction of what is needed.</p><p> It is tempting, wherever a financing gap exists, to immediately find a private-sector solution. Indeed, numerous initiatives such as the Adaptation and Resilience Investors Collaborative, the Principles for Responsible Banking and the Global Impact Investor Network have all been trying to increase private flows into adaptation. But as the Adaptation report put it, \"private-sector finance for adaptation is not a panacea\".</p><p> The fundamental problem is that private capital must deliver financial returns to its owners. What is profitable and low-risk is a subset of what is needed, and not necessarily what is most urgent. Yet it is possible to tweak that calculation in favour of adaptation. But doing so requires help from all sides. Globally, countries need to bump up adaptation as a priority. There is a positive feedback loop between adaptation and mitigation, and doing more of one makes it easier to do the other. </p><p> Pouring money into mitigation without paying commensurate heed to adaptation is like swimming with one arm. Shifting some public-sector resources towards adaptation, in the form of procurement contracts and concessionary capital, will help to catalyse private-sector participation. There also needs to be a worldwide effort to better model potential loss and damage. That data then needs to be applied through the right pricing of carbon and risk. Governments need to correctly impose a price on emissions, and insurers need to integrate climate-related risks into their policies, so that we are properly accounting for the cost of inaction.</p><p> Finally, it might be time to take a coordinated and integrated approach towards climate action that doesn't separate mitigation and adaptation. For instance, restoring mangroves can build carbon sinks while reducing coastal hazards. Identifying opportunities for such co-benefits can greatly improve the efficiency of capital. The cost of adaptation is inevitable. We can invest now to prevent damage, or pay for the losses later.

Some also expect Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is also the finance minister, to speak about infrastructure for adapting to climate change in the Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18). The cost and talent requirements for sustainability reporting are key concerns for companies. All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025. Large non-listed companies will also have to do so from FY2027. These disclosures include a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct, or Scope 1, emissions as well as their Scope 2 emissions, which arise indirectly from energy purchase and usage.Last year, Singapore unveiled the Sustainability Reporting Grant (SRG) to assist large companies with annual revenues of S$100 million and above. It will cover up to 30 per cent of qualifying costs for the preparation of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sustainability report, capped at S$150,000 per company.Mike Lim, a partner at venture capital firm Trirec, suggested that the SRG could be expanded to cover the cost of sustainability initiatives that are part of the reporting process, while also incorporating incentives for early adopters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting ahead of the mandatory timeline could receive additional incentives, such as tax breaks or higher grant amounts,\u00e2\u20ac said Lim, whose firm invests in clean energy and climate tech companies. </p><p>Kelvin Lim, managing director of property player LHN Group, said that more support is needed for the technical aspects of emissions reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the challenges we faced was gathering, compiling and computing the data required to translate into emissions data. More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\u00e2\u20ac he said. He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\u00e2\u20ac Chia said. The reporting of Scope 3 emissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which arise from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upstream and downstream value chains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date. We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\u00e2\u20ac said Ng. Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate. Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). From 2024, companies subject to Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.Carbon markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\u00e2\u20ac, said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\u00e2\u20ac he said. To spur the supply of carbon credits, start-up incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit. EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.While no announcements are expected on Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\u00e2\u20ac said Dr Rao.Targeted help for SMEsSeveral market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. While Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\u00e2\u20ac, said Helge Muenkel, DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief sustainability officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\u00e2\u20ac he said. Eric Lian, UOB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\u00e2\u20ac To accelerate SMEs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian.

Climate adaptationSome industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation.

Budget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\u00e2\u20ac he said.

More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\" he said. </p><p> He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.</p><p> Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. </p><p> \"The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\" Chia said. </p><p> The reporting of Scope 3 emissions -- which arise from a company's upstream and downstream value chains -- is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.</p><p> Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company's entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. </p><p> \"Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date.</p><p> \"We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\" said Ng. </p><p> Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. </p><p> Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate.</p><p> Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). </p><p> From 2024, companies subject to Singapore's carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.</p><p> Carbon markets \"need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\", said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. </p><p> \"While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\" he said. </p><p> To spur the supply of carbon credits, startup incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. </p><p> On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit.</p><p> EY's Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore's attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.</p><p> While no announcements are expected on Singapore's carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative.</p><p> \"This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\" said Dr Rao.</p><p> Several market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. </p><p> While Singapore's carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \"there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\", said Helge Muenkel, DBS' chief sustainability officer.</p><p> \"Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions, will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\" he said.</p><p> Eric Lian, UOB's head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \"SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\"</p><p> To accelerate SMEs' sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. </p><p> The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. </p><p> Some industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation.

An October 2024 article by Temasek Trust highlights a global funding gap in the trillions, estimating that between US$2.5 trillion ($3.24 trillion) and US$4 trillion in annual financing and investment are needed to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his welcome address at the fifth Philanthropy Asia Summit (PAS) on May 5, Lim Boon Heng, chairman of both the Philanthropy Asia Alliance (PAA) and Temasek Holdings, highlighted the shrinking pool of international aid, which is creating \"critical gaps\" in areas such as climate adaptation, food security and public health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the same event, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who participated in a PAS panel discussion with Gates Foundation chair and trustee Bill Gates, warned that this global retreat from aid is unlikely to reverse anytime soon. Tharman, who is also the patron of the PAA, notes that \"even with China stepping up, somewhat, there is a significant reduction in aid monies\".</p><p>In March, the Donald Trump administration cut over 80% of United States Agency for International Development (USAID) programmes, which are responsible for providing foreign aid in areas such as health, education and economic development. These programmes spent \"tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve\", said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a post on X in early March. Similarly, several European countries have reduced foreign aid to prioritise defence and domestic issues.</p><p>Given these funding cuts, the world must maximise the value of every dollar, whether from public, philanthropic or private sources. \"None of their own is going to be enough, but all three need a step up, not just in volumes, but in terms of effectiveness,\" says Tharman. This means countries have to be more self-sufficient, although many still require international support through multilateral development banks (MDBs), bilateral schemes and so on, he adds.</p><p>Making a difference</p><p>While building up domestic tax capacity and running budgets more effectively is an \"extremely important challenge\", it is not a hopeless case at all. \"Many people don't realise that in the lowest income parts of the world, several countries have significantly increased their tax collection, I'm talking about by two or three percentage points of GDP over the last decade,\" says Tharman. However, he acknowledges that there is a \"capacity issue\", in how countries can digitise tax systems, build up monitoring systems, enforcement systems and so on.</p><p>Gates, whose foundation has disbursed a \"little bit more\" than US$100 billion in the last 25 years, agrees that the world may go through a \"tough period\" with the funding cuts.</p><p>Even so, he believes the world is unlikely to return to the child mortality rates seen at the turn of the century, when 10 million children died before the age of five, due to innovative tools such as new vaccines that protect girls from HIV and treatments that prevent maternal deaths from childbirth-related bleeding.</p><p>Even relatively modest investments can have a profound impact. Just a few thousand dollars that go towards bed nets or medicine for neglected tropical diseases can save lives. Even a gift of US$1 million \"can make a huge difference,\" says Gates, who is also the co-founder of software firm Microsoft.</p><p>Beyond making a difference for an important moral cause, Tharman sees broader economic returns from giving as well. Citing Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, every dollar given eventually generates US$54 in return and, beyond that, broader economic returns like healthier and more productive lives for everyone.</p><p>This is the type of thinking that should motivate the global public sector as well as philanthropic giving, he adds. \"We're doing this not just out of the goodness of our hearts. We're doing this not just because it is an important moral cause, but because we are all better off living in a world where every country has populations that lead wealthier and productive lives. We are all safer and we are all better off.\"</p><p>Philanthropy's climate impact</p><p>Beyond public health, Asia remains severely underfunded in tackling climate change, says Ravi Menon, former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and current Ambassador for Climate Action. Menon also serves as senior adviser at the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS).</p><p>The region's annual funding gap for climate mitigation and adaptation exceeds US$800 billion, driven by factors such as insufficient public capital and a reluctance among private investors to commit.</p><p>The mismatch presents an opportunity for philanthropy to step up and play a larger role in driving climate action in Asia, Menon says. \"A partnership across public, private and philanthropic capital and philanthropic capital can help effectively fill the gaps in Asia's climate finance.\"</p><p>Less than 2% of philanthropic giving is directed towards preventing climate change, and of that, only around 12% reaches Asia, despite the region's outsized needs, Menon notes. Asia accounts for 50% of global emissions, and 90% of the world's future growth in energy demand will stem from the region, he adds.</p><p>Asia will also suffer the most from climate change, with over one billion people in South and Southeast Asia being affected by the extreme heat by 2080. Asia's climate-induced losses could also reach about 40% of the region's GDP by 2100.</p><p>Philanthropists may leverage funding instruments such as blended finance to maximise the impact of their contributions. \"The premise of blended finance is to use concessional capital to de-risk and crowd in multiples of commercial capital,\" says Menon, who notes that the concessional layer from both philanthropic and public capital accepts first loss and lower returns, which then catalyses \"significantly more\" private capital. \"Blended finance allows philanthropies to amplify the impact of their giving, because for every dollar they put in, they are crowding in multiples of private capital.\"</p><p>Measuring outcomes</p><p>Philanthropy is also evolving in how it's practised, with a new generation of leaders keen to see the impact of their contributions, says Tharman. While financial returns remain a consideration, these leaders are equally focused on the social impact they create, he adds. \"They want to see a broader economic impact in the lives of beneficiaries. So I think that thinking has shifted, and it's important now to develop the methods that allow us to measure impact.\"</p><p>The Tanoto Foundation, for example, takes an evidence-based approach, identifying the root causes of issues it aims to address and investing in long-term change, says Belinda Tanoto, managing director of the Royal Golden Eagle (RGE) group and trustee of the Tanoto Foundation. Belinda is the younger daughter of Indonesian businessman Sukanto Tanoto, founder and chairman of RGE.</p><p>Sukanto, along with his wife, Tinah Bingei Tanoto, established the Tanoto Foundation in 1981.</p><p>Formally launched in 2000, the foundation operates in Indonesia, Singapore, China and Brazil, countries that align with the family's business operations. Its focus areas include education, early childhood development and other key social initiatives. \"Our approach is different,\" says Belinda in an interview with The Edge Singapore on the sidelines of the PAS, when asked about the shift in thinking among the next generation of philanthropists.</p><p>This generation is more inclined to collaborate with partners, pool resources, bring together their networks and engage with governments, she adds. At PAS, one example is the Tanoto Foundation signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Gates Foundation to jointly advance health, nutrition and education across Asia.</p><p>Collective action</p><p>Recognising that philanthropic funds are limited, particularly in Indonesia, where they make up just 0.5% of the government's budget, compared to the global average of 0.5% of global GDP, Belinda emphasises that partnerships are essential for driving more meaningful change.</p><p>One such example is the foundation's focus on investing in children's early years and addressing stunting, a significant and complex issue in Indonesia, where no single funder can tackle it alone.</p><p>One funder may contribute expertise in innovative solutions, while the Tanoto Foundation, supported by a team of 150 in Indonesia, offers on-the-ground insight and strong relationships with local stakeholders, the government and funders, says Belinda.</p><p>Investing in the early years was a \"big project\", where the foundation worked with global funders and trained front-line workers, she recalls. That resulted in a huge success, reducing Indonesia's stunting rate from 31% in 2017 to 19.8% in 2024.</p><p>Another project which Belinda is \"very excited\" about is to support better frontline workers or human development workers, who are normally women, collecting data from the ground to ensure that each child gets the help they need.</p><p>When it comes to measuring success, Belinda sees it in terms of impact at the programme level. Reducing the stunting rate is one measure, while improving student learning outcomes is another. \"For us, given that our desire is also to build the philanthropy ecosystem in Asia, a big part of how we measure success is also whether there are others that are coming with us to do it because we really want to [have] the catalytic and multiplier effect,\" she adds.</p><p>While she acknowledges that it is often easier for the foundation to work independently, the organisation opts to collaborate with partners, recognising the importance of bringing other funders, whether global, regional or local, on the journey.</p><p>Belinda also sees that the changing global landscape will require philanthropists to not only step up, but also to work in a more efficient, targeted and productive manner.</p><p>To younger philanthropists, she urges them to \"just start doing\" the work, noting that things are constantly evolving. She adds: \"The amount of tools that are available to philanthropists now with digitalisation and AI and data, it's amazing. It really opens up a new possibility.\"</p><p>It also helps that governments and other organisations are now more attuned to philanthropic work. \"I still remember in 2009, if I talked to a government official, they thought I was between CSR (corporate social responsibility). It's very confusing, but now they understand what philanthropy is,\" says Belinda. \"The openness of the government to partner it's amazing.

And this election year, the cherry on top is special SG60 benefits. Something for everyone, in other words. </p><p> While all this may be justified, what is striking is the dearth of public discussion about how it should be paid for, both now and in the future. It is simply assumed that resources will always be readily available.</p><p> This assumption deserves a closer look, especially if we consider the needs over the medium term.</p><p> Take healthcare -- it has overtaken education to be the biggest component of social expenditure, which has almost doubled from fiscal year (FY) 2014 to FY2023. </p><p> In Budget 2024, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, who is now also Prime Minister, pointed out that the Ministry of Health's annual budget had tripled within the decade, adding that \"with a rapidly ageing population, the fiscal pressures of healthcare will only grow\".</p><p> There will be other spending needs. Mr Wong projected that with the expansion of social safety nets and other measures, the Government expects to spend about $40 billion on Forward Singapore initiatives alone by 2030. There will also have to be more spending on energy transition, climate adaptation and other big-ticket items.</p><p> So, by 2030, total spending will be around 20 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with 15 per cent in 2010, which is quite a jump. </p><p> If Singapore stays within this limit -- which is a big if -- Mr Wong indicated that it should have enough resources to balance its budget, helped by the latest increase in the goods and services tax (GST). \"But the medium-term fiscal position is tight,\" he said.</p><p> There is thus a case to explore how Singapore can expand its fiscal space, and the sooner the better. </p><p> To do this, Princeton University's professor of economics Atif Mian, who was recently in Singapore as MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) Term Professor at NUS, suggested that the Republic should consider some seemingly radical options.</p><p> The balanced budget rule should not be cast in stoneThe most important is to relax its balanced budget rule, under which the Government is required to balance its budget over a single term, which typically covers five years.</p><p> Prof Mian, who is an expert on the topic of debt, agreed that this rule, which was put in place in 1991, has served Singapore well. </p><p> It has enabled the Republic to build a reputation for fiscal prudence, thereby maintaining investor confidence and ensuring a strong credit rating. It has also forced the Government to prioritise spending and find efficient ways to deliver public services.</p><p> But this self-imposed constraint also has costs. One is the \"rich country problem\" that besets well-managed economies such as Singapore and Switzerland: There is high foreign demand for their assets and currencies, which can lead to upward pressure on their exchange rates. </p><p> So far, the MAS has managed this by selling Singapore dollars and accumulating foreign currencies, which are added to reserves, as well as gold.</p><p> But Prof Mian suggests that some of the pressure on the currency could be released if Singapore allows itself to run fiscal deficits and borrowing other than for only a few large infrastructure projects. </p><p> \"If the rest of the world is ultra-keen to hold Singapore dollar paper, one way to deal with it is to increase the supply of that paper by running deficits,\" he told me in an interview. </p><p> That way, Singapore could get extra money at low cost and use it productively without having to raise taxes or cut spending. It could even increase spending more than it would otherwise be able to do. </p><p> \"It would be like a free lunch for Singapore,\" Prof Mian said.</p><p> Safeguards could be put in place -- such as a limit on debt that is issued -- to ensure that fiscal prudence is maintained. </p><p> The median debt-to-GDP ratio in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is around 72 per cent, while its more fiscally prudent members such as Estonia and Luxembourg have debt-to-GDP ratios below 30 per cent. </p><p> If Singapore had a limit on debt of just 5 per cent of GDP -- which would be conservative by any standard -- that would yield inflows of $33.7 billion, based on 2023 GDP of $673.3 billion, more than enough to cover all of its current health spending. </p><p> The additional strategic investments Singapore would be able to make if it allowed limited fiscal deficits would also stimulate economic growth, which would help at least partially offset the deficits.</p><p> The balanced budget rule was the right policy for its time. But amid an ageing population, a de-globalising world, faster technological disruption and higher climate risks, Singapore's circumstances have changed. </p><p> \"Too much of a good thing can be bad,\" said Prof Mian, adding that relaxing the balanced budget rule \"sounds radical, but actually it is not\".</p><p> Raising property taxes  on foreign buyers Another suggestion relates to property taxes. Prof Mian proposed levying a differential (higher) tax rate on foreign buyers. A lot of foreign buying is concentrated in the top tier of the property market, comprising mainly properties in the core central region worth $5 million or more. </p><p> Analysis by List Sotheby's International Realty cited by its research director Han Huan Mei in The Business Times found that, in 2018, around 63 per cent of buyers of such properties were foreigners and permanent residents (PRs). </p><p> By the first three quarters of 2024, which was after the latest increase in additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) in 2023, this had dropped to 49 per cent -- still a substantial proportion. </p><p> Foreign buyers, even if concentrated in one segment of the market, can influence property prices. </p><p> As real estate broking company PropNex has pointed out, high foreign demand for luxury properties \"can create a ripple effect across the broader real estate market, where not only luxury homes, but also mid-tier properties, may experience a price hike due to the general uptick in property values\". </p><p> The Government has tried to dampen foreign purchases of property by sharply hiking ABSD for most foreigners (excluding a few nationalities) from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. </p><p> This has been partially successful, as evidenced by the continued (albeit fewer) foreign purchases of Singapore properties. </p><p> Prof Mian reckons that some foreign buyers may calculate that they can recoup at least part of the ABSD, which is a one-off payment, through price appreciation in subsequent years. </p><p> Some prices in the high-end segment of the market have indeed risen strongly. Urban Redevelopment Authority data on transactions shows, for example, that the median price per sq ft at Kim Lin Park, a landed development in Lengkok Merak, rose by more than 61 per cent from January 2021 to July 2024; prices at Mirage Tower in Kim Seng Road rose more than 31 per cent from April 2020 to January 2025; and those at Leonie Suites in Leonie Hill were up almost 29 per cent from January 2020 to October 2024.</p><p> A more potent deterrent to foreign buyers than ABSD would be higher property taxes on foreign owners. These would also yield more revenues, because they are paid on a recurrent basis, rather than being just one-off payments.</p><p> A case can be made that Singaporeans and PRs who live in high-end or landed properties be taxed at lower rates, as many of them are retirees who bought their units long ago and, as such, differ from more recent foreign buyers.</p><p> Lower the GST threshold A third option for raising revenue is to broaden the coverage of GST without raising the rate, even though it is less than half of the 19.3 per cent average rate in the OECD. </p><p> The threshold for GST registration for businesses in Singapore is an annual taxable turnover exceeding $1 million. This is abnormally high compared with other advanced economies. </p><p> For example, the threshold is GBP90,000 (about S$152,000) in Britain, A$75,000 (about S$63,000) in Australia, and NZ$60,000 (about S$46,000) in New Zealand.</p><p> Lowering the GST threshold for Singapore businesses would expand the tax base and yield higher revenues as well as promote fairer competition between smaller and larger companies, even among small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p> It is true that a lower GST threshold will impose more administrative and compliance costs on small companies. But there are measures that can mitigate this burden.</p><p> First, the GST threshold could be lowered in phases: for example, initially to $750,000, then to $500,000 three years later and so on, which would give companies time to prepare. </p><p> Second, there could be simplified GST filing for smaller companies -- for instance, through reduced frequency of reporting. </p><p> Third, one-time tax rebates and subsidies for accounting software could be provided for companies newly required to register for GST. </p><p> The end goal should be to significantly reduce the GST threshold over time from the current level, while exempting micro enterprises. The revenue gains would be substantial, and the rewards will outweigh the efforts.</p><p> The measures discussed above will no doubt face political pushback. </p><p> While they are not particularly radical, being widely practised by other well-managed economies -- even Switzerland runs fiscal deficits, for example -- they will be resisted as they depart from long-established norms. </p><p> Nevertheless, they should be considered as a means to create the extra fiscal space that Singapore will need, given its rising pressures on expenditure and the more challenging external environment.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Besides government pledges, if you comb through the wish lists put out by economists, consulting firms and the public, you will find a laundry list of items and schemes that need more funding: For the population, there are demands for higher spending on healthcare and eldercare, education, community facilities, cost-of-living payouts including more CDC vouchers, wider social safety nets, baby bonuses and paid parental leave, to cite just a few.

If Singapore stays within this limit -- which is a big if -- Mr Wong indicated that it should have enough resources to balance its budget, helped by the latest increase in the goods and services tax (GST)."]}, {"relevance_score": 74, "title": "Singapore: Launch of NTU Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health - Dr Amy Khor", "published": "2025-04-15", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* The NTU Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health is launched to address the growing impact of climate change on human health, with the World Health Organisation estimating that climate change will lead to increased disease prevalence and destruction of health infrastructure by 2030, costing US$2 - 4 billion per year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Climate change is intensifying, causing a cascade of interconnected climate impacts that amplify extreme weather events, leading to heat stress, vector-borne diseases, water resource management issues, and air pollution in Singapore and the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* The NTU Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health will play a crucial role in addressing climate change and its impacts on human health, with a focus on research, innovation, and adaptation efforts to protect public health in Singapore.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>April 15 -- Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore issued the following speech by SMS Amy Khor:</p><p>Speech by SMS Amy Khor at the launch of the NTU Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health on 15 April 2025.</p><p>1. Good afternoon. It is indeed my pleasure to join you at the launch of the new Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health.</p><p>Climate change and health</p><p>2. The establishment of this research centre is indeed timely, given the growing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events as suggested by the three speakers earlier, and their resulting health impacts. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), climate change poses an urgent threat to the global population as it can lead to increased disease prevalence and destruction of health infrastructure that could potentially overwhelm health systems. The WHO estimates that by 2030, the direct costs of damage to our health systems as a result of climate change will reach US$2 - 4 billion per year. As climate change intensifies, its impact on environmental and human health will become increasingly severe.</p><p>3. Rising global temperatures caused by climate change have triggered a cascade of interconnected climate impacts that amplifies the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Regionally, occurrences of heat stress are becoming more severe and frequent. Record rainfall and flash floods are also happening with higher incidence in Singapore and our region during the monsoon seasons.</p><p>4. These erratic weather conditions can potentially foster the spread of vector-borne diseases, affect the management of water resources, increase the likelihood of heat stress, and worsen air pollution.</p><p>5. Heat stress, in particular, poses a growing threat to human health. Studies show that on average approximately 489,000 heat-related deaths occur each year over the past two decades. An estimated 45% of these in are Asia.</p><p>6. Air pollution is another health hazard which can be worsened by climate change. Higher temperatures contribute to forest and peatland fires, exacerbating haze and air quality issues.</p><p>7. As a highly urbanised and densely populated city-state, Singapore is exceptionally vulnerable to climate impacts on our environment and public health. For example, rising temperatures coupled with the urban heat island effect would lead to the effects of heat being more likely felt by our people here. Unlike people in larger countries, Singaporeans would not be able to seek respite from the heat in another part of the country with a different climate zone. This is precisely why our climate adaptation efforts, particularly those protecting public health, must be robust and effective.</p><p>8. Human and environmental health issues have in recent years come to the forefront of global climate discussions. In 2023, countries collectively agreed to the COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health, to reflect our common position on the importance of health within the climate discourse and the COP process. COP28 elevated the health agenda with the introduction of a Health Day, to mainstream health considerations within the global climate agenda. WHO subsequently released a COP29 Special Report on Climate and Health last year.</p><p>9. What do all these mean for Singapore? While Singapore may be small and resource-scarce, we have always turned our vulnerability into strength. Our nation-building experience has shown us how we can, with boldness, tenacity, and vision, shape our lived environment and rise above our constraints.</p><p>10. Many of you would be familiar with NEWater. Its genesis dates back to the 1970s, when the Government commissioned a study to determine the feasibility of producing reclaimed water to address our limited water sources. Through years of extensive research and innovation, we successfully developed high-grade reclaimed water that is safe for drinking. Today, it stands as a sustainable water source and forms part of our Four National Taps. From a daring dream in the 1970s to a cornerstone of our nation's water security today, our NEWater journey showcases our nation's innovation and resilience. Similarly, we can overcome today's challenges arising from climate change with the same boldness, tenacity, and vision demonstrated by our forefathers.</p><p>Importance of research and innovation in safeguarding human and environmental health</p><p>11. Research and innovation will help us achieve our net zero ambition and strengthen our resilience against climate change. We will continue to build on RIE 2025, which supports basic research and promotes innovation in the areas of climate change and human health.</p><p>12. Research will open up pathways for us to testbed and develop measures to safeguard human and environmental health. One successful example is Project Wolbachia. Vector-borne diseases such as dengue are endemic to Southeast Asia, and higher temperatures can create favourable conditions for mosquitoes to breed and viruses to multiply faster. Project Wolbachia, which was the outcome of scientific research, has helped us avoid major dengue surges in 2023 and 2024. Results from a field study indicate that residents living in Project Wolbachia sites are about 75 per cent less likely to be infected with dengue. By the end of 2026, 800,000 households or about 50% of all households in Singapore, will benefit from Project Wolbachia.</p><p>13. Another research project by NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine uses computer simulations to show how climate change will impact health risks from mosquito-borne diseases. The simulations also examine the economic impact of such diseases and the impact on productivity due to rising absenteeism. Such projects allow us to develop a better understanding of the evolving impacts of climate change on human health.</p><p>NTU's mark in sustainability science and research</p><p>14. It is indeed encouraging to see NTU's network of research entities enhance local knowledge and capability-building for climate science and environmental sustainability. This includes the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), Nanyang Environment Water and Research Institute (NEWRI), Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Science Engineering (SCELSE), and Energy Research Institute (ERI).</p><p>Launch of Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health</p><p>15. The new Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health (CCEH) is an important addition to this network. CCEH's research will span three domains - air quality, extreme heat, and water supply and quality - with a focus on the tropics. This will build on findings from Singapore's 3rd National Climate Change Study (V3) released last year, to advance our understanding of tropical climate variability and its potential impact on Singapore and the larger Southeast Asia region.</p><p>16. In bringing together the interdisciplinary expertise of existing research entities within the NTU ecosystem and a consortium of experts from global Institutes of Higher Learning, CCEH is well-positioned to further catalyse the design of evidence-based strategies and inform policy-making.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>As we launch CCEH today, we are not just opening another new research facility or adding to the litany of acronyms. We are advancing new knowledge and capabilities in environmental and public health for Singapore and the wider Southeast Asian region. These possibilities could pave the way for us to better build a more climate-resilient society, while aligning our efforts with the United Nation's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, or Agenda. So let me congratulate you on the launch of CCEH, and have a very good afternoon. Thank you very much.</p><p>[Category: Health Care Services and Facilities, Healthcare, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["For example, rising temperatures coupled with the urban heat island effect would lead to the effects of heat being more likely felt by our people here.

One potential area is food cooperation, as Vietnam is a major agricultural producer while Singapore imports significantly. A stronger relationship on this front would be a win-win project, he said. The second example was the VSIPs, of which there are now 20 across Vietnam. </p><p> \"But we think there is scope to do more, upgrade the VSIPs, and then maybe even consider projects in third countries,\" said PM Wong.</p><p> Earlier in the day, at a virtual ground-breaking event for the new VSIP in Thai Binh province that was announced last year, PM Wong said that VSIPs \"set the benchmark for industrial park development in Vietnam\" from the beginning.</p><p> The next phase of VSIP development would take reference from the CSP.</p><p> First, VSIPs will be smarter, using technology to improve energy, water, waste and traffic management for greater efficiency and cost savings. One key enabler is a previously signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) on developing technology-enabled industrial parks. Second, VSIPs will be greener, with more of them powered by renewable energy.</p><p> Finally, the industrial parks will be more connected. The 20 VSIPs \"can be mutually supporting and have a synergistic effect\", with good connectivity being key to this, said PM Wong.</p><p> For example, a highway is being built to link Thai Binh province to Lach Huyen Port. VSIP Thai Binh can thus \"serve as a satellite industrial park, supporting existing large manufacturers in other surrounding VSIPs, while attracting investments in high-tech and advanced manufacturing industries\", he said.</p><p> Extending beyond VietnamIn his wrap-up interview, PM Wong noted that Singapore has industrial park projects with other countries, including China, India and Indonesia. There are learning points from each experience, he said.</p><p> A key consideration is whether the local government is able to provide a conducive environment, stability and predictability, allowing the country to attract investments -- factors which Singapore cannot control.</p><p> \"Vietnam is one country which has made tremendous efforts since the start of its reform process to open up, to attract investments, and it is continuing to do so with great determination,\" he said.</p><p> It is also the first Asean member state with which Singapore has a CSP, reflecting the \"comprehensive and strategic nature\" of the relationship, which includes strong connectivity initiatives and economic cooperation. \"If we can do this (with) more Asean countries, so much the better,\" said PM Wong. \"But each relationship will evolve at its own pace.\"</p><p> Strengthening bilateral ties will also benefit Asean as a whole, through networks of interactions and partnerships, he added. </p><p> With a \"profound change in the global order... it feels like we are entering a world where it's every country for itself\", the prime minister said. He noted that Asean countries, individually, will feel that this is a \"very difficult, inhospitable global environment\". But collectively, Asean is much stronger and can hold its own.</p><p> At a ceremony earlier on Wednesday, Singapore and Vietnam exchanged five agreements on cooperation in various areas.</p><p> These included a letter of intent for enhanced cooperation in cross-border electricity trade for the Asean Power Grid.</p><p> The countries will explore increasing the targeted capacity of low-carbon electricity imports from Vietnam to Singapore to around two gigawatts (GW) by 2035. This builds on conditional approval that Sembcorp Utilities received in October 2023 to import 1.2 GW of low-carbon electricity from Vietnam, via new subsea cables spanning around 1,000 km.</p><p> Three MOUs were signed for cooperation on digital development and innovation, cross-border QR payments, and people-to-people ties.</p><p>Singapore and Vietnam plan to promote collaboration on digital infrastructure development, as well as facilitate knowledge exchanges in digital transformation across industries, smart cities and digital government.</p><p> They also seek to enhance exchanges on interoperable digital systems, frameworks and platforms for digital trade and logistics solutions, and strengthen cooperation in artificial intelligence.</p><p> The two countries will also promote information exchange and facilitate partnerships in areas such as climate adaptation, youth engagement and development needs.</p><p> Before the ground-breaking for VSIP Thai Binh, MOUs were also signed between joint venture partners Sembcorp Development and Becamex IDC -- which execute VSIPs -- and Vietnam's local governments.</p><p> These agreements pertain to exploring initial and expansion VSIP projects in the southern Binh Duong province, as well as Haiphong city and Hai Duong and Hung Yen provinces in the north.</p><p> Industrial land at VSIP Thai Binh will be available for handover to customers in 2026, Sembcorp and Becamex also said in a joint statement.</p><p> Future collaboration on carbonBeyond the VSIPs, the leaders of both countries agreed that there is scope to pursue sustainable and resilient growth together, said PM Wong. This includes importing low-carbon energy into Singapore and carbon credit collaboration, with an implementation agreement for the latter being discussed.</p><p> \"Through these projects, we can also pave the way for wider initiatives like the Asean Power Grid, which will improve the collective energy resilience of our region,\" he said.</p><p> In addition to a meeting with Chinh on Wednesday morning, PM Wong also met National Assembly of Vietnam Chairman Tran Thanh Man, as well as called on President Luong Cuong and To Lam. He returned to Singapore in the evening.</p><p> The day's events followed a dinner hosted by Chinh on Tuesday, where the two leaders toasted to the enduring relationship between Singapore and Vietnam, and expressed expectations for deeper cooperation.</p><p> Before the trip -- the sixth of PM Wong's introductory visits to South-east Asian nations since he was sworn into office last May -- the prime ministers had met on the sidelines of the Asean Summit in Laos, as well as the Group of 20 Summit in Brazil.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Singapore and Vietnam plan to promote collaboration on digital infrastructure development, as well as facilitate knowledge exchanges in digital transformation across industries, smart cities and digital government.

And the spike that we see in (energy) growth demand is going to help build out and make that next phase happen, possibly accelerate.\"</p><p> The addition of renewable energy capacity across the globe over the last few years has not been met with similar upgrades to countries' national power grids. </p><p> Legacy grid and transmission systems were originally set up to handle the stable flow of energy from centralised fossil fuel power plants. As more renewable energy came online, problems relating to grid instability and unreliability have also emerged, given that solar and wind are intermittent sources of power. </p><p> The need to invest in power grids that can accommodate renewable power is one example of a structural shift towards a climate-adjusted future that long-term investors like GIC need to take note of.  </p><p> While markets have been seized with volatility and uncertainty with regard to sustainable investing in light of the rolling back of several climate policies in the United States under President Donald Trump, Chew said that GIC needs to maintain its focus on fundamental asset values in its long-term asset allocation strategy. \"Investors are reacting to noise and headlines... However, long-term investors cannot afford to put aside the systemic impact of climate change in favour of the noise,\" she noted. </p><p> Based on GIC's analysis on various scenarios, climate change has been found to be a drag on returns and is deflationary on asset prices. </p><p> Even though renewable energy investment has not yet proven to be reliable in generating returns for investors, Chew explained that there were several long-term structural trends that represent tailwinds for the sector. </p><p> Besides grid development, growing energy demand, advancements in energy efficiency as well as the increasing commerciality of energy storage solutions such as batteries and liquid storage fuels were other important shifts to take into account. </p><p> While the role of fossil fuels is likely to increase under the Trump administration, Chew said that it may still not be enough to meet the increase in demand for energy, which means that the build-up of renewable energy generation capacity will continue to accelerate. </p><p> \"We're living in a world of not either this energy or that energy, but more and more energy. We're living in a reality of energy addition. And so, even though there's a purported pivot in the US back to traditional energy, there will be more than sufficient demand to keep renewable energy technologies well deployed and growing throughout this period,\" she added. </p><p> Furthermore, outside of the US, policy momentum on decarbonisation remains strong in the medium term in other markets, including the European Union, China, Australia and the United Kingdom. </p><p> GIC's long-term view on how the energy transition would progress is that countries which shift towards more sustainable and affordable sources of energy will enjoy more advantages, while those that lock in on \"dirtier\" and more expensive energy supply sources will be disadvantaged. </p><p> Against the backdrop of potentially escalating tariffs between major economic powers, Chew also pointed out that this may result in closer trade ties between China -- which is the world's largest manufacturer of various clean energy technologies -- and developing countries looking to build their green energy supply chains. </p><p> Taking into account all these developments, GIC has a \"stronger conviction\" that the world is moving towards a scenario where global warming reaches between 2 and 3 deg Celsius. It noted about two years ago that this scenario was \"marginally predominant\". </p><p> This means the world would have failed to reach the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to well below 2 deg C, with an aim of 1.5 deg C. </p><p> Known as the \"too little, too late\" scenario, it is one out of four climate scenarios that the investor has come up with to analyse how potential future climate conditions might impact their investments and help them build portfolios more resilient to climate-related risks.

This proactive approach comes in response to the severe economic and human costs of recent climate-related disasters. In July alone, extreme weather \u2014 primarily heavy rains and floods \u2014 caused 76.85 billion RMB (US$10.1 billion) in economic losses, affecting over 26.4 million people, displacing 1.1 million and damaging thousands of homes.</p><p>                        These staggering impacts highlight China\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, with rising coastal flooding, urban waterlogging, droughts and heavy rainfall intensifying climate risks nationwide. Notably, recent extremes \u2014 including the highest national temperature on record and Beijing receiving 60% of its annual rainfall in just 83 hours \u2014 demonstrate the growing threat. The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p>                        Projections paint an even more alarming picture. By the end of the century, heatwaves could triple, and water scarcity could worsen, deepening regional disparities. Economic losses are expected to soar, with a 1.5\u00b0C global temperature increase potentially leading to US$112 billion in direct flooding-related losses \u2014 four times the level seen between 2006-2018. Coastal cities like Shanghai face additional risks from extreme high tides.

This approach is influenced by Mao Zedong\u2019s belief that \u201cman must conquer nature\u201d, and has led to a focus on climate resilience and infrastructure in national policies, driven by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts.</p><p>                        Managing extreme weather has long been tied to political legitimacy in China. Historically, failures in this area \u2014 particularly flooding \u2014 have been seen as signs of a loss of authority, linked to the ancient concept of the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d. This practice dates back more than 4,000 years, to Yu the Great of the Xia dynasty, who is said to have tamed the Yellow River.</p><p>                        \u2018Sponge city\u2019: mismanagement impacting effectiveness</p><p>                        Challenges lie ahead. One of the biggest concerns being the potentially high costs of climate adaptation projects. The \u201csponge city\u201d concept (\u6d77\u7ef5\u57ce\u5e02), introduced in 2015 in Chinese cities to manage stormwater through permeable surfaces and green infrastructure, exemplifies these challenges. </p><p>                        Although the central government initially allocated 400-600 million RMB per city involved in the 16-city pilot infrastructure-driven programme, total spending on sponge city projects by 2017 had surpassed US$12 billion, with Beijing covering only 15-20% of the costs. The remainder is shouldered by local governments and the private sector.\u00a0</p><p>                        ... many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. \u2014 Professor Kongjian Yu, Dean, College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University</p><p>                        Despite over 1 trillion RMB (US$140 billion) being invested by cities between 2016-2020, these projects have struggled to cope with severe flooding, highlighting concerns about their effectiveness. Notably, in 2021, \u201chistorically rare\u201d rainfall led to devastating floods in Zhengzhou, affecting over 14 million people, causing 398 deaths and 53.2 billion RMB (US$8 billion) in economic losses. </p><p>                        However, some critics have argued that the sponge city design, intended to handle one-in-30-year rainfall, proved inadequate in the face of such extremes. Media reports at the time suggested that sponge city infrastructure can handle a maximum of 200 millimetres (mm) of rain per day. </p><p>                        A view of Zhengzhou in Henan province, 12 December 2024.</p><p>                        In contrast, Zhengzhou saw rainfall in excess of 200 mm in just one hour. Others note that mismanagement by local officials, who ignored early flood warnings, exacerbated the crisis. </p><p>                        Professor Kongjian Yu, dean of the College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University, and a champion of the sponge city concept, said in a recent interview that the fact that cities are flooding shows that they are not creating enough sponge-like infrastructure. From his perspective, many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. </p><p>                        Further complicating the situation, local governments already burdened by debt may struggle to prioritise such expensive and long-term climate adaptation projects. In the face of a national economic slowdown, many localities are resorting to asset liquidation to address immediate revenue shortfalls in a process described as \u201csmashing iron pots and selling the steel\u201d. This short-term focus risks undermining long-term climate resilience, as local authorities may prioritise quick fixes over necessary investments in sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>                        Disconnect between Beijing and local governments and among regions</p><p>                        As the central government pushes forward with projects aimed at mitigating climate impacts, the widening gap between high-level planning and on-the-ground implementation becomes increasingly apparent, raising concerns about the sustainability and effectiveness of these efforts in addressing climate resilience in cities. Without a unified approach, the effectiveness of China\u2019s climate adaptation efforts will remain in question.</p><p>                        ...

Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        The consequences of this were seen notably, in the aftermath of the 2023 Beijing floods.

That experience sparked emotions which I've come to understand as \"eco-anxiety\" -- a deep sense of distress at the environmental devastation we are witnessing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This eventually let me to start WorkWell Leaders, a leadership-focused charity advocating for well-being and sustainable growth in the workplace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I was able to channel my anxiety into action, but many might not be so lucky. Studies show that eco-anxiety is rising, particularly among young people. Social media amplifies this distress, making it feel as if the future is already beyond repair. Those with eco-anxiety often experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and stress, and report lower overall mental well-being. The stress of knowing what is happening to our planet can breed powerlessness and even apathy.</p><p> A young woman I know had to quit her job due to eco-anxiety, coupled with the guilt of complicity in \"greenwashing\" -- conveying a false impression that a company's products are environmentally sound -- at one of the top employers in Singapore. \"I was feeling more and more depressed, and dreaded going to work every day,\" she said. </p><p> She is not alone. More than a few young working adults have reached out to me in recent times to share how conflicted and in despair they felt working for companies that simply did not care about the climate crisis. This inevitably leads to presenteeism -- physically present but mentally absent -- and quiet quitting.  </p><p> Yet, the dual crises of mental health and climate change have long been viewed as separate challenges. As we gain a deeper understanding, it becomes clear that they are intricately interconnected. Mental health, once sidelined, is now receiving the attention it deserves. Similarly, climate change is not just an environmental issue but a public health and humanitarian emergency.</p><p> As both of these crises intensify, we must approach them not as isolated issues, but as two sides of the same coin. Initiatives including the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy and the Green Plan 2030 are a step in the right direction as mental well-being is being introduced in climate resilience discussions, and vice versa, but Singapore must do more in this nexus of climate change and mental health.</p><p> Integrating mental health, climate approaches We cannot build resilient societies without addressing the trauma and displacement caused by climate change, nor can we create a healthy environment without a mentally healthy population. </p><p> As such, we must deal with the two biggest crises of our time in concert, not in silos. </p><p> However, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change for the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) under the Prime Minister's Office does not include the Ministry of Health, which leads the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy launched in 2024 to tackle mental health, now recognised as a significant health and social issue. </p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health Office (NMHO) -- to be fully established in 2025 -- is co-led by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social and Family Development, and comprises officers from the ministries of Education and Manpower -- but notably without any representation from the environment and sustainability agencies. </p><p> What are we missing here? With mental health a national priority and climate change an existential threat, the absence of integration in these national organisations creates a critical gap. </p><p>Singapore may not have to contend with the severe psychological impact of frequent natural disasters and climate-related migration that other countries are dealing with. However, rising temperatures and its mental health impact -- such as heat stress, especially for rental flat households and essential workers -- must be urgently considered. Some studies have found that a rise in temperature is associated with aggressive behaviour and suicidality. </p><p> The rise of eco-anxiety, particularly among Singapore's youth, also highlights the urgency of this cross collaboration and representation in NCCS and NMHO. A group of young people I spoke with at a university questioned whether it would be even responsible of them to bring children into a world grappling with climate change, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity. Such significant attitudinal changes could have far-reaching implications for Singapore's policies, particularly in areas such as public health, social development and economic sustainability. </p><p> It is also important to note that climate change doesn't just affect mental health -- it can also be worsened by poor mental health. When people are struggling with their mental health, they may feel overwhelmed, helpless or disconnected, making it more difficult for them to engage in proactive measures to address climate issues.</p><p> By ensuring that climate policies include mental health considerations, and vice versa, we can better support vulnerable populations and equip individuals with the resilience, motivation, and hope to confront climate challenges. </p><p> As well, the intersection of climate change and mental health presents new opportunities for research, policy and practice. This could include integrating mental health support into climate adaptation plans, extending climate finance to mental health services, and fostering community-led initiatives and creative approaches to address climate-induced stress. </p><p> How to survive and thrive'Mental health has worsened in Singapore since 2020, according to the Ministry of Health's National Population Health survey. Singaporeans have identified mental health as the biggest health problem, surpassing concerns about cancer and diabetes. Worryingly, one in three between the ages of 15 and 35 experiences severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress.</p><p> Experts found that youth mental well-being depends on connections in their social and environmental contexts. It's no wonder these same experts warn that the price of climate inaction will be the mental health of young people. </p><p> We must build environments where individuals can thrive, not just survive. Healing happens in ecosystems of care -- not in isolation. Such an ecosystem ranges from workplaces that prioritise psychological safety to schools that nurture emotional intelligence, to policies that embed mental health into broader social systems.</p><p> In this way, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy was a significant step towards addressing the crisis here, moving beyond crisis intervention to a full spectrum of care: prevention, early intervention, resilience-building, and community-based well-being.</p><p> The link between community well-being and nature is especially crucial in urban settings like Singapore, where green spaces play a vital role in fostering mental health and social cohesion. Shared experiences in nature can strengthen social bonds and foster a sense of community. As climate change threatens the environment, these natural spaces are at risk. When nature is degraded, not only is the physical environment compromised, but the mental and emotional resilience of the community is also weakened. </p><p> While working towards creating thriving individuals and communities, we must also focus on ensuring a thriving planet. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for over 50 per cent of the world's heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> In Singapore, we are experiencing rising sea levels, extreme heat and climate-related health risks. A deteriorating natural environment undermines efforts to foster mental and emotional resilience. So protecting our ecosystems is not just about preserving biodiversity, but safeguarding the mental health of our future generations. </p><p> Reasons for hopeI was delighted when the Singapore Green Plan 2030 launched in 2021 included the creation of spaces that promote mental well-being, reduce stress and enhance resilience.</p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy includes nature-based solutions, such as creating 30 therapeutic gardens across Singapore by 2030. These spaces will provide restorative environments for people with conditions like ADHD and dementia. </p><p> Furthermore, building codes now prioritise occupant well-being, with the Green Mark certification scheme and the Building Control Act playing key roles in promoting healthy, sustainable buildings.</p><p> And more recently, the Mercury Taskforce, comprising 37 public agencies led by the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment and National Environment Agency, announced the first National Heatwave Response Plan for Singapore. </p><p> The intersection of mental health and sustainability within environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks is increasingly critical for businesses. Investors are placing greater emphasis on companies that prioritise not only environmental sustainability but also the well-being of their employees and communities. </p><p> Healing from eco-anxietyThe way we treat our planet mirrors the way we treat ourselves. A world that exhausts its natural resources is the same world that exhausts its people. The burnout we feel individually is a reflection of the unsustainable systems we have created. If we want to heal the planet, we must also heal ourselves.</p><p> For me, healing has always come from nature. As a child, trees were my refuge from bullying. Thirty years later, amid a series of personal crises including a broken marriage, shattered career and financial ruin, I found myself hugging a tree again. And since then, I have hugged a tree every week after my regular run. </p><p> There's no single way forward, but there is hope in both individual and collective action. By building bridges between mental health professionals, environmentalists, policymakers, researchers and business and community leaders, we can create a future that is both sustainable and resilient for people and planet.</p><p> Anthea Ong is a former Nominated Member of Parliament, social entrepreneur, mental health advocate and author.

Ultimately, the fate of the glaciers is tied to our progress with global water security and climate change. Coordinated and collaborative international action that builds on a firm understanding of these interconnected issues and equally prioritises the water crisis is the only way toward glacier preservation. </p><p> Symbiotic relationship between water and climate changeTo fully understand the water crisis, we must first recognise its deep interconnection with the climate, where global temperature shifts disrupt water cycles around the world, and vice versa. Glacier melts, for instance, starkly illustrate this link. Their rapid retreat due to rising temperatures depletes critical freshwater reserves, significantly impacting communities that rely on them for agriculture and drinking water. </p><p> Excess meltwater also fuels rising sea levels, endangering coastal communities and intensifying extreme weather events like droughts and floods. </p><p> South-east Asia is expected to be particularly affected by such disasters, given that about 450 million people in the region live in low-elevation coastal zones. Rising sea levels would adversely impact Singapore, where 30 per cent of the island is less than five metres above the mean sea level. </p><p> Conversely, inefficient or poor water management practices worsen the climate crisis, especially given the increasingly energy-intensive nature of processes like the extraction, purification, and desalination of water. Without a shift toward sustainable water management that recognises the role and impact of water in shaping climate progress, we risk intensifying the very crisis we are trying to solve. </p><p> Dangers of employing a short-sighted approach to the water crisisThough the global water crisis demands a unified, collaborative response, it is still treated as a series of isolated, local issues. </p><p> Unlike carbon emissions, which impact a shared atmosphere, water crises manifest within specific regions, shaped by local geographies and climates, making them seem disconnected. This has led to a fragmented approach, where water challenges are addressed in silos rather than as part of an interconnected global system.</p><p> This narrow perspective overlooks a critical truth: the global water cycle is deeply influenced by international factors. Glacier melt in the Himalayas doesn't just affect nearby communities -- it disrupts weather patterns, water supplies, and ecosystems thousands of miles away. Similarly, unsustainable water management in one region can exacerbate climate-driven disasters elsewhere, creating a ripple effect across borders.</p><p> Viewing water crises as localised problems is not just shortsighted, but also counterproductive. It prevents the development of a unified global framework capable of driving collective action. Without such a framework, efforts to scale innovative solutions, such as circular water systems or advanced desalination technologies, remain scattered and inefficient, limiting their potential to address both water scarcity and climate-driven threats like glacier melt. Recognising water as a shared global concern is the first step toward meaningful, collective action.</p><p> Learning from climate policies to drive water actionEffective climate action has shown that no single policy -- whether regulation, subsidy, or market mechanism -- can drive systemic change alone. The most successful strategies, as highlighted by the Potsdam Institute and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, combine complementary policies to accelerate impact.</p><p> Yet, while global climate governance has advanced through global frameworks like the Paris Agreement, water policy remains largely fragmented and managed at the nation-level, lacking the same level of coordination and urgency. The water sector has an opportunity to learn from climate policy successes by fostering cross-sector collaboration, multi-level governance, and inclusive policy design. </p><p> Just as climate policies have integrated energy, transport, and industry to reduce emissions, water policies could align efforts across agriculture, urban planning, and ecosystem conservation to drive meaningful impact. Additionally, ensuring that water policies are seen as fair and equitable, particularly in regions with competing water demands, will be critical for securing public and political support. </p><p> Making the business case for waterDespite its clear economic and risk implications, the business case for water remains under-communicated. A CDP study found that financial institutions face potential water-related losses of up to US$301 billion, yet only a third of them have concrete mitigation strategies.</p><p> Stronger and more consistent communication from water experts in academic and business communities is needed to emphasise the importance of risk avoidance. Beyond risk mitigation, there needs to be compelling evidence of the social and economic value that can be unlocked through improved water management practices. </p><p> A shift in mindset is essential. Water must be recognised as a strategic asset that drives long-term resilience and profitability.</p><p> Collaboration : the key to scaling impactThe last but most vital piece of the water crisis puzzle is collaboration. Water challenges transcend borders, impacting ecosystems, economies, and communities worldwide. To drive meaningful progress, we must share solutions, resources, and expertise across industries, sectors, and geographies.</p><p> C40 Cities is a strong example of how collaboration can scale impact. By providing a platform for city leaders, experts, and businesses to exchange best practices, it accelerates solutions across key areas, including water resilience, climate adaptation, and sustainable urban planning. The Water Resilience Coalition is another example, uniting global companies and CEOs to prioritise water stress and its connection to climate change to the top of global corporate agenda.</p><p> Collaboration is also effective on a national level, as illustrated by the water agreement between Singapore and Malaysia. </p><p> In return for its reliance on imported water from Malaysia, Singapore has developed cutting-edge water technologies that can improve water management practices in Johor -- a partnership that holistically addresses the region's water challenges. </p><p> The urgency of the climate and water crises cannot be overstated. </p><p> Just a mere decade following the signing of the Paris Agreement, studies are showing that we may have already broken our promise to ideally cap the global average temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius. If we continue on this trajectory, the accelerated melting of glaciers will not just be an environmental warning but a tipping point for global water security.</p><p> The era for fragmented solutions is over.

A life-saving treatment left unpublished, a solution to climate change ignored, a revolutionary idea buried in bureaucracy. This isn't a hypothetical scenario, it's the reality we find ourselves in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Peer review was initially designed to hold research to a certain standard of integrity. Unfortunately, this has become a bottleneck, leading to the delay or even prevention of vital discoveries. It is clear that funding structures have been molded to prioritize research that can be patented and, more importantly, monetized. This has left crucial but \"non-commercial innovations\" without support. Instead of accelerating progress, these systems create barriers where only research with clear commercial potential moves forward, while ideas that could change the world never make it past the starting line.</p><p>Peer Review Is Essential, But It Needs Reform</p><p>Some will argue that peer review is the best way to maintain scientific quality, which I agree with. My question to you is what happens when it fails at its own purpose?</p><p>A<url normalizedValue=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1420798/\">study</url> published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine found that peer reviewers frequently miss major errors in research papers, even when those errors are intentionally inserted as a test. If peer review is failing to catch mistakes, is it really the gold standard we assume it to be?</p><p>Thanks to PNAS's<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/about/article-journal-metrics\">transparency</url>, we can see that the average time from content submission to publication is around 6.6 months, peer review alone takes approximately 47 days. In fast-moving, ever evolving fields like medicine or technology, there is no room for delay of information, it can be the difference between a solution being implemented or remaining buried.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed just how many holes there are in this system. When faced with an urgent crisis, scientists abandoned traditional publishing standards and instead used preprint servers to share findings instantly. If science could move that fast in an emergency, why should we accept a system that slows it down under normal circumstances?</p><p>Then there's the overwhelming issue of who gets published in the first place. It is believed that major journals historically have favored research from top universities, while independent researchers and smaller institutions fight to get their work past the initial review stage.<url normalizedValue=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02188?\">Studies</url> have indicated a perception that papers from lesser-known institutions are judged more harshly. Instead of being an objective filter for scientific merit, peer review too often reinforces academic hierarchies.</p><p>A transparent and fair peer review process would ensure that all research is evaluated based on its quality, not its source. Open peer review models, where reviewer comments are published alongside research, have already been shown to improve fairness and accountability. Faster review processes, combined with broader acceptance of preprint servers, could prevent unnecessary delays. Science moves forward when ideas are tested, challenged, and refined. A broken system only holds that process back.</p><p>Who Controls What Science Gets Done?</p><p>If peer review determines what gets published, funding determines what gets researched in the first place, and this is just as concerning. A 2024<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2024.2324913\">article</url> in Accountability in Research found that research into non-commercial treatments receives far less funding than research into newly developed, patentable drugs. This creates a system where financial incentives outweigh public health outcomes.</p><p>This bias extends beyond medicine, with studies on climate adaptation, soil regeneration, and ecological preservation struggling for funding because they don't provide immediate financial returns. The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-science-technology-and-innovation-outlook-2023_0b55736e-en.html\">OECD</url> further validates that short-term financial incentives have led to an undeniable focus on applied research at the expense of long-term discoveries that could benefit humanity.</p><p>In 2021, UNESCO released a<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unesco.org/reports/science/2021/en\">report</url> explaining that even when vital research is funded and published, access remains a major barrier. The vast majority of scientific studies are locked behind paywalls, meaning they are only for the select few. In fact, 50% of published research is not freely available.</p><p>We have created a contradiction \u2013 research is often funded by public money, conducted in public institutions, and reviewed by unpaid academics, yet the final product is controlled by private publishers who charge exorbitant fees for access. This doesn't sound right to me.</p><p>Governments and independent research bodies need to shift funding priorities and ensure that non-commercial research receives the same level of support as profit-driven projects. A research model that deprioritizes short-term profit would allow for investment in solutions that have long-term benefits; this could be in the field of medicine, climate science, or technology. Expanding public-interest funding programs and increasing government-backed grants for research that cannot be patented would help level the playing field, ensuring that scientific discovery is driven by need, not just profit.</p><p>Decentralised funding models are emerging as an alternative to traditional grant structures. Platforms like ResearchHub, founded by Brian Armstrong, which uses blockchain technology and token incentives to support scientific collaboration and funding outside commercial constraints.</p><p>The internet gave us the tools to make scientific knowledge more open than ever, yet outdated publishing models continue to restrict it. Open-access platforms have begun to challenge this, but resistance from traditional academic publishers remains strong. If the goal of science is to expand human understanding, why are we still allowing corporate interests to decide who gets access to knowledge? Open-access publishing has proven to increase both the visibility and impact of research, while independent funding models demonstrate that science can thrive beyond corporate control. The real challenge is not just overcoming a system resistant to change. It's doing so without creating new barriers by shifting the financial burden onto academics.</p><p>Science Should Serve Humanity, Not Gatekeepers </p><p>Science is meant to push boundaries, challenge assumptions, and improve lives. Yet, the systems controlling it, peer review methods, funding models, and publishing restrictions are actively slowing progress. The issue isn't just profit but where it flows. Right now, too much of it goes to publishers that add little value while locking knowledge behind paywalls rather than supporting researchers and the advancement of science itself. A better system is possible, one that aligns financial sustainability with open access and genuine innovation.</p><p>The way we fund, review, and publish research today will shape the world of tomorrow, it's as simple as that. The question is no longer whether reform is needed, but whether we are willing to remove the gatekeepers standing in its way. If knowledge is truly meant to be for the benefit of all, then we need to start acting like it.</p><p>The greatest ideas, those that truly move humanity forward, shouldn't be trapped in bureaucracy \u2013 they should be free to change the world.</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://mpost.io/the-invisible-hand-in-science-who-really-controls-research-and-publishing/\">The Invisible Hand in Science: Who Really Controls Research and Publishing?</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://mpost.io\">Metaverse Post</url>.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mpost.io/wp-content/uploads/Expert-opinion-Ciaran-Murray-1920x1027-1-1-1024x548.jpg\">The Invisible Hand in Science: Who Really Controls Research and Publishing? - Image</url></p>", "publisher": "Metaverse Post", "instances": ["A 2024article in Accountability in Research found that research into non-commercial treatments receives far less funding than research into newly developed, patentable drugs.

It uses data to generate new things, such as text, images or code. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Singapore, one of the first institutes of higher learning that embedded forms of AI, such as machine learning, in its curriculum is the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), which opened in 2009.</p><p> Established as Singapore's fourth public university, it aims to advance knowledge and nurture technically grounded leaders and innovators to serve societal needs with a focus on design and technology.</p><p> Professor Khoo Peng Beng, Head of Pillar at SUTD's School of Architecture and Sustainable Design, joined the university earlier in 2025. He says AI has light and dark sides -- such as job displacement and ethical uses -- that need to be rigorously addressed through the university's curriculum.</p><p> While the university is inventing AI systems of the future, it is also conducting research on the philosophy and ethics of AI, called \"Design AI\". This is an intentional approach, as it is widely accepted that AI and human intelligence are partners in innovation. </p><p> \"As newer technologies like AI evolve, we have to increasingly sharpen our ability to discern what is good, what is the truth and what is beauty,\" says Prof Khoo, 56.</p><p> He says that AI itself is agnostic to either good or evil applications, and is dependent on the intention of the human user.</p><p> \"Of overarching importance is to keep human and AI goals aligned,\" he notes.</p><p> As futurists and inventors, design students speculate on all sorts of future possibilities.</p><p> For instance, they conduct research about the design of greener cities, the future of work and the future of healthcare. </p><p> These thought experiments, and the examination of both AI's light and dark sides, allow students to constantly create provocative scenarios that spark engagement and stimulate debate.</p><p> Students in Singapore also have some of the best teachers. About 20 SUTD lecturers are ranked among the \"World's Top 2%\", a list of leading scientists compiled by Stanford University in the US. </p><p> \"Our students are exposed to an exceptional research environment from their first year in university,\" says Prof Khoo. </p><p> \"Every project is a thought experiment about a speculative future or an exploration of experimental possibilities of existing phenomena.

Since 2009, SUTD graduates have commanded top dollar in the job market. </p><p> In a Straits Times report in April 2023, nine out of 10 SUTD graduates found jobs within six months of completing their final examinations, based on the school's 2023 graduate employment survey of 300 new graduates. </p><p> More than half of SUTD graduates secured full-time permanent employment in the sectors of information and communications, financial and insurance, and scientific research and development.</p><p> In February, the results of the Joint Graduate Employment Survey revealed that graduates of information and digital technologies courses continued to take home the highest monthly pay at $5,600, up from $5,500 in 2023. </p><p> ST scopes out five of SUTD's most ground-breaking AI projects.</p><p> Helping students flesh out bright ideasA new AI-powered design software converts doodles, sketches or simple shapes into layered architectural renders for pitching to design clients or for buildable architecture. </p><p> This is the invention of SUTD's Carlos Banon, associate professor of architecture and sustainable design. </p><p> For the past three years, he has integrated advanced diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) and conducted cutting-edge training in SUTD's first-year design workshops or \"studios\".</p><p> Advanced diffusion models are sophisticated machine learning algorithms that generate high-quality data. The application improves the connection between students' intuition and their visual output, boosting their creativity while helping them maintain control and ownership. </p><p> Prof Banon experienced first-hand the problem that designers grappled with to maintain control of and execute their vision using AI. His user-friendly application, which he christened FORMAS.AI -- \"formas\" is Spanish for \"forms\" -- turns sketches, coloured shapes and 3D images into textured visualisations and 3D-printable geometry with one click. </p><p> More than 2,000 architects, interior designers, educators and students globally are early users in the private beta version of the application, ahead of its end-Maypublic launch.</p><p> By making each step of the AI-driven creative process more transparent and controllable, users transition from being led by the AI's creations to actively guiding its development. This helps preserve their personal style while leveraging data-driven tools.</p><p> \"Since 2022, we have been integrating image-based diffusion models to enhance foundational design skills from the first semester at SUTD,\" says Prof Banon, 46. He is also the co-founder of Spanish architectural firm Subarquitectura Architects and co-founder of research laboratory AirLab@SUTD.</p><p> In his classes, students still draw on tracing paper and use cardboard study models, as they are encouraged to nurture primary thoughts and intuition. </p><p> But the moment a spark of brilliance takes shape, they sketch the idea and feed it into the FORMAS.AI model. It generates a realistic building image with materials and the surrounding environment for context.</p><p> \"In that way, our students develop a new kind of intuition, connecting very basic, abstract shapes and simple operations to complex spatial structures,\" says Prof Banon. \"They then develop new ways to operate in the world, reducing production time and focusing on vital areas revealed during the design process.\"</p><p> Currently, most AI image generators such as Midjourney are able to produce stunning visuals but drift far from the original vision or sketches, says Prof Banon. </p><p> On the other hand, FORMAS.AI's intuitive interface empowers designers to experiment and iterate using basic shapes. The output ranges from a high-resolution architectural rendering to an image that can be fed to 3D printers to produce a prototype.</p><p> \"Innovative architectural design often starts with a personal vision -- something only you notice about a site, the climate, a pattern of living,\" Prof Banon says. </p><p> \"It is that 'trained vision' that architects develop over time, something that can be transformative as we consider many factors -- combining science, art and technological intuition. AI should amplify and sharpen that hunch, not overshadow or replace it.\"</p><p>  Info: To see examples of what users globally are generating, go to FORMAS.AI </p><p> An AI-powered Design Brain for architectsWhen humans draw up architectural plans, they bring a lifetime of lived experiences, sensory input and emotional understanding to the table. They intuitively grasp spatial relationships, human needs and the feeling a space should evoke. </p><p> Currently, AI is unable to do this. An AI program needs to be fed large amounts of data which it identifies as patterns, recombining existing elements and optimising results within clearly defined parameters.</p><p> AI also lacks the physical and emotional experiences that shape human intuition about space and form. </p><p> Assistant professor Immanuel Koh of SUTD's Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar and Design and Artificial Intelligence programme is working on changing that. </p><p> His \"Design Brain\" project was conceived in 2024 with the aim of developing AI models capable of digesting, perceiving, understanding, learning, remembering, generating and evaluating designs -- specifically, architectural designs.</p><p> This is despite architecture being one of the most complex design disciplines in the world, demanding both creativity and logic.</p><p> Prof Koh has found that while there are many aspects to the project, the problem of spatial design reasoning -- and creative \"unreasoning\" -- is the most critical and difficult to solve.</p><p> For AI to truly power the design process and production, both humans and AI need to first communicate why, when and how specific design decisions are made during the iterative process.</p><p> \"It is difficult because it requires a transdisciplinary conceptual understanding and technical skills that lie at the intersection of design and AI,\" says Prof Koh, who also directs Artificial-Architecture at SUTD. </p><p> Artificial-Architecture is an interdisciplinary research laboratory that focuses on the design and development of deep learning models for artificial creativity, neurocognitive design, generative architecture, predictive urbanism and defence intelligence.</p><p> Artificial-Architecture has a slate of funded projects that include tie-ups with industry, academia and government agencies, such as AI Singapore and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.</p><p> Design Brain tries to create visible parallel chains of reasoning design actions throughout the process that can be performed, observed and augmented by human designers and autonomous software agents. An autonomous software agent is capable of making design decisions on its own.</p><p> \"I see AI as having the potential to not only automate or 'compress' existing design workflows that are currently conceived by human architects in a top-down manner, but also, even more radically, to un-automate or 'expand' existing design thinking habits that are yet to be conceived, using AI in a new bottom-up manner,\" says Prof Koh. </p><p> He worked with London-based design practice Zaha Hadid Architects from 2011 to 2014 before joining SUTD in 2019 to teach what he says is the world's first dedicated \"AI x Architecture\" module. </p><p> On Design Brain, Prof Koh says: \"The importance of this research lies in gaining a deeper mutual qualitative and quantitative understanding of the evolving gap between the intelligent architectural capabilities of AI and those of human architects. </p><p> \"At this point in time, it functions as a litmus test to see if an AI model can acquire the design skillsets of a human architect.\"</p><p> Analysing the ear canal through light imaging and machine learningAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), customised hearing aids can help cut the rate of cognitive decline by nearly half in seniors at a higher risk of dementia. </p><p> WHO says that nearly 2.5 billion people globally may have some degree of hearing loss by 2050, and more than 700 million will require hearing rehabilitation. </p><p> To create a more accurate mould of the outer ear for hearing aids, ear specialists in Singapore led by Dr Kenneth Chua, formerly from Changi General Hospital (CGH), collaborated with SUTD associate professor Stylianos Dritsas from 2020 to 2023. </p><p> Prof Dritsas teaches design computation and robotics, combining design, geometry, computing and manufacturing methods. </p><p> He worked with the CGH team to improve the way hearing aids are made, using machine learning. This is a field of study in AI centred on the development and study of algorithms that can learn from data and go on to create scenarios without relying on explicit instructions.</p><p> Fitting hearing aids typically involves injecting silicone into patients' ears. This produces ear canal moulds which are then scanned using 3D imaging to create digital ear canal impressions. </p><p> But before digital impressions can be used by doctors, the printouts require a lot of manual 3D editing. </p><p> Prof Dritsas and his team at SUTD helped Dr Chua -- now a principal audiologist at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre -- with computational methods to pre-process ear canal impressions. The project ended earlier in 2025, but there are plans for an extension to conduct more studies.  </p><p> The goal is to develop automated tools to help design better hearing aids. This will improve manufacturing and fitting the aids, and help standardise ear canal data for research purposes.</p><p> Prof Dritsas points out that in traditional computer programming, tasks that require visual intelligence and a qualitative assessment are very difficult to express via simple rules fed into a computer.</p><p> However, with AI, it is possible to provide enough examples for the computer program to understand the trends and patterns, and enable it to perform these tasks without explicitly being guided by a human.</p><p> \"The key finding of the ear canal project is that, unlike classical geometric analyses which require 'clean' or comprehensive data, the machine learning models are able to work with 'noisy' (incomplete) data from the real world,\" says Prof Dritsas, 48, a founding member of SUTD.</p><p> \"During the process, something unexpected happened,\" he recalls. </p><p> \"The machine learning model scrutinised the team's main printouts of the outer ear shapes thoroughly and was able to spot errors. This occurred because some of our data samples were off the general trend.</p><p> \"So, it provided highly intelligent guesses to improve the end-product.\"</p><p> Prof Dritsas says the machine learning model is a pioneering technology. One of its \"superpowers\" is the ability to make hyper-intelligent assessments for a final read-out that is more than 90 per cent accurate. </p><p> \"The model learnt something objective by combining subjective opinions of experts and collective knowledge from the team,\" he adds.</p><p>  \"This is something very powerful about machine learning that is not yet well understood, and which has enormous potential.\"</p><p> Sharing knowledge about coastal protectionProtecting coastlines from rising sea levels due to climate change is a top priority, says SUTD professor of practice Eva Castro from the Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar.</p><p> As the director of the Centre for Climate Adaptation (CCA), housed within the Upper Changi campus, she uses AI to generate visualisations of projected scenarios faster than in previous years, when the technology was not so advanced.</p><p> Instead of manually selecting chart types and visual encodings, AI-powered tools can automatically suggest the most effective visualisations to represent data and highlight key insights. </p><p> This allows Prof Castro to ideate and iterate large-scale infrastructure proposals for coastal resilience that can be shared across borders to help stakeholders such as overseas researchers, scientists and government agencies.</p><p> AI has also helped to break down complex design concepts for stakeholders to access and comprehend information that would otherwise be understood only by specialists or experts.</p><p> \"The CCA agenda is centred on archipelagos, so we have been working with coastal areas, developing a new understanding of the meaning of coastal resilience and the role the ocean plays within it, designing hybrid as well as nature-based solutions to inhabit possible futures,\" says Prof Castro, 53.</p><p> One of CCA's ongoing research programmes is the Long Island project, which involves reclaiming land at higher levels off East Coast and placing them in the form of \"islands\" located a distance away from the existing coastline.</p><p> The programme, aimed at helping Singapore's efforts in coastal protection, is expected to reclaim about 800ha of land off East Coast.</p><p> It will be progressively implemented from 2030 and will stretch over a few decades, according to national water agency PUB.</p><p> Prof Castro says the aim of her work is to produce more inclusive processes of design that help in sharing knowledge and engaging society at large.</p><p> \"As designers, we want to promote the importance of our role within the infrastructural projects that define the cities we inhabit,\" she says. \"In doing so, we believe we are strategists who know how to operate across diverse scales and typologies.\"</p><p> Collaborative intelligence, instead of artificial intelligenceArchitecture graduate and PhD candidate Daryl Ho believes AI will not take over the jobs of humans, but will be more of a reliable assistant to designers. Think collaborative intelligence rather than artificial intelligence, he says.</p><p> The 30-year-old is working on a few \"wonder\", or speculative, projects, which look into how the medium of extended reality (XR) can augment the way humans interact with AI beyond the standard user interface. </p><p> The way humans engage with AI should not be limited to buttons and text prompts, he says. Through XR, users can make use of space for new forms of interaction and collaboration with AI.</p><p> \"One of my projects looks into how AI can be a creative partner that helps users design their own virtual environments,\" says Mr Ho, whose research is in understanding XR through the perspective of an architect designing spaces for people to interact in. </p><p> His goal is to find ways for people to curate their own spaces within the metaverse or virtual world, not only through appearance, but also via interactivity with the environment. </p><p> In this project, AI collaborates with the users, responding to their actions through sounds, colour and placing design suggestions of its own. </p><p> This allows designers within a virtual environment to create together with AI in a social, embodied manner.</p><p> Another project looks at how AI can redefine how people interact with information, not as static elements taken from a webpage, but as dynamic agents that respond to the user and one another. </p><p> \"Much of the information we find online is presented to us through search engines, websites and online repositories that for the large part remain static 2D interfaces,\" he says.</p><p> \"Through XR and AI, we can change the way a person receives and makes sense of information.\"</p><p> Imagine information as little AI helpers living inside a virtual world. Instead of just looking at words and pictures on a screen, one can interact with these AI helpers directly. </p><p> This allows the individual to explore information in a dynamic 3D way, beyond the flat screen of the computer.</p><p> \"The metaverse is still a nascent force,\" adds Mr Ho, highlighting that its implications make it an important future for designers to speculate about. If XR and AI become ubiquitous at a scale akin to that of the internet now, how does one engage with such spaces'</p><p> \"My research looks into tapping the principles of the metaverse to find novel ways in which we might be able to work, create and play with an ever-evolving digital landscape.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["\"This is something very powerful about machine learning that is not yet well understood, and which has enormous potential.

This allows Prof Castro to ideate and iterate large-scale infrastructure proposals for coastal resilience that can be shared across borders to help stakeholders such as overseas researchers, scientists and government agencies."]}, {"relevance_score": 14, "title": "Proving efficacy of climate adaptation plans will differentiate who gets funding: Moody's", "published": "2022-10-24", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">EFFECTIVE climate adaptation is critical in nations' efforts to reduce the fiscal, socioeconomic and environmental impacts of extreme weather events and long-term climate change -- but many are struggling to prove the efficacy of their plans and access needed funding.</p><p> A Moody's report, out on Friday, said that proving effective action when it comes to adaptation plans will be a crucial differentiating factor when it comes to obtaining credit -- with such an indicator of credit risk being especially important for those whose exposure to physical climate risk is most material.</p><p> Citing a Climate Policy Initiative report, published in December, Moody's noted that only a quarter of the annual spending on adaptation projects needed to reduce the associated risks globally is currently being met.

It's really a privilege to have the two of you here on stage, and it is a record turnout for us this year. I think we know why. Everyone's here to hear you and also to learn about how you are moving philanthropic capital-because we know that that's the capital that can tolerate the most risk, and the world is at risk.</p><p>It's a world where we are seeing rules-maybe all changed-trade flows affected, aid flows affected. So, if there was a mission you were on to solve one global challenge, what would it be? And if you had a hundred billion dollars, where would you place it?</p><p>Climate adaptation-Ravi would be happy. Nutrition-I know the Rockefeller folks would be very, very happy. Disease elimination-Gates has been with us on that. Global jobs crisis-you talked a lot about that as well, President Tharman.</p><p>What are the big bets and the trade-offs for philanthropy to step up?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, President of the Republic of Singapore and Distinguished Patron of Philanthropy Asia Alliance: Well, I have a little less experience in spending a hundred billion dollars than Bill has, so I will address the question differently.</p><p>We have a problem. There's a step change that's taking place in the global aid landscape. It's not just the US. It's the European countries, and more broadly, you add it all up together - even with China stepping up somewhat - there's a significant reduction in aid monies. And I don't think that's going to change soon.</p><p>So we have to find ways in which this doesn't lead to catastrophe - greater global hunger, more epidemics, or other maladjustments and conflicts in the world.</p><p>It is possible to achieve this, but we've got to get more value out of every aid dollar spent.</p><p>We need a step up in resources - public sector resources within countries, philanthropic money, and private finance - but it's not just about volumes, but effectiveness.</p><p>So if you think of how we can best deploy even a billion dollars, I think we first have to refocus on building up the domestic capacity within countries for them to be more self-sufficient. For sure, many will still require significant international support, through the multilateral development banks, through various bilateral schemes and through initiatives such as what we are trying to grow here.</p><p>But building up domestic tax capacity, building up the ability to execute budgets more effectively, is an extremely important challenge, and is doable. It's not a hopeless case at all. What many don't realise is that in the lowest-income regions of the world, several countries have significantly increased their tax revenues - by at least two to three percentage points of GDP, without loss to economic growth. It's doable.</p><p>But there's a capacity issue. There are, of course, political issues in some countries, but there's a capacity issue. How can we digitise tax systems? How can we build more efficient administration of tax collection, and enforcement systems?</p><p>So that's a very important challenge, and there's an interaction between the efforts that countries themselves make and the amount of support they're going to get internationally: from philanthropies, from the MDBs, from other governments that still are providing bilateral support.</p><p>Developing capacity within countries has to be a renewed priority. Besides tax administration, there are other areas. Gates Foundation, amongst others, has funded the African CDC. Excellent example, well run, with exceptional leaders. A good example of how countries in Africa have gotten together to develop capabilities of their own.</p><p>There are other examples to do with training people to reform health and agricultural systems - training PhDs, Master's graduates digitising systems. There's still huge potential for capacity development in Asia and in the developing world at large. It has to be a priority.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Okay, we hear you then, President Tharman-build the capacity, and then we'll be ready for the challenges, whatever the challenge might be.</p><p>Bill-spending a hundred billion-to do good. You are the one with the most experience here on this stage. Where would you put it?</p><p>Bill Gates, Chair and Trustee, Gates Foundation: Yeah. So the Gates Foundation is celebrating its 25th anniversary. It was in the year 2000 when I first got started, and during those 25 years, we've given a little bit more than a hundred billion.</p><p>When we started out, we didn't know what impact we'd be able to have, and we saw some really awful things. You know, for example, because malaria was a disease only in poor countries, there was no work being done on malaria drugs or bed nets or any technique to reduce those deaths. When vaccines were first designed, they weren't cost-reduced. Vaccines like pneumococcus and rotavirus were so expensive, they were only going to children in rich countries-who were at almost no risk of dying of rotavirus-and over a million kids were dying of this diarrhoeal disease.</p><p>So we thought, okay, there's something that the market doesn't get. Because it's profit-driven, it does a lot of great things, but saving children's lives-it doesn't do well.</p><p>At the turn of the century, over 10 million children were dying every year who were under the age of five. And through not just us, but rich countries giving to things like Gavi, that bought vaccines, and the Global Fund, which worked on malaria, TB, and HIV-we've cut that child death rate from 10 million a year to below 5 million a year.</p><p>And so it's, you know, pretty phenomenal. Part of it is the R&amp;D piece-of inventing new tools-and part of it is the delivery piece, and that's where the partners have been key.</p><p>You know, to eradicate polio, the world needs to spend another about $5 billion to get rid of that. To eradicate malaria-which is still killing 600,000 a year-we'll need about $15 billion to do that.</p><p>Malnutrition is this evil thing that both makes you twice as likely to die-because you're just not as strong-and even if you do survive, your brain and your body never develop. And so 40 percent of kids in Sub-Saharan Africa don't achieve their potential.</p><p>So I go against all of those things. In fact, I'm lucky enough that over the next 10 years, because we've grown, I'll spend another hundred billion. But I would say-and the President made this point-you know, we could save lives for a few thousand dollars per life saved.</p><p>So if you buy bed nets, if you buy medicines for neglected tropical diseases-even a gift of a million dollars, or even less-can make a huge difference. Because the field of global health, even in the toughest countries, is now quite mature. We measure the outcome. We know what's working, what's not working. And we have a track record of success.</p><p>And so it's great-we're having some fellow philanthropists come together on health issues in this region, where people will be able to go and see the impact of their generosity.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know Bill, listening to you, I must say there's something I need to understand. You say it's your 25th anniversary, and anniversaries are full of celebration-a point of reflection and inflection-but this year has also been a year for some hard rethinks and resets for you. But you're full of optimism. Where does this optimism come from?</p><p>Bill Gates: Well, I would think of global health, which is the biggest area we work in. We work in agriculture and education and some other areas as well, but 70 percent of our money is in the research and the delivery of global health-because we saw such a tragedy and a market failure there.</p><p>I would divide global health into three eras. There's the last 25 years, with the great results. Then we have a period here which will last from four to ten years, where we have a lot less money. And some of these poor countries, particularly in Africa, are very indebted-and nobody's giving them the debt relief. So their financial situation is very, very weak.</p><p>And as was mentioned, the aid budgets-in the US, the tentative proposal is an 80 percent cut. We will go to the Congress and try to convince them to not be nearly that dramatic. But as Europe looks at its military spending and ageing society-and they've been the most generous, over twice as generous as other countries: Sweden and Norway in particular, but also France, Germany, the UK-we're going to have a tough period here.</p><p>And the only reason that the deaths won't go back to 10 million is that we do have innovative tools-and we have a pipeline of innovative tools. We have ways of protecting girls from getting HIV. We have new vaccines. We have an understanding of malnutrition. We have ways of stopping women from bleeding to death after delivery that only cost a few dollars in drugs.</p><p>So our teams come to Singapore and say, okay, let's find some of these research projects. Thank goodness for innovation-or else these funding cuts could drive us back almost to that 10 million a year. I'll be an advocate that the idea of helping children survive and preventing HIV deaths is no less important today. And so this sort of wave of not caring for other countries-I feel it'll be reversed. At least, I'll spend a lot of my time trying to make the case for that.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: To add to what Bill has said - and the thinking behind what you've been doing is very similar to our thinking in Singapore. We are faced with the shortage of development finance, and have to prioritise how it's going to be used. And apart from my point about building up capacity within beneficiary countries, we've got to deploy philanthropic and public monies as effectively as possible.</p><p>The approach you're talking about, and many of the examples you've been involved in like Gavi, have involved first investing in innovations, piloting them on a small scale to see what works, before then scaling up the interventions with proven impact. And I think that should be an important mindset in development funding - pilot, then scale up the proven interventions.</p><p>A reason for optimism is that it's actually working very well. If you look at Gavi, just as an example, every dollar given to Gavi and spent by Gavi on proven interventions leads eventually to $54 of returns. By returns, I mean not just financial returns, but broader economic and social returns-healthier and more productive lives for everyone.</p><p>And that's actually the type of thinking - thinking about impact, and on the full returns on what we spend - that should motivate philanthropic giving and investments, as well as motivate the global public sector. We are doing this not just out of the goodness of our hearts. We are doing this not just because there is an important moral cause-but because we are all better off living in a world where every country has populations that lead healthier and productive lives. We are all safer, and we are all better off.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Indeed, President Tharman. You know, each time we listen to you, each time we hear you, we are grateful that you are the patron of Philanthropy Asia Alliance. There's so much that needs to be done, and your wisdom has spurred us on. And we also know that-like Bill-you love innovation, and innovation in Asia is something you have told us repeatedly to be scaling, to be working hard on. Innovation, and what Asia can do for the world-what do you see of that?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Well, there's lots that, again, Bill will have to say, and there's lots that many of you are already doing. The innovations that catch the news typically are about breakthroughs in technology, which are extremely important. We can come back to that-the potential for example for AI to enable a whole set of more effective social interventions, or better agriculture.</p><p>But innovation also involves organisation. For instance, if you look at India, one of the unsung successes is what they call the Aspirational Districts Programme. A well-chosen name for the most underdeveloped districts in India. This was Prime Minister Modi's initiative. I believe Gates Foundation joined Piramal Foundation and Tata Trusts in helping to fund it.</p><p>It gives ownership to the community-developing community health workers, para-nurses, and data systems, supported from the centre - targeted especially at maternal health and health of the child in the earliest years. Monitoring growth, month by month, monitoring nutritional intake, and making sure that circle of actions and remedies is closed at the local level. I've visited some of those districts, and seen how they are working because they give ownership and agency on the ground to the people in the village themselves-who know who the mothers are, who know who the absent fathers are, who know who the kids are who are a little smaller than others, and where something needs to be done to remedy that before they end up stunted. It's a very interesting example of innovation that can be of interest beyond India, elsewhere in the developing world.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Asian solutions for the globe are just as important. Bill, you are in Southeast Asia. We know you are here on a very tight and busy schedule. Tell us what you're doing in Singapore, what you're going to be doing with Southeast Asia.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah, so I'm here for two days, but with a great agenda-seeing a lot of the leaders here. My Gates Foundation work is what I put the most time into, but I also do a lot of work on climate change through a group called Breakthrough Energy. And both of those organisations are very excited about what's going on in Singapore.</p><p>The Gates Foundation is putting an office here-to access the science, to partner with the philanthropic community.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: An office here in Singapore?</p><p>Bill Gates: Yes.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Gates is opening an office here in Singapore? Thank you for that.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah, it's really to partner with philanthropists, to partner with the research being done here. Likewise, Breakthrough Energy has a very deep relationship with Temasek and a growing relationship with GIC. We've done things like fund innovative clean energy work through what we call our fellows programme. So I'll get to meet the first four of those, and that's a growing programme we're doing together with the top universities here.</p><p>I would say that Asian innovation is a part of why I am so excited about the progress we can make in health. Initially, when we thought of Asian innovation, we mostly thought about low cost-which is a great thing. I mean, the lowest cost vaccines in the world are made in India, Indonesia-this region.</p><p>But more and more, the innovation is about cutting-edge work. Genomics data that, when you combine it with AI, will help us understand what is the disease prevalence, what differences are there across all the diverse populations here. One of the scenarios we have for AI is that just talking to your phone in whatever language you use, you should get medical advice that's as good or better than you would get if you had a doctor with you all of the time. That health scenario will be enabled by AI.</p><p>The farmers in this region need advice about weather, which variety, and plant disease. We're piloting using the AI to give them advice where it'll know about their soils and their land and what the pricing looks like. It's the innovation pipeline-a lot of which will be developed in this region-that means even with these aid cuts, although we will try and get them reversed, I do see even the toughest challenges like malaria, HIV-I do see us being able to solve those in the next 25 years.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, Bill, we have to ask you to add dengue to that list. You talk about malaria, which is definitely very important. But within Southeast Asia, and really with the tropical parts of the world getting warmer, we're seeing dengue in other parts of the world as well. Will you add that to the solutioning as well?</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. We've been a big funder. We were the ones who funded this Wolbachia work down in Australia. That was a Gates Grand Challenge back in 2003. We jointly funded the work in Yogyakarta with an Indonesian family foundation who funded that rollout. That has benefited - It doesn't completely get rid of the dengue, but it drops the level pretty dramatically.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: -by about 70 percent.</p><p>Bill Gates: And we have some of our vaccine partners, including Sanofi and Takeda, who've worked on vaccines. We're going to need a next-generation vaccine to completely solve it. The dengue vaccine turns out to be quite challenging, but it is possible. We funded the early development of this mRNA, and so a lot of the new vaccines will be reformulated. And instead of using a needle, which a lot of people don't like, we're just going to have a little patch that you can self-apply. And it doesn't have any pain-or so we hope.</p><p>Whether it's just in general to get higher vaccination rates, or particularly in a pandemic, the fact that you could distribute this thing and just self-apply it rather than going into healthcare would be pretty dramatic. And so there's a lot of lessons coming out of the COVID pandemic that will help us with the current infectious diseases, but also would allow us to deal far, far better when-and sadly, it's not if, it's when-the next big pandemic challenge comes around.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, we work very closely with the Gates team. So, you know, I'm sure dengue will be part of what's going on.</p><p>It sounds like we're asking for it, but it's something that we really go through quite a fair bit in Southeast Asia as well. It'll be great to see the malaria problem maybe broaden into a mosquito challenge for you.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. For some of our diseases-it sounds awful to say this-but we're almost glad there's some cases in rich areas, like dengue in Singapore. I mean, it's a terrible thing to say. But, you know, it means that the priority for doing that-you know, HIV, it's tragic that it's everywhere. But part of the reason a lot of global health things like PEPFAR, Global Fund, they got created because the citizens in the US could see the tragedy of HIV. And when you said, should anyone in the world die just because we don't have the $100 a year to buy these ARV medicines? We managed, at least in that time, to get a strong bipartisan response to that. That's one of the things that's at risk, and we're going to have to re-explain to US politicians why they should stay engaged in that.</p><p>When you have a disease like malaria or malnutrition that's really only in the poor countries, then we really need to get people to come and see it. Of course, here in Singapore, the range of income levels and disease burdens just in the region is quite dramatic. You know- in Papua New Guinea-there's still some significant burdens. And of course, this is a region where we'd love to get rid of both dengue and malaria and have that be an example so the rest of the world can do the same thing.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Indeed. Whatever we ask for through Philanthropy Asia Alliance, we ask not only for Singapore, but we ask for the region-because that's important to us.</p><p>Bill Gates: Fantastic.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: President Tharman, you know we've been following your speeches over the years around philanthropy as well. And really, it was at the inaugural PAS that you talked about the move-the need for that move-from cheque-book philanthropy to catalytic philanthropy. Have you seen philanthropists pick up on that idea?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: I think if you look at our new landscape of philanthropy, including the family offices, there's a generation of philanthropic leaders now who really want to see impact in what they're doing. And that impact is not completely dislodged from looking at financial returns, but they want more than that. They want to see social impact. They want to see a broader impact on the lives of beneficiaries.</p><p>So I think the thinking has shifted. And it's important now to develop the methods that allow us to measure impact so that-to go back to the earlier point-we can put more resources into proven interventions and scale them up.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, when you speak of the shift in generation-and from what we are seeing through some of our efforts throughout the Temasek Trust ecosystem-we find it very interesting that the younger, well, not quite philanthropists, but maybe would-be philanthropists through their own wealth management platforms-they save, they invest.</p><p>Or at least when I was growing up, if I was savvy about my personal finances, I would save well, I would invest well, and that was what my platform was all about. We have found that the wealth platforms of today are including philanthropy in it-the young people whom they are trying to attract onto their apps, their wealth apps-are asking for philanthropy options to be part of it. Because they know to be savvy today in your personal finances is to give as well as to save.</p><p>So that's been an interesting shift that we've seen as well. But how do we get more, Bill, of the young people at least to see their $1 million, their $10,000, or even their $100 as making a difference? Not everyone moves a hundred billion.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. Well, the Gates Foundation is trying to encourage philanthropy, both by people of great wealth-you know, we have a thing called the Giving Pledge that we have about 300 people who've committed to giving away the majority of their wealth during their lifetime or through their will. And so that's kind of a community.</p><p>But we also-you know, there's a day in the United States called Giving Tuesday, where we really talk about help your local teacher, help your local food bank, or help us succeed with polio eradication-where even $10 donations, you know, we say a bed net that protects a child, a vaccine that protects a girl from cervical cancer-that's actually $2 to buy that vaccine.</p><p>In the US, philanthropy is about 2 percent of the economy, so small compared to private sector and government, but globally it's about half a percent. And so the US is a little bit ahead on that. And it's interesting to think, okay, why is that? Is it the tax incentives? That may be part of it. Is it that we know the government can't solve all problems? And so there's this kind of self-reliance, local community groups-that's part of it.</p><p>We'd like to really spread this idea. A very big giving-you know, the most honourable givers are those who are actually making some sacrifice. And of course, when I give, I'm making no sacrifice at all. And so it's very praiseworthy. But helping people know that the money will be well used and they get a sense-I thought in the digital era, philanthropy would take off even more. As yet, we've only seen that in a very modest way.</p><p>And so I still believe we can do it, because we can connect the donor and have them see the outcome. We can't get everybody to go to the site of the actual work. And it's in those poor areas that the impact per dollar is dramatically higher. I'm not saying all philanthropy should be that, but that's-you know, I'm doing that with 90 percent of my resources.</p><p>In the US, about 5 percent of philanthropic giving leaves the country. So a lot of it is domestic, which is just fine.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: I think there's an important opportunity for philanthropy in this part of the world, which is moving beyond traditional charity towards addressing the largest problems that the region faces-and the world faces-through local action. And one of the least noticed large problems has to do with food systems and nutrition.</p><p>It's a looming crisis that isn't focused on very much because it's a slow-burning crisis. We have reached the limits of traditional ways of producing food - both by ordinary smallholder farmers as well as in industrial agriculture. We've reached the limits because it is too large a source of greenhouse gas emissions; we can't keep encroaching into natural forests and other natural ecosystems; and also because soil health has deteriorated very significantly.</p><p>In fact, there's been a step reduction in moisture in the soil over the last 20 years that now makes the land much more susceptible to droughts, much less able to be a sink for carbon, and much less able to grow plants with a reasonable yield. So we have a real challenge in how we grow food in future.</p><p>And on the demand side, we have the reverse. We have an explosion of demand. We have about 1.7 billion people being added to the world's population in the next 25 years. In fact, in the next 10 years, we have about 800 million people. And we have a much larger increase in food and nutrition demand - by some 50-75% over the next 25 years - because a large group of lower-middle-income people aspire to become middle class.</p><p>So food demand is going up. Supply is going to be constrained. We have to revolutionise food systems. We need a new Green Revolution-and a truly green revolution that uses less water, allows more moisture to stay in the soil, involves less methane emissions from rice cultivation especially, and less greenhouse gas emissions in general. And that still gives farmers a better yield.</p><p>And it's possible. One of the initiatives that Philanthropy Asia Alliance has launched is Decarbonising Rice. Using new seed varieties or new strains that are more resistant to droughts and floods. New cultivation techniques that use much less water. There have been large-scale trials now in India and elsewhere that have seen significant improvements in farmers' yields, a 50% reduction in water requirements, and 20-50% percent reductions in methane emissions.</p><p>So this is a large challenge. It involves all of us, because if we don't solve it, many more people in the world are going to go hungry in the years to come, and everyone else is going to see an increase in the cost of living, because food prices are going to go up. So we really need to focus on this - transform how rice is cultivated - in order that farmers can still have good incomes, populations can have good nutrition, including the poor especially, and the cost of living doesn't need to go up over time.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Thank you, President Tharman. Bill, before we go-thank you for opening the office in Singapore. What do you want to see from this region, where innovation and philanthropy are concerned?</p><p>Bill Gates: Well, we're already seeing a lot of great philanthropists here. And I think people are very family-oriented.

It's really a privilege to have the two of you here on stage, and it is a record turnout for us this year. I think we know why. Everyone's here to hear you and also to learn about how you are moving philanthropic capital-because we know that that's the capital that can tolerate the most risk, and the world is at risk.</p><p>It's a world where we are seeing rules-maybe all changed-trade flows affected, aid flows affected. So, if there was a mission you were on to solve one global challenge, what would it be? And if you had a hundred billion dollars, where would you place it?</p><p>Climate adaptation-Ravi would be happy. Nutrition-I know the Rockefeller folks would be very, very happy. Disease elimination-Gates has been with us on that. Global jobs crisis-you talked a lot about that as well, President Tharman.</p><p>What are the big bets and the trade-offs for philanthropy to step up?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, President of the Republic of Singapore and Distinguished Patron of Philanthropy Asia Alliance: Well, I have a little less experience in spending a hundred billion dollars than Bill has, so I will address the question differently.</p><p>We have a problem. There's a step change that's taking place in the global aid landscape. It's not just the US. It's the European countries, and more broadly, you add it all up together - even with China stepping up somewhat - there's a significant reduction in aid monies. And I don't think that's going to change soon.</p><p>So we have to find ways in which this doesn't lead to catastrophe - greater global hunger, more epidemics, or other maladjustments and conflicts in the world.</p><p>It is possible to achieve this, but we've got to get more value out of every aid dollar spent.</p><p>We need a step up in resources - public sector resources within countries, philanthropic money, and private finance - but it's not just about volumes, but effectiveness.</p><p>So if you think of how we can best deploy even a billion dollars, I think we first have to refocus on building up the domestic capacity within countries for them to be more self-sufficient. For sure, many will still require significant international support, through the multilateral development banks, through various bilateral schemes and through initiatives such as what we are trying to grow here.</p><p>But building up domestic tax capacity, building up the ability to execute budgets more effectively, is an extremely important challenge, and is doable. It's not a hopeless case at all. What many don't realise is that in the lowest-income regions of the world, several countries have significantly increased their tax revenues - by at least two to three percentage points of GDP, without loss to economic growth. It's doable.</p><p>But there's a capacity issue. There are, of course, political issues in some countries, but there's a capacity issue. How can we digitise tax systems? How can we build more efficient administration of tax collection, and enforcement systems?</p><p>So that's a very important challenge, and there's an interaction between the efforts that countries themselves make and the amount of support they're going to get internationally: from philanthropies, from the MDBs, from other governments that still are providing bilateral support.</p><p>Developing capacity within countries has to be a renewed priority. Besides tax administration, there are other areas. Gates Foundation, amongst others, has funded the African CDC. Excellent example, well run, with exceptional leaders. A good example of how countries in Africa have gotten together to develop capabilities of their own.</p><p>There are other examples to do with training people to reform health and agricultural systems - training PhDs, Master's graduates digitising systems. There's still huge potential for capacity development in Asia and in the developing world at large. It has to be a priority.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Okay, we hear you then, President Tharman-build the capacity, and then we'll be ready for the challenges, whatever the challenge might be.</p><p>Bill-spending a hundred billion-to do good. You are the one with the most experience here on this stage. Where would you put it?</p><p>Bill Gates, Chair and Trustee, Gates Foundation: Yeah. So the Gates Foundation is celebrating its 25th anniversary. It was in the year 2000 when I first got started, and during those 25 years, we've given a little bit more than a hundred billion.</p><p>When we started out, we didn't know what impact we'd be able to have, and we saw some really awful things. You know, for example, because malaria was a disease only in poor countries, there was no work being done on malaria drugs or bed nets or any technique to reduce those deaths. When vaccines were first designed, they weren't cost-reduced. Vaccines like pneumococcus and rotavirus were so expensive, they were only going to children in rich countries-who were at almost no risk of dying of rotavirus-and over a million kids were dying of this diarrhoeal disease.</p><p>So we thought, okay, there's something that the market doesn't get. Because it's profit-driven, it does a lot of great things, but saving children's lives-it doesn't do well.</p><p>At the turn of the century, over 10 million children were dying every year who were under the age of five. And through not just us, but rich countries giving to things like Gavi, that bought vaccines, and the Global Fund, which worked on malaria, TB, and HIV-we've cut that child death rate from 10 million a year to below 5 million a year.</p><p>And so it's, you know, pretty phenomenal. Part of it is the R&amp;D piece-of inventing new tools-and part of it is the delivery piece, and that's where the partners have been key.</p><p>You know, to eradicate polio, the world needs to spend another about $5 billion to get rid of that. To eradicate malaria-which is still killing 600,000 a year-we'll need about $15 billion to do that.</p><p>Malnutrition is this evil thing that both makes you twice as likely to die-because you're just not as strong-and even if you do survive, your brain and your body never develop. And so 40 percent of kids in Sub-Saharan Africa don't achieve their potential.</p><p>So I go against all of those things. In fact, I'm lucky enough that over the next 10 years, because we've grown, I'll spend another hundred billion. But I would say-and the President made this point-you know, we could save lives for a few thousand dollars per life saved.</p><p>So if you buy bed nets, if you buy medicines for neglected tropical diseases-even a gift of a million dollars, or even less-can make a huge difference. Because the field of global health, even in the toughest countries, is now quite mature. We measure the outcome. We know what's working, what's not working. And we have a track record of success.</p><p>And so it's great-we're having some fellow philanthropists come together on health issues in this region, where people will be able to go and see the impact of their generosity.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know Bill, listening to you, I must say there's something I need to understand. You say it's your 25th anniversary, and anniversaries are full of celebration-a point of reflection and inflection-but this year has also been a year for some hard rethinks and resets for you. But you're full of optimism. Where does this optimism come from?</p><p>Bill Gates: Well, I would think of global health, which is the biggest area we work in. We work in agriculture and education and some other areas as well, but 70 percent of our money is in the research and the delivery of global health-because we saw such a tragedy and a market failure there.</p><p>I would divide global health into three eras. There's the last 25 years, with the great results. Then we have a period here which will last from four to ten years, where we have a lot less money. And some of these poor countries, particularly in Africa, are very indebted-and nobody's giving them the debt relief. So their financial situation is very, very weak.</p><p>And as was mentioned, the aid budgets-in the US, the tentative proposal is an 80 percent cut. We will go to the Congress and try to convince them to not be nearly that dramatic. But as Europe looks at its military spending and ageing society-and they've been the most generous, over twice as generous as other countries: Sweden and Norway in particular, but also France, Germany, the UK-we're going to have a tough period here.</p><p>And the only reason that the deaths won't go back to 10 million is that we do have innovative tools-and we have a pipeline of innovative tools. We have ways of protecting girls from getting HIV. We have new vaccines. We have an understanding of malnutrition. We have ways of stopping women from bleeding to death after delivery that only cost a few dollars in drugs.</p><p>So our teams come to Singapore and say, okay, let's find some of these research projects. Thank goodness for innovation-or else these funding cuts could drive us back almost to that 10 million a year. I'll be an advocate that the idea of helping children survive and preventing HIV deaths is no less important today. And so this sort of wave of not caring for other countries-I feel it'll be reversed. At least, I'll spend a lot of my time trying to make the case for that.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: To add to what Bill has said - and the thinking behind what you've been doing is very similar to our thinking in Singapore. We are faced with the shortage of development finance, and have to prioritise how it's going to be used. And apart from my point about building up capacity within beneficiary countries, we've got to deploy philanthropic and public monies as effectively as possible.</p><p>The approach you're talking about, and many of the examples you've been involved in like Gavi, have involved first investing in innovations, piloting them on a small scale to see what works, before then scaling up the interventions with proven impact. And I think that should be an important mindset in development funding - pilot, then scale up the proven interventions.</p><p>A reason for optimism is that it's actually working very well. If you look at Gavi, just as an example, every dollar given to Gavi and spent by Gavi on proven interventions leads eventually to $54 of returns. By returns, I mean not just financial returns, but broader economic and social returns-healthier and more productive lives for everyone.</p><p>And that's actually the type of thinking - thinking about impact, and on the full returns on what we spend - that should motivate philanthropic giving and investments, as well as motivate the global public sector. We are doing this not just out of the goodness of our hearts. We are doing this not just because there is an important moral cause-but because we are all better off living in a world where every country has populations that lead healthier and productive lives. We are all safer, and we are all better off.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Indeed, President Tharman. You know, each time we listen to you, each time we hear you, we are grateful that you are the patron of Philanthropy Asia Alliance. There's so much that needs to be done, and your wisdom has spurred us on. And we also know that-like Bill-you love innovation, and innovation in Asia is something you have told us repeatedly to be scaling, to be working hard on. Innovation, and what Asia can do for the world-what do you see of that?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Well, there's lots that, again, Bill will have to say, and there's lots that many of you are already doing. The innovations that catch the news typically are about breakthroughs in technology, which are extremely important. We can come back to that-the potential for example for AI to enable a whole set of more effective social interventions, or better agriculture.</p><p>But innovation also involves organisation. For instance, if you look at India, one of the unsung successes is what they call the Aspirational Districts Programme. A well-chosen name for the most underdeveloped districts in India. This was Prime Minister Modi's initiative. I believe Gates Foundation joined Piramal Foundation and Tata Trusts in helping to fund it.</p><p>It gives ownership to the community-developing community health workers, para-nurses, and data systems, supported from the centre - targeted especially at maternal health and health of the child in the earliest years. Monitoring growth, month by month, monitoring nutritional intake, and making sure that circle of actions and remedies is closed at the local level. I've visited some of those districts, and seen how they are working because they give ownership and agency on the ground to the people in the village themselves-who know who the mothers are, who know who the absent fathers are, who know who the kids are who are a little smaller than others, and where something needs to be done to remedy that before they end up stunted. It's a very interesting example of innovation that can be of interest beyond India, elsewhere in the developing world.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Asian solutions for the globe are just as important. Bill, you are in Southeast Asia. We know you are here on a very tight and busy schedule. Tell us what you're doing in Singapore, what you're going to be doing with Southeast Asia.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah, so I'm here for two days, but with a great agenda-seeing a lot of the leaders here. My Gates Foundation work is what I put the most time into, but I also do a lot of work on climate change through a group called Breakthrough Energy. And both of those organisations are very excited about what's going on in Singapore.</p><p>The Gates Foundation is putting an office here-to access the science, to partner with the philanthropic community.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: An office here in Singapore?</p><p>Bill Gates: Yes.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Gates is opening an office here in Singapore? Thank you for that.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah, it's really to partner with philanthropists, to partner with the research being done here. Likewise, Breakthrough Energy has a very deep relationship with Temasek and a growing relationship with GIC. We've done things like fund innovative clean energy work through what we call our fellows programme. So I'll get to meet the first four of those, and that's a growing programme we're doing together with the top universities here.</p><p>I would say that Asian innovation is a part of why I am so excited about the progress we can make in health. Initially, when we thought of Asian innovation, we mostly thought about low cost-which is a great thing. I mean, the lowest cost vaccines in the world are made in India, Indonesia-this region.</p><p>But more and more, the innovation is about cutting-edge work. Genomics data that, when you combine it with AI, will help us understand what is the disease prevalence, what differences are there across all the diverse populations here. One of the scenarios we have for AI is that just talking to your phone in whatever language you use, you should get medical advice that's as good or better than you would get if you had a doctor with you all of the time. That health scenario will be enabled by AI.</p><p>The farmers in this region need advice about weather, which variety, and plant disease. We're piloting using the AI to give them advice where it'll know about their soils and their land and what the pricing looks like. It's the innovation pipeline-a lot of which will be developed in this region-that means even with these aid cuts, although we will try and get them reversed, I do see even the toughest challenges like malaria, HIV-I do see us being able to solve those in the next 25 years.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, Bill, we have to ask you to add dengue to that list. You talk about malaria, which is definitely very important. But within Southeast Asia, and really with the tropical parts of the world getting warmer, we're seeing dengue in other parts of the world as well. Will you add that to the solutioning as well?</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. We've been a big funder. We were the ones who funded this Wolbachia work down in Australia. That was a Gates Grand Challenge back in 2003. We jointly funded the work in Yogyakarta with an Indonesian family foundation who funded that rollout. That has benefited - It doesn't completely get rid of the dengue, but it drops the level pretty dramatically.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: -by about 70 percent.</p><p>Bill Gates: And we have some of our vaccine partners, including Sanofi and Takeda, who've worked on vaccines. We're going to need a next-generation vaccine to completely solve it. The dengue vaccine turns out to be quite challenging, but it is possible. We funded the early development of this mRNA, and so a lot of the new vaccines will be reformulated. And instead of using a needle, which a lot of people don't like, we're just going to have a little patch that you can self-apply. And it doesn't have any pain-or so we hope.</p><p>Whether it's just in general to get higher vaccination rates, or particularly in a pandemic, the fact that you could distribute this thing and just self-apply it rather than going into healthcare would be pretty dramatic. And so there's a lot of lessons coming out of the COVID pandemic that will help us with the current infectious diseases, but also would allow us to deal far, far better when-and sadly, it's not if, it's when-the next big pandemic challenge comes around.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, we work very closely with the Gates team. So, you know, I'm sure dengue will be part of what's going on.</p><p>It sounds like we're asking for it, but it's something that we really go through quite a fair bit in Southeast Asia as well. It'll be great to see the malaria problem maybe broaden into a mosquito challenge for you.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. For some of our diseases-it sounds awful to say this-but we're almost glad there's some cases in rich areas, like dengue in Singapore. I mean, it's a terrible thing to say. But, you know, it means that the priority for doing that-you know, HIV, it's tragic that it's everywhere. But part of the reason a lot of global health things like PEPFAR, Global Fund, they got created because the citizens in the US could see the tragedy of HIV. And when you said, should anyone in the world die just because we don't have the $100 a year to buy these ARV medicines? We managed, at least in that time, to get a strong bipartisan response to that. That's one of the things that's at risk, and we're going to have to re-explain to US politicians why they should stay engaged in that.</p><p>When you have a disease like malaria or malnutrition that's really only in the poor countries, then we really need to get people to come and see it. Of course, here in Singapore, the range of income levels and disease burdens just in the region is quite dramatic. You know- in Papua New Guinea-there's still some significant burdens. And of course, this is a region where we'd love to get rid of both dengue and malaria and have that be an example so the rest of the world can do the same thing.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Indeed. Whatever we ask for through Philanthropy Asia Alliance, we ask not only for Singapore, but we ask for the region-because that's important to us.</p><p>Bill Gates: Fantastic.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: President Tharman, you know we've been following your speeches over the years around philanthropy as well. And really, it was at the inaugural PAS that you talked about the move-the need for that move-from cheque-book philanthropy to catalytic philanthropy. Have you seen philanthropists pick up on that idea?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: I think if you look at our new landscape of philanthropy, including the family offices, there's a generation of philanthropic leaders now who really want to see impact in what they're doing. And that impact is not completely dislodged from looking at financial returns, but they want more than that. They want to see social impact. They want to see a broader impact on the lives of beneficiaries.</p><p>So I think the thinking has shifted. And it's important now to develop the methods that allow us to measure impact so that-to go back to the earlier point-we can put more resources into proven interventions and scale them up.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, when you speak of the shift in generation-and from what we are seeing through some of our efforts throughout the Temasek Trust ecosystem-we find it very interesting that the younger, well, not quite philanthropists, but maybe would-be philanthropists through their own wealth management platforms-they save, they invest.</p><p>Or at least when I was growing up, if I was savvy about my personal finances, I would save well, I would invest well, and that was what my platform was all about. We have found that the wealth platforms of today are including philanthropy in it-the young people whom they are trying to attract onto their apps, their wealth apps-are asking for philanthropy options to be part of it. Because they know to be savvy today in your personal finances is to give as well as to save.</p><p>So that's been an interesting shift that we've seen as well. But how do we get more, Bill, of the young people at least to see their $1 million, their $10,000, or even their $100 as making a difference? Not everyone moves a hundred billion.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. Well, the Gates Foundation is trying to encourage philanthropy, both by people of great wealth-you know, we have a thing called the Giving Pledge that we have about 300 people who've committed to giving away the majority of their wealth during their lifetime or through their will. And so that's kind of a community.</p><p>But we also-you know, there's a day in the United States called Giving Tuesday, where we really talk about help your local teacher, help your local food bank, or help us succeed with polio eradication-where even $10 donations, you know, we say a bed net that protects a child, a vaccine that protects a girl from cervical cancer-that's actually $2 to buy that vaccine.</p><p>In the US, philanthropy is about 2 percent of the economy, so small compared to private sector and government, but globally it's about half a percent. And so the US is a little bit ahead on that. And it's interesting to think, okay, why is that? Is it the tax incentives? That may be part of it. Is it that we know the government can't solve all problems? And so there's this kind of self-reliance, local community groups-that's part of it.</p><p>We'd like to really spread this idea. A very big giving-you know, the most honourable givers are those who are actually making some sacrifice. And of course, when I give, I'm making no sacrifice at all. And so it's very praiseworthy. But helping people know that the money will be well used and they get a sense-I thought in the digital era, philanthropy would take off even more. As yet, we've only seen that in a very modest way.</p><p>And so I still believe we can do it, because we can connect the donor and have them see the outcome. We can't get everybody to go to the site of the actual work. And it's in those poor areas that the impact per dollar is dramatically higher. I'm not saying all philanthropy should be that, but that's-you know, I'm doing that with 90 percent of my resources.</p><p>In the US, about 5 percent of philanthropic giving leaves the country. So a lot of it is domestic, which is just fine.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: I think there's an important opportunity for philanthropy in this part of the world, which is moving beyond traditional charity towards addressing the largest problems that the region faces-and the world faces-through local action. And one of the least noticed large problems has to do with food systems and nutrition.</p><p>It's a looming crisis that isn't focused on very much because it's a slow-burning crisis. We have reached the limits of traditional ways of producing food - both by ordinary smallholder farmers as well as in industrial agriculture. We've reached the limits because it is too large a source of greenhouse gas emissions; we can't keep encroaching into natural forests and other natural ecosystems; and also because soil health has deteriorated very significantly.</p><p>In fact, there's been a step reduction in moisture in the soil over the last 20 years that now makes the land much more susceptible to droughts, much less able to be a sink for carbon, and much less able to grow plants with a reasonable yield. So we have a real challenge in how we grow food in future.</p><p>And on the demand side, we have the reverse. We have an explosion of demand. We have about 1.7 billion people being added to the world's population in the next 25 years. In fact, in the next 10 years, we have about 800 million people. And we have a much larger increase in food and nutrition demand - by some 50-75% over the next 25 years - because a large group of lower-middle-income people aspire to become middle class.</p><p>So food demand is going up. Supply is going to be constrained. We have to revolutionise food systems. We need a new Green Revolution-and a truly green revolution that uses less water, allows more moisture to stay in the soil, involves less methane emissions from rice cultivation especially, and less greenhouse gas emissions in general. And that still gives farmers a better yield.</p><p>And it's possible. One of the initiatives that Philanthropy Asia Alliance has launched is Decarbonising Rice. Using new seed varieties or new strains that are more resistant to droughts and floods. New cultivation techniques that use much less water. There have been large-scale trials now in India and elsewhere that have seen significant improvements in farmers' yields, a 50% reduction in water requirements, and 20-50% percent reductions in methane emissions.</p><p>So this is a large challenge. It involves all of us, because if we don't solve it, many more people in the world are going to go hungry in the years to come, and everyone else is going to see an increase in the cost of living, because food prices are going to go up. So we really need to focus on this - transform how rice is cultivated - in order that farmers can still have good incomes, populations can have good nutrition, including the poor especially, and the cost of living doesn't need to go up over time.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Thank you, President Tharman. Bill, before we go-thank you for opening the office in Singapore. What do you want to see from this region, where innovation and philanthropy are concerned?</p><p>Bill Gates: Well, we're already seeing a lot of great philanthropists here. And I think people are very family-oriented. And so having something even beyond whatever the family business is-having the family philanthropy, getting the family members working together and being proud about what they're able to achieve-I think we're seeing a big increase in that. And so we're excited to be here and learn together.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: We're excited to have you here. Bill Gates, thank you. President Tharman, thank you very much.

A very good afternoon to everyone. Singapore aligns ourselves with the statement delivered by The Honourable Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Prime Minister of Samoa, that was delivered on behalf of AOSIS (Alliance of Small Island States).</p><p>2.Singapore is a tiny city-state, a low-lying island. Thirty percent of our island is less than five metres above sea level. Some of our fellow SIDS (Small Island Developing States) are even more at risk than us. Sea-level rise is therefore a global challenge, a clear and present danger. Cooperation and coordination at the global level is needed, as well as adherence to international law, and all this is essential for an effective response. Singapore fully supports the AOSIS Declaration on Sea-Level Rise and Statehood, which is a concrete step in the right direction. Notwithstanding the physical changes arising from climate change-related sea-level rise, the continued application, without reduction, of our maritime zones generated in accordance with UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), as well as the rights and entitlements that flow from them, is of critical importance to SIDS.</p><p>3. Singapore has also been taking action to address the threats posed to us by sea-level rise. Let me just share two approaches.</p><p>4. First, coastal adaptation measures. Singapore has constructed seawalls and stone embankments covering 70 to 80 percent of our coastline in order to mitigate coastal erosion. We have launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute at the National University of Singapore to encourage further innovative solutions for coastal protection.</p><p>5. Second, we are trying to enlist nature to address sea-level rise. One example of this is the planting of mangroves and seagrasses that we believe act as natural barriers. Mangroves can reduce wave heights by up to 66 percent. This strengthens Singapore's coastal resilience and also restores ecosystems.</p><p>6. We are happy to share our experiences with other states.

INTRODUCTION</p><p>A1. Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their questions and suggestions.</p><p>A2. The points made cover three key themes:</p><p>a. First, enhancing our pro-enterprise environment. I will cover how MOF agencies are simplifying rules for businesses. SPS Shawn Huang will address improving the experience of transacting with the Government and making government procurement more accessible.</p><p>b. Second, ensuring responsible, effective and efficient use of our public resources. I will speak on this.</p><p>c. Third, preparing for Singapore to meet intensifying long-term challenges, particularly climate change, and strengthening our social compact for a caring and inclusive society. Minister Indranee will cover these.</p><p>B. SIMPLIFYING RULES AND REDUCING COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR BUSINESSES</p><p>B1. Mr Chairman, Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked what MOF agencies are doing to simplify rules for a more pro-business environment.</p><p>B2. Rules and regulations exist for several reasons - from safeguarding people, property and the environment, to ensuring good governance and accountability. The Government has to strike a balance between these important objectives, and the need to encourage enterprise and innovation. Therefore, Singapore's approach has been to enact practical rules and review them regularly to streamline and remove outdated ones.</p><p>B3. The Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, led by DPM Gan, was formed in April 2024 to further enhance regulatory efficiency and reduce compliance costs for businesses.</p><p>B4. Let me share some examples of what MOF agencies are doing to support this important area of work.</p><p>B5. First, IRAS will extend the grace period for businesses to begin charging GST, from one month to two months.</p><p>a. Currently, businesses expecting to cross the $1 million taxable turnover threshold within the next 12 months must register for and start charging GST within a month of forecast. This timeline can be tight for some SMEs.</p><p>b. The change will give SMEs more time to prepare. It will take effect from 1 July 2025, and benefit 1,500 businesses every year.</p><p>B6. Second, IRAS will progressively expand the requirement for intermediaries to pre-fill income information on behalf of self-employed persons, or SEPs for short.</p><p>a. About 87% of individual taxpayers today benefit from pre-filled income information by their employers and intermediaries for their income tax filing. However, many SEPs do not enjoy this convenience.</p><p>b. The intermediaries that engage the services of SEPs already have the income information of the SEPs, and are in a good position to provide this. It is more efficient for them to do so, than to have the individual SEPs fill in the information in their respective tax returns.</p><p>c. We started by requiring commission-paying intermediaries, such as real estate agencies and insurance providers, to submit income information for their agents and this has benefitted over 100,000 self-employed commission agents.</p><p>d. IRAS plans to bring more intermediaries on board, and has been encouraging and engaging private hire car and taxi operators, as well as the delivery platforms. I urge these intermediaries to come on board as soon as possible.</p><p>B7. We have also been simplifying rules where we can.</p><p>a. One example is the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio, or FEDR, which allows qualifying businesses the option of claiming their tax deductions for business expenses based on a prescribed percentage of their gross income earned. This is simpler and more convenient compared to using actual allowable business expenses.</p><p>b. The FEDR was first introduced in Year of Assessment 2019 for private-hire car and taxi drivers, and subsequently extended to commission agents and delivery workers. The utilisation has been high, which shows that this is a good option for many of our workers.</p><p>c. We will be consulting stakeholders on how the FEDR can be expanded to support more small businesses and self-employed persons.</p><p>B8. We are reducing and removing regulations where possible.</p><p>a. IRAS will drop the requirement for second-hand goods dealers to seek approval before using the GST Gross Margin Scheme.</p><p>b. The scheme allows second-hand goods dealers to charge GST on the gross margin of the sale, rather than the full sale price. This is because GST is often priced into the base cost from earlier transactions.</p><p>c. As most dealers are generally compliant with the scheme's requirements, IRAS will remove the need for them to obtain approval, starting from 1 July this year.</p><p>d. This will streamline the compliance process, particularly for new or smaller second-hand goods dealers.</p><p>B9. Sir, ACRA is also actively streamlining processes for companies.</p><p>a. There is a requirement today for companies to disclose their directors' interest in shares or debentures in the director's statement.</p><p>b. Over the years, ACRA has received an increasing number of requests from companies to be exempted from this requirement. In cases where all the company shareholders agree, ACRA will grant these exemption requests.</p><p>c. ACRA has recently streamlined this process such that non-listed companies do not need to seek exemption, as long as consent from all shareholders is sought. This will reduce administrative burden and save companies $200 in application fees and we expect around 1,500 companies to benefit every year.</p><p>d. Information of the company's shareholding will remain publicly accessible and this maintains corporate transparency.</p><p>B10. These are part of the ongoing efforts to improve our rules and processes. In the interest of time, I am not able to share the full range but this is an ongoing work. We will continue to engage businesses, and also our frontline officers and colleagues, and solicit their ideas to jointly improve our regulatory landscape.<br/><br/>B11. This approach is also in line with the spirit of Forward Singapore. It reinforces in our agencies the importance of working with citizens and businesses, while taking on board their feedback to continually improve our policies, rules and processes.</p><p>C. RESPONSIBLE, EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES</p><p>C1. Our government spending over this term has delivered good outcomes for Singapore as detailed in the biennial Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review Reports.</p><p>SPENDING EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY</p><p>C2. We are continually looking at how we can transform and improve the way we operate.</p><p>C3. Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about resource reviews and improving budget efficiency. Our budgeting framework is designed with efficiency in mind:</p><p>a. We regularly review the block budgets for Ministries.</p><p>b. MOF also applies controls to spending and manpower growth to drive agency transformation and yield savings, which are returned to MOF for central reallocation towards emerging priorities.</p><p>C4. I agree with Mr Saktiandi that it is important to have strong collaboration and coordination across Ministries. MOF actively encourages coordinated service delivery, where there are synergies.</p><p>a. For example, we saved $2 billion and 44 hectares of land with the 4-in-1 East Coast Integrated Depot, which combines three MRT depots and one bus depot.</p><p>b. The ServiceSG Centres are another example. They offer residents one-stop access to about 600 Government services from over 25 agencies. Citizen satisfaction across ServiceSG Centres was consistently above 90 percent for the last three years.</p><p>C5. Resourcing levers can be used to drive transformation on a whole-of-Government basis. We use joint budgets for issues that straddle multiple agencies, to streamline efforts, check against resource duplication, and enhance accountability for shared outcomes.</p><p>C6. We also created the WOG Public Service Transformation Budget in 2022. This provides agencies seed funding to pilot innovative and transformative ideas, if the proposals involve inter-agency collaboration.</p><p>C7. I thank Mr Edward Chia for his suggestion on tracking the time taken from policy ideation to implementation. Sir, the timelines vary across projects, depending on factors such as their complexity and the resources required. We will continue to deliver our projects in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p><p>C8. We regularly review our internal processes to improve efficiencies. For instance, we shortened the Gateway evaluation for large development projects to speed up the approval process. Mr Liang highlighted the need to continually enhance effectiveness and governance. This is supported by programme evaluation, which helps us to understand whether a programme is achieving its objectives, and whether improvements are needed.</p><p>C9. I want to be quite clear that these are processes that we have in place, and these are efforts that we will continue to improve. But as PM reminds us, it does not mean that we are perfect today. There is room for improvement and we will work hard to make those continuous improvements. This is something we will continue to do.</p><p>GST-EXCLUSIVE PRICING BY HOTEL AND F&amp;B ESTABLISHMENTS</p><p>C10. Mr Louis Chua asked about the concession for hotel and F&amp;B establishments that impose a service charge to display GST-exclusive prices.</p><p>a. This concession was granted in 1994, based on industry feedback that it would be costly and operationally challenging to maintain and display separate price lists for take-away items and dine-in items as service charge would be imposed only on the latter.</p><p>b. The concession is to help reduce business costs. But clarity for consumers is also important, and businesses that rely on this concession must display a prominent statement informing consumers that prices shown are subject to service charge and GST.</p><p>c. This practice has now been in place for three decades and we last reviewed it in 2022. I do not think most consumers would be confused, as Mr Chua claimed. Conversely, removing the concession may lead to more confusion, and also increase costs for businesses as they would now need to print multiple sets of menus and price lists.</p><p>FISCAL MANAGEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE WAGE CREDIT SCHEME</p><p>C11. Ms He Ting Ru asked about the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (or PWCS). This is a scheme that we have put in place. It is currently due to cease in 2026. We will review closer to the date, whether to continue or to stop, bearing in mind the economic conditions at that time, because we are in a more uncertain global environment.</p><p>C12. The PWCS is not a broad-based subsidy for all companies. To get PWCS, the employer has to pay their lower-wage workers a wage increase, then they can qualify for co-funding from Government.</p><p>C13. So the purpose is for the government to co-fund and share some of the costs of helping our lower-wage workers to earn a higher income. Because we want employers to pay the lower-wage workers a higher salary, we share with employers part of this cost of paying the lower-wage workers a higher salary. This is an important part of our social compact, which I think Ms He will agree.</p><p>C14. I do not think Ms He is suggesting that we should stop providing support for employers, especially our SMEs. This is not in lieu of other schemes we have in place to improve productivity. In fact, this is something that we put in place specifically to help employers to be able to share some of the costs where they are paying their lower-wage workers a higher salary.</p><p>C15. On productivity, we have many other schemes that we will continue to work, through our Trade Association Chambers, industry associations, companies, as well as the labour movement, through the Company Training Committees (CTCs), to help companies to improve productivity. Because I agree with Ms He that for the wage increases to be sustainable, it must go together with productivity improvements.</p><p>I just made an observation here that what Ms He is saying seems to be a little bit different from what Associate Professor Jamus Lim said during the Budget debate. If I heard him correctly, he suggested that wage increases can happen with or without productivity improvements. But I agree with Ms He's point that the two over time need to move in tandem. It is more sustainable.</p><p>SOUND FISCAL AND RESERVES POLICIES</p><p>C16. Chairman, Mr Liang spoke about responsible management of our fiscal resources and reserves. Mr Saktiandi asked how the Government ensures fiscal prudence and responsibility.</p><p>C17. Sir, as PM mentioned, our current fiscal position is healthy. We have spent within our means and planned ahead for structural spending needs, like rising healthcare expenditure and climate adaptation.</p><p>a. This allows the Government to follow through on our commitments, without borrowing or using more of our reserves for immediate needs and recurrent spending.</p><p>b. This fiscal discipline of maintaining a balanced budget has worked well for Singapore, and we must strive to sustain this.</p><p>C18. Our reserves, which have been carefully managed over generations, are another source of strength and national resilience, especially during a crisis.</p><p>a. During the Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, our reserves protected Singaporeans and placed us in a better position than many other countries. We were able to use our reserves for public health, social and economic support measures that saved lives and livelihoods, and enabled Singapore to bounce back and emerge stronger.</p><p>b. Our Past Reserves also generate a sustainable and steady stream of income that goes into our budget every year. The Net Investment Returns Contribution now accounts for about a fifth of annual government revenue.</p><p>C19. Mr Louis Chua spoke about the importance of transparency, accountability and governance of our investment entities.</p><p>C20. Sir, we have discussed and explained this many times. There are structures and processes in place to ensure that our investment entities, GIC and Temasek, are good stewards of our reserves for the benefit of all Singaporeans.</p><p>C21. On governance, the Government ensures that each entity has a competent Board in place to oversee its Management. The Government holds the Board accountable for instilling good corporate governance and achieving good long-term returns according to its mandate.</p><p>C22. At the same time, the Government does not direct or influence the investment decisions of our investment entities. This segregation of roles allows our investment entities to invest professionally with a long-term orientation. That is why during the MAS COS earlier, Mr Chua also acknowledged that it would not be a good idea for the Government to require GIC to invest part of its portfolio in the local equities market.</p><p>C23. On transparency, we have put out a lot of information on our reserves. Temasek's net portfolio value and MAS' official foreign reserves are public information. All our entities publish information on their portfolio returns. We have also published information on our reserves management framework and governance on the MOF website.</p><p>C24. On performance, the Government does not look at one single parameter. Neither do we focus only on short-term performance. Instead, we assess our entities based on their mandates and performance over the long term, and consider factors such as diversification of portfolio and risk-adjusted returns, which measure investment returns relative to the risk taken.</p><p>C25. Our investment entities have performed creditably over the long term. Given the increase in market volatility in recent years, some variation from market indices is to be expected. What is key is that our entities continue to navigate the uncertainty while maintaining a disciplined, long-term approach to generating sustainable returns.</p><p>C26. Stewardship and accountability are key principles we abide by when managing the reserves. We have benefitted from the careful work of previous generations. This Government believes that we must continue to maintain the same fiscal discipline and provide a strong financial foundation for both current and future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>[Category: Investment Banking &amp; Brokerage, Financial/ Capital Market, Regulatory and Legal, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Finance,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["C17.

Good morning. I am delighted to speak once again at this Forum.</p><p>2. Accelerating sustainable development and climate action is urgent. If recent climate projections are anything to go by, we will experience more extreme weather events. There is a need to both mitigate climate change and adapt to climate change. SingCham is bringing the adaptation imperative to the fore this year by focusing on \"Building Our Resilient Future: Innovations for Sustainable Living\".</p><p>3. The partnership between the government, private and people sectors is indispensable in tackling this challenge head on. Governments are the vanguard of long-term policy planning, companies are the forerunners of innovation, and people are the source of ideas. All three sectors require and complement each other to mount robust responses to challenges and seize opportunities. Let me share some examples.</p><p>4. Without each other, the Suzhou Industrial Park, Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City and the Sino-Singapore Nanjing Eco Hi-Tech Island would not have materialised. These beacons of sustainable industrial and urban development were outcomes of government vision and facilitation, industry innovation and investment, and government-industry collaboration and integration.</p><p>5. Second, as evidenced by the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Further Upgrade Protocol, we are enhancing our bilateral economic ties whilst recognising the importance of sustainable development. I encourage enterprises to leverage the opportunities created by the CSFTA to engage in substantive and mutually beneficial cooperation.</p><p>6. And third, the Singapore-China Youth Interns Exchange Scheme. The cultural similarities between Singapore and China have allowed the platform to serve as a safe space for the cross-fertilisation of ideas among talented youth for innovative and out-of-the-box solutions.</p><p>7. But the partnership between the government and private sector is not naturally harmonious and should not be taken for granted. Governments are inclined to regulate and are subject to political imperatives; while industries desire certainty and to maximise commercial outcomes. The imposition of tariffs on environmental goods and services such as EVs, as well as the supposed use of sustainability standards to determine market access in some parts of the world is an example.

Good morning. I am very happy to join you today for the inaugural Coastal and Flood Resilience Leaders Summit, held in conjunction with the Singapore International Water Week 2024.<br/><br/>2. Water is an integral part of the planetary ecosystem. It supports lives and nurtures the food chains that feed humanity.</p><p>Mismanagement of our water ecosystem contributes to climate change such as over-drawing of water, lowering of water table, which has resulted in higher risk of forest fires. And in return, climate change unleashes extraordinary power through typhoons that destroy properties and lives. While mitigation will always be a priority in climate action, we have to deal with the impacts of climate change now.</p><p>Adaptation to a warmer planet, with greater unpredictability of the weather system, and changing rainfall patterns is a present-day priority. Policy makers have to consider a wide range of water-related issues in an integrated way - by incorporating decisions such as water security and allocation of water; water safety and protection of water sources; flood mitigation and coastal protection.<br/><br/>3. It is thus timely that we now include climate adaptation as one of the key pillars of the Singapore International Water Week. By pooling together the expertise and experiences of global stakeholders, this long-standing platform provides an ideal opportunity for all of us to jointly develop best practices that will strengthen our cities and communities against climate change threats.<br/><br/>Singapore's Experience in Climate Adaptation<br/><br/>4. Singapore is susceptible to the effects of sea level rise.</p><p>Around 30 per cent of our island is less than 5 metres above mean sea level and potentially affected by the combined impact of rising sea levels, storm surges and high tides. Enhancing coastal and flood resilience is a complex endeavour that requires new capabilities and skillsets and coordinated planning and implementation.<br/><br/>5. In 2020, we appointed PUB as our national coastal protection agency to address both coastal and inland flood risks holistically. PUB is tasked to develop a set of comprehensive strategies to enhance Singapore's flood resilience against both sea level rise and extreme rain events. An example of how flood resilience and coastal protection are considered in an integrated and holistic manner is the Marina Barrage. This flood control infrastructure involves the use of crest gates and pumps to regulate the water levels of the Marina Bay in times of heavy rain to reduce the risk of flooding, while serving its water supply function. It has also become an icon of the city landscape, and a popular destination for recreational activities. Another exciting project ahead of us is the Long Island proposal. This is a proposed solution for coastal and flood protection for a stretch of over 10km of coastline, with twelve outlet drains discharging stormwater from inland for flood resilience, while concurrently incorporating coastal protection function. At the same time, it has the potential of creating more land to meet future development needs with new recreational opportunities for the East Coast.<br/><br/>6. While we are in our early stage of building coastal protection, we have done a few things.</p><p>First, since 2021, we have demarcated our entire coastline into eight parts and begun site-specific studies progressively. These studies seek to develop and explore the feasibility of various coastal protection measures, taking into account site characteristics, opportunities, and constraints. The Long Island project was one such outcome.</p><p>Second, we are going through legislative changes to clarify and delineate the roles and responsibilities for coastal protection. As the site-specific studies progress, we will need this clarity to implement the required coastal protection measures across our coastline as multiple land owners and stakeholders are involved.</p><p>Third, we are building our knowledge in understanding and addressing flood risks. We have launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme in March last year with a funding support of S$125 million, or about USD$90 million. Under this programme, we will house our Centre of Excellence, named the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI) Singapore. For the first tranche of research projects, the Centre has initiated nine projects in areas such as innovative engineering, hybrid solutions, and understanding of local coastal processes. CFI Singapore and its partners are training more than eighty undergraduate and graduate students as well as working professionals to provide a strong pipeline of talent in the field of coastal protection. To learn more about the nine projects, I encourage you to visit CFI Singapore's booth at the Level 1 Expo.</p><p>Here, I am pleased to announce that CFI Singapore will be starting on eight more research projects, ranging from understanding coastal science processes to improved modelling methods. For example, a new project by Nanyang Technological University aims to design barriers made from jute, a composite of plant fibre and calcium waste. These barriers could function as submerged beach berms to reduce wave energy and promote soil accumulation, thus serving as a potential eco-friendly measure to enhance coastal resilience.</p><p>I am also pleased to share that PUB has launched an applied research grant call in May. The grant call considers five topics: sustainable materials, smart structural health monitoring, decision making for adaptive planning, innovative solutions, and sensors for sediment transport.</p><p>Fourth, we are building capacity and capability in our industry, engineering services in particular, to deliver future coastal protection measures. One such effort is a new Code of Practice for Coastal Protection, which will establish common standards for design, operation, and maintenance, to guide the industry in implementing effective measures.</p><p>To enable closer partnership between the public and private sectors, I am pleased to announce that the Singapore Water Association will be launching a new Coastal Protection Chapter. With this new Chapter, we aim to establish a three-way intermediary between the industry, institutes of higher learning, and government agencies. The Singapore Water Association will be signing a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the CFI Singapore and the Forum for Climate Change Adaptation, FCCA. The FCCA is a ground-up initiative to bring professionals, practitioners, and researchers together to share, collaborate, and co-create solutions for climate change adaptation. With the MOU, we envision closer collaboration amongst stakeholders through knowledge sharing sessions, post-graduate courses, as well as innovation and translation efforts.</p><p>Call for International Collaboration</p><p>7. As we seek to address our common challenge of coastal and flood risks, there is clearly potential for cross-border partnerships and knowledge exchange. Demand for innovative and cost-effective solutions and expertise will grow, and along with it, the opportunities and prospects for business.<br/><br/>8. Singapore is committed to international climate action, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Seventh Assessment Report, AR7. Singapore will be supporting the IPCC Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, which is co-chaired by Professor Winston Chow. We will be hosting the Technical Support Unit at the Singapore Management University, which will further global understanding of the importance of adaptation.<br/><br/>9. Singapore is also keen to contribute to the understanding of changing climate in South East Asia.

But details on how this could be achieved remain unfinished.</p><p> Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries -- which are historically responsible for the bulk of global emissions -- are obligated to provide climate finance to developing countries as they often bear the brunt of the worst impacts of climate change despite contributing the least emissions. </p><p> The huge shortfall, coupled with unfinished details on how the rest of the money is to be mobilised, leaves emerging markets -- many of which are in Asia -- facing the daunting task of having to undertake system-wide energy transition efforts, implement climate adaptation projects and cope with natural disasters, all on a tight budget. </p><p> Getting things movingBefore the finalisation of these details though, Singapore already got things moving with the launch of a blended finance initiative -- known as the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (Fast-P) -- at COP28 last year. </p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been making a push to scale up blended finance transactions over the last few years as emerging markets in Asia typically are fiscally constrained, and have limited access to private capital. </p><p> To this end, the country announced at COP29 -- one year after Fast-P was launched -- that it will provide up to US$500 million as concessional capital to the initiative, by matching every dollar of concessional capital committed by other partners also involved.</p><p> It was a very strategic move considering that the tiny but very rich nation-state has been facing pressure by other developed countries to be a donor country to the climate finance fund. Singapore does not have a mandatory obligation to provide climate finance under the Paris Agreement, as it is treated as a developing country in international negotiations. </p><p> The idea is for Fast-P to build up concessional capital of US$1 billion in total -- if other partners can match Singapore's commitment -- and then utilise this pool to crowd in up to US$4 billion of commercial capital. </p><p> This brings the total amount that could be potentially mobilised to US$5 billion, which is the target Fast-P aimed to reach when it was first announced one year ago. </p><p> A step forwardThis move, which has been commended by industry observers, is definitely a step forward in mobilising the capital this region needs for climate action. </p><p> The hope is that this initiative may help de-risk climate projects in Asia, and encourage more private-sector participation. Businesses in the region can develop a pipeline of investable projects, which can then be vetted to ensure it meets environmental and financial standards to increase confidence among private investors. </p><p> Blended finance is not new. It has historically been used in the development finance and impact finance sectors, but such transactions are often bespoke and complex, hindering its scalability. </p><p> The approach adopted by MAS aims to overcome some of these challenges. Instead of structuring such transactions on a project-by-project basis, Fast-P seeks to build three different portfolios -- with different investment focuses -- through this pool of money before it gets deployed to multiple projects. </p><p> By designing blended finance mechanisms in such a manner, various sources of capital can help to achieve a diversity of risk and returns. It also helps to scale such transactions as investors would not have to renegotiate the terms of how their capital is to be blended for every individual project. </p><p> However, blended finance is not a silver bullet to solve the climate financing gap in emerging Asia. </p><p> Even for blended finance initiatives such as Fast-P that try to break away from convention, there is still a lot of time spent trying to meet the different investment mandates, risk appetites and time horizons of various stakeholders. </p><p> Multi-development banks may have a long time horizon, but private investors typically have a shorter timeframe of about 10 years, beyond which they expect to be able to recycle their capital. Governments are committed for the duration that the assets being invested in will remain on their territory. </p><p> The attributes of climate-related projects are also very different from one another, though Fast-P has sought to mitigate this by differentiating them into three pillars. One is focused on green investments, the second is on energy transition including the early closure of coal plants, and the third is on hard-to-abate sectors, recently launched at COP29. </p><p> Bridging these differences and carving out a portfolio that satisfies the different needs of each investor require a lot of negotiation, and all these take time. </p><p> Even after these get sorted, there is also no guarantee that there is a ready pipeline of investable projects. </p><p> Ultimately, the right enabling environment through policy support is the crux that will drive private capital into climate-focused investments in emerging Asia. </p><p> Central to the theme of blended finance is the use of concessional capital to mitigate risks for private capital. Policy can achieve the same outcome, and may even be able to do so more efficiently. </p><p> When projects are commercially viable on their own -- whether through the setting of a carbon price or the development of robust institutional frameworks -- private investors will naturally seek them out. </p><p> Once that has been achieved, there may no longer be a real need for blended finance. </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["But details on how this could be achieved remain unfinished.

The Nov 22 proposal on the goal did not explicitly mention grants. </p><p> Nov 22 is officially the last day of the summit, but the conference is expected to overrun. </p><p>Malaysia, echoing the sentiment of many developing countries and climate activists, called for the thrust of the funding to be grants-based, with private finance comprising a fraction of the coffer. </p><p> \"There should also be more grants as opposed to loans. The unfair financial architecture globally has penalised a lot of the poorer countries, and they are loading these countries with debt which is not sustainable,\" said Mr Nik Nazmi. </p><p> \"So, to expect these countries to then carry more debt to deal with climate change, I think it is a bit unrealistic and unfair. And we know that a lot of the developed countries have achieved their level of development and standard of living on the back of climate injustice by using fossil fuels, some of them even from the developing world.\"</p><p> According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 69 per cent of public financing from developed countries in 2022 came in the form of loans. </p><p> Mr Nik Nazmi is expecting climate finance to be easily accessible to developing nations, without hurdles in accessing it. </p><p> \"We are worried the funds would be difficult to access in terms of procedures and very stringent eligibility criteria. Our hope is for transparent modality and that (it) can reduce bureaucratic hurdles,\" he said. </p><p> To develop its national adaptation plan, Malaysia has received funding from the Green Climate Fund -- currently the UN's main funding arm for disbursing climate finance. </p><p> The fund disburses up to US$3 million to help a developing country plan its climate adaptation measures. </p><p> What is more crucial is the funding required to implement the adaptation measures, he noted. </p><p> \"If flood risks are properly calculated, then you could even take out insurance for it. But how do you make it insurable'\" </p><p>Malaysia has experienced a fourfold increase in heatwaves since the 1960s. </p><p> Besides heat-related illnesses and bush fires, another hazard of rising temperatures which emerged recently is drowning.</p><p> The Star reported in August that there were about 20 drowning cases every month in 2024 as more people take a dip in rivers and other water bodies to cool down in the heat. </p><p> The climate finance coffer will help developing countries afford to put in place measures to slash greenhouse gas emissions -- such as carbon capture technologies or building renewable plants -- thus allowing them to set more ambitious climate targets. </p><p>Malaysia wants to retire its coal-fired power plants earlier to meet its target of phasing out the pollutive power source by 2044. South-east Asia has about 2,000 coal plants that are less than 15 years old on average. </p><p> Mr Nik Nazmi said: \"When you have 20 years more for the power plant, then it gets quite expensive to compensate the power producers (when the plants are retired earlier).\" </p><p> Financing the early retirement of coal plants is challenging. </p><p>Singapore is looking into a new type of carbon credit -- called transition credits -- to enable such early phase-out in the region. </p><p> Each credit would represent one tonne of planet-warming emissions that are prevented from being released. </p><p> When asked to assess Asean's presence at COP29, which is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, Mr Nik Nazmi said member countries have begun discussing common positions to take at climate change talks, and he hopes this cooperation will be more apparent at the 2025 conference in Brazil. </p><p> \"Asean is one of the most threatened areas with regard to climate change.

The authors highlighted three key economic impacts of heatwaves: lower agricultural output, diminished labour productivity, and greater occurrences of power outages, which can cause major disruptions to industries and hit a country's energy security.</p><p> These impacts have been especially pronounced over the past year due to the El Nino climate pattern -- which brings warmer conditions to the Pacific Ocean -- as well as the effects of climate change.The resulting heatwaves have had serious effects on Asian agriculture. In Japan, the 2023 heatwave caused quality issues with rice, leading to a shortage. In Vietnam, the heatwave earlier this year affected Robusta coffee production, causing bean prices to hit new highs.</p><p>  Food price inflation may have a spillover effect on core inflation by influencing expectations of consumers and businesses, the HSBC report noted. </p><p> Diminished labour productivity is another major economic impact of heatwaves. By 2030, more than 2 per cent of total working hours worldwide could be lost every year amid higher temperatures, according to a report by the International Labour Organization. In South Asia alone, under the scenario that global temperatures rise 1.5 deg C by the end of the century, heat stress would lead to a loss of 5.3 per cent of working hours in 2030, said the HSBC report. This corresponds to 43 million full-time jobs.</p><p> Energy security is yet another key issue, with countries facing grid overloads and power outages amid extreme heat.

This is where it becomes crucial for policymakers to maintain a long-term perspective on climate resilience to minimise such knee-jerk reactions, while continuing to invest in the transition towards renewable energy. </p><p> For now, Asia is enjoying some respite from heat since the end of El Nino.

It has prompted shifts in behaviour, and inspired concerted action. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Governments worldwide are enacting regulatory measures, such as carbon taxes, subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), and plans for green infrastructure development. Businesses are committing to net-zero emissions, setting science-based targets, and encouraging their supply chains to adopt more sustainable practices. Consumers increasingly favour sustainable products, and are altering their spending patterns accordingly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Meanwhile, some investors are advocating for action, heightening their focus on climate-related risks and setting minimum climate standards, which in turn influences portfolio allocations.</p><p> Although these transformations pose risks to asset prices, we recognise that they also herald a unique investment opportunity for our generation. </p><p> We advocate for a climate strategy that yields both environmental and financial returns, moving beyond traditional approaches. Generally, strategies focused solely on low emissions often rely on historical data without adequately accounting for shifts in business models or the tangible impacts on the environment. </p><p> Similarly, while green bond strategies contribute to funding eco-friendly projects, a strategy exclusively centred on green bonds may suffer from limited diversification, lower yield return and extended durations.</p><p> Such traditional methodologies do not sufficiently address the physical consequences of climate change, nor do they focus adequately on adaptation. Current policies place us on a trajectory towards a 2.4 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures, a scenario corroborated by our climate analysis. This warming path is likely to exacerbate weather volatility and temperature extremes, affecting both society at large and asset values.</p><p> Crafting a solutionAt the heart of a favourable solution is the conviction that climate outcomes should prioritise real-world emissions reduction, support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and facilitate adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change. Every investment decision should be made through a climate lens, necessitating a bespoke framework. This approach, coupled with a global opportunity set and a strategy focused on best ideas, is designed to yield compelling returns and income.</p><p> Climate transition in Asia will likely be core to the outcomes that are achieved on a global level considering the size of Asia's population, projected economic growth, exposure to higher emitting industries, and the opportunity to potentially leapfrog high-emitting technologies and adopt low-carbon solutions. Asian companies are often national, regional or even global leaders in their respective industries, which could translate to meaningful impact when they adopt more sustainable trajectories. </p><p> Covering the global universe, the strategy centres on identifying and investing in ambitious companies that are leading the charge in their respective industries. These trailblazers are making significant strides in real-world decarbonisation, disrupting traditional business models, pioneering innovative technologies, and responding proactively to evolving consumer demands. By aligning with such leaders, investors may capitalise on the growth of the climate market and achieve superior performance.</p><p> Three types of companies are worth a look -- those in high-emitting sectors that are setting the standard for emissions reduction; innovators who are developing the technologies and products essential for decarbonisation efforts; and entities that help societies adjust to the impacts of climate change and contribute to global climate resilience. </p><p> By carefully selecting companies that align with these themes, investors may seize a significant growth opportunity and contribute meaningfully to the efforts against climate change.</p><p> Fixed income instruments, including green and municipal bonds, are pivotal in channelling funds towards projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience. A comprehensive fixed income strategy should span various segments -- investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging market debt. </p><p> An additional nuance within the Asian bond universe is the presence of large state-owned enterprises that are focused on delivering policy objectives instead of solely profit, allowing bond investors the opportunity to lend to issuers that are involved in national infrastructure projects that are part of the government's strategy to move towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p> We currently see the opportunities in Asia in the renewable energy space, EVs and its corresponding value chain, as well as large corporates that are adopting more sustainable ways of manufacturing their products. </p><p> We expect the potential pipeline from Asia to continue to grow, and could span a wide variety of opportunities including low carbon materials production and climate adaptation.</p><p> Selecting the right theme is merely the beginning. Active company selection becomes crucial in ensuring that investments genuinely enhance the portfolio's value. </p><p> For credit investors, the application of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards across all issuers requires careful consideration, especially given the disparities between high-yield and investment-grade issuers. High-yield issuers -- often smaller or newer companies -- may not have the luxury of dedicated ESG teams, established green-bond frameworks, or the capacity to generate comprehensive sustainability reports. Consequently, companies genuinely committed to sustainability might be overlooked due to their inability to showcase their ESG credentials prominently.</p><p> A recent example is Ardagh Metal Packaging, a US-listed global producer of infinitely recyclable metal drinks cans. Until recently, this company lagged in ESG disclosures despite its strong alignment with sustainability, particularly within the circular economy and waste reduction sectors. In 2022, its recycling initiatives were estimated to have avoided 3.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions compared to using virgin materials.</p><p> This case highlights that ESG assessment should transcend mere box-ticking; there is no substitute for thorough research. Investors adept at identifying firms with commendable ESG practices, albeit with limited disclosure, stand to gain by investing ahead of the curve, before enhanced transparency garners wider market recognition. </p><p> A promising landscapeThe future of climate change investing looks bright, buoyed by the escalating global emphasis on environmental sustainability. Despite concerns, we maintain that the burgeoning demand for climate-related investments will not alone lead to overvaluation. The arena of climate transition presents a vast and perpetually evolving landscape of opportunities, far from being exhausted by current interest levels.</p><p> Most importantly, we believe a climate change investment strategy should have a dual objective -- achieving meaningful climate impact alongside robust financial returns. This approach transcends mere trend-following. It is about pinpointing and supporting innovative companies that lead the charge in industry transformation and real-world decarbonisation efforts. </p><p> This strategy opens the door to a wide spectrum of opportunities, enabling investors to engage with ventures that are not just promising in terms of returns but are also pivotal in the global transition to a more sustainable future.</p><p> It is imperative to curate a well-balanced portfolio encompassing leaders in emissions reduction, innovators in technology, and contributors to climate adaptation.

But now, it's time for it to do more to fund itself, through its own bank.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Since the 1960s, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan, the European Union and, more recently, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and China have poured resources into Asean economies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hundreds of billions of dollars have gone towards building infrastructure, revitalising agriculture, health and education programmes, climate change adaptation and mitigation, promoting financial inclusion and other goals. This has made a difference. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Combined with their own domestic resources, external inflows have enabled most Asean economies to transition from low-income to middle-income status within a generation.</p><p> But the development challenges remain, their costs have soared and the gap between the resources needed and those available has widened.</p><p> Needs far exceed  available resourcesIn a 2022 study, the Sydney-based Lowy Institute estimated that 11 South-east Asian nations -- which include all of the Asean members and Timor-Leste -- received about US$200 billion (S$265 billion) in official development finance between 2015 and 2021, or an average of around US$28 billion per year, in a mix of grants and concessional and non-concessional loans, of which China was the biggest contributor, providing US$5.5 billion a year.</p><p> But Asean's financing needs are multiple times greater than what it receives. For example, the Asean Secretariat and UN Trade and Development estimate that Asean needs about US$210 billion per year for infrastructure investment alone. </p><p> Given that Asean countries are among the most vulnerable in the world to climate change disruptions, the Global Commission on Adaptation suggests that they need to invest at least US$50 billion a year to build resilience against climate impacts. </p><p> The UN Development Programme figures that Asean needs another US$100 billion to US$150 billion a year in social investments, especially in health and education, to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality.</p><p> To meet its financing needs, Asean will need to mobilise resources from public, private and international sources, and to deploy them effectively across various sectors.</p><p> Public and international sources will need to provide most of the financing, at least for infrastructure, climate adaptation, health and education, most of which involve investments that are not commercially viable.</p><p> Every Asean country runs fiscal deficits, so public finances in the region are already stretched. </p><p> Countries are limited in their abilities to fund their development on their own, but they would benefit from a collective financing pool.</p><p> There are many external sources of finance available, but even all taken together cannot fulfil Asean's needs. </p><p> The multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, the ADB and the AIIB, have several other clients to serve. </p><p> For example, the ADB has 68 members, the majority of which are outside South-east Asia. </p><p> It has done good work in several areas across the region for decades, but its resources are spread thin. According to its annual report, its total financial commitments in 2023 amounted to US$23.6 billion, of which about two-thirds went outside South-east Asia. </p><p> The AIIB has 109 members, 48 of which are outside Asia and include countries in Europe, Africa and Latin America. Its biggest borrower is India. </p><p> The voting power of Asean members in these institutions is also small -- about 14 per cent in ADB and 8 per cent in AIIB. </p><p> So, as much as Asean benefits from the financing that these institutions provide, it may not get approval for many of the projects that it needs.</p><p> Question marks around future funding from ChinaAlthough China has been the single largest source of development finance, what is notable is that its contribution has fallen in recent years. </p><p> The Lowy Institute study points out that whereas in 2015, China provided around 24 per cent of South-east Asia's overseas development finance, by 2021, its share had fallen to 14 per cent. </p><p> This partly reflects China's economic slowdown after the Covid-19 pandemic, the sluggish progress on some big infrastructure projects such as the East Coast Rail Link in Malaysia and the high-speed rail project in Thailand, as well as greater caution among Chinese state banks in disbursing loans. </p><p> Amid China's continuing economic slowdown and pressing domestic needs, it is doubtful whether China will be able to provide development finance to Asean on the same scale as 10 years ago. </p><p> Moreover, whatever finance it does provide will be guided by China's economic and strategic priorities, which may not always align with those of Asean.</p><p> This further strengthens the case for Asean to create its own development bank, which could be called the Asean Bank for Development. </p><p> Many economic sub-regions and groupings have their own development banks that supplement the work of multilateral lending agencies. </p><p> Europe has the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as well as the European Investment Bank. Brics members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and others) have the New Development Bank -- although its membership extends beyond Brics. </p><p> The Eurasian Development Bank, headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, invests in the development and economic integration of six Eurasian countries. The Caribbean Development Bank finances projects in the Caribbean region, and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, based in Kuwait, provides development finance to Arab countries. </p><p> There is no pan-Asean financing institution.</p><p> Filling financing gapsAlthough Asean can continue to depend on its traditional partners such as the ADB, AIIB, China and Japan for financing large projects, an Asean Bank for Development could help to support projects that may not easily get sufficient funding from other sources. </p><p> These could include projects that promote greater economic integration, such as regional energy grids, cross-border transportation networks, greater digital connectivity across the region and the harmonisation of product and service standards. </p><p> It could play an instrumental role in the reconstruction of Myanmar, which will be needed sooner or later. It could also respond quickly to natural disasters, many of which are cross-border in nature.</p><p> Using its localised knowledge, it could also fund projects that fall between the cracks -- that is, those which are too small for the likes of the ADB and AIIB and which address funding gaps at local levels. </p><p> These could include community-based energy projects, such as small-scale solar farms and micro-hydro projects in remote areas, the upgrading of village roads, building small bridges to connect isolated communities, climate adaptation initiatives such as building flood defences at the community level, helping mobile health clinics to deliver healthcare to underserved areas, establishing or renovating local museums and cultural centres, and supporting programmes to nurture and preserve traditional arts and crafts.</p><p> It would also have governance advantages. Unlike existing development financing institutions in which Asean's stake and voting power is small, an Asean Bank would foster a greater sense of ownership among Asean member states, which would control the bank. </p><p> They, rather than other powers, would be able to set the bank's agenda, priorities and strategic directions. </p><p> An Asean Bank would also be freer to innovate in ways that traditional development banks do not. For example, it could partner with fintechs to serve under-banked communities, tap blended finance -- that is, finance from companies through their corporate social responsibility programmes, as well as philanthropic organisations -- and work with local governments and non-governmental organisations, which are already active in several local-level initiatives. </p><p> Over time, it could also develop mechanisms to extend financing in local currencies.</p><p> Some governance issues will be challenging to address, such as how the bank should be capitalised and re-capitalised, how its shareholding should be divided among Asean member states, how its leadership should be determined and where it should be based. </p><p> These issues would need to be resolved politically.</p><p> That may seem a tall order, but it will be worth the effort. </p><p> An Asean Bank for Development would be a valuable public good for the grouping with a potential impact that will be greater than the sum of its parts. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The UN Development Programme figures that Asean needs another US$100 billion to US$150 billion a year in social investments, especially in health and education, to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality.

These include carbon capture technologies, forest restoration, swopping pollutive cookstoves for cleaner ones, and renewable energy projects. </p><p> Not all projects can make the cut. In late 2023, Singapore released a set of eligibility criteria to ensure that credits and projects are of high quality. </p><p> For example, in calculating the amount of emissions removed by a mangrove planting project, the calculations must be made in a conservative and transparent way, and measured and verified by an independent third party. </p><p> The National Environment Agency also released a list of specific types of projects or methodologies that Singapore is willing to accept, based on existing carbon crediting programmes. These include international carbon credits that come from offshore wind technology and cleaner cookstoves. </p><p> Internationally, a recent oversupply of carbon credits from renewable energy projects failed to deliver additional climate benefits, noted Ms Melissa Low, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. </p><p> How far along is Singapore in trading carbon credits'Of the 19 countries Singapore is collaborating with on carbon credits, two have finalised bilateral agreements with Singapore so far -- Papua New Guinea and Ghana. These are known as implementation agreements. </p><p> This means companies here can buy carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions, provided the carbon projects in Papua New Guinea and Ghana meet Singapore's eligibility criteria. </p><p> Steps must be taken to prevent the double-counting of emission reductions in both the carbon credit buyer (Singapore) and the host country's national greenhouse gas inventories. </p><p> And in each agreement, climate adaptation for the host country and the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions must be prioritised. </p><p> For example, carbon credit project developers must contribute 5 per cent of their share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana. </p><p> Project developers must also cancel 2 per cent of carbon credits at first issuance, so that those credits will not enter the carbon market. The 2 per cent has the sole purpose of reducing emissions.</p><p> These requirements are based on Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which governs the bilateral trade of carbon credits between countries. </p><p> Of the remaining 17 countries, Singapore has concluded negotiations on similar carbon credit schemes with Vietnam, Paraguay and Bhutan. The next step will be to sign the agreements. </p><p>Singapore has also signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with other countries such as Laos, Indonesia and Fiji, with the intention of collaborating on carbon credits.</p><p> A fair amount of negotiations takes place before an MOU becomes a bilateral agreement, said Ms Low. </p><p> \"This would include an assessment of the respective countries' climate targets and level of ambition and whether the respective countries have arrangements in place to transparently report on their greenhouse gas inventories,\" she added. </p><p> It took 10 months for Singapore and Ghana to conclude negotiations on their deal.</p><p> As at May, only one carbon credit transaction under Article 6.2 has taken place between Thailand and Switzerland. </p><p> According to a carbon market explainer by The Nature Conservancy, such international transactions will take time, and bilateral agreements are only the first step.</p><p> \"Countries still have several additional steps, such as providing letters of authorisation, complying with reporting requirements and, once the project is concluded, starting monitoring and verification processes. Only after the first monitoring cycle is completed can the first issuance and first transfer (of credits) take place,\" stated the report.</p><p> Checks by ST in January revealed that Singapore companies looking to buy carbon credits from Papua New Guinea must wait longer for eligible projects that are of high quality, as none of the available credits for sale currently meets the criteria set by the Singapore Government. </p><p> On June 20, it was announced that more than 100,000 improved cookstoves will be distributed to communities in Papua New Guinea that still rely on open-fire cooking. This project was approved by carbon crediting programme Verra. </p><p> The project's developer, Tasman Environmental Markets, said it is working with Singapore and Papua New Guinea to finalise the approval of its project under both countries' carbon credit agreement. </p><p> In July, Verra suspended 27 cookstove projects over allegations of over-issuance of millions of carbon credits, Ms Low pointed out.</p><p> \"So, it remains to be seen if cookstove projects in Papua New Guinea will eventually be eligible for use under Singapore's framework,\" she said.</p><p> Ms Low added that the authorities are organising a business mission to Ghana in July, and this may help companies in Singapore explore opportunities there. </p><p> How does carbon trading benefit Singapore and the host country'Carbon markets help to channel funds to nature-based and underfunded forest conservation projects that would not otherwise have been implemented due to factors such as insufficient policy and economic incentives. </p><p> Carbon projects can further the sustainable development of host countries, benefit local communities in terms of job creation and access to clean resources, and improve their energy security. Environmental pollution can also be reduced while protecting the rights of indigenous groups. </p><p> Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero has been investing in a forest restoration project in the Kwahu region of Ghana. It involves replanting degraded forest reserves, including growing cocoa trees sustainably in shaded farms to shield the plantations from disasters and pests. </p><p> Jobs in farming and agroforestry training will be created, and there will be new income opportunities for indigenous communities. The verification of carbon credits from the Ghana project will begin in 2028.</p><p> As for Singapore, buying carbon credits can benefit carbon-tax-liable firms as the tax is set to increase. The carbon tax in 2024 has increased to $25 per tonne of CO2 emissions, up from $5 per tonne previously. By 2030, the tax will eventually reach $50 to $80 per tonne. </p><p> Companies can potentially cut their carbon tax liability if they can procure carbon credits that are lower than the prevailing tax rate of $25 per tonne, noted Ms Low. </p><p> Being an alternative-energy-disadvantaged country, Singapore can tap carbon credits to meet its national climate targets, also known as NDCs. </p><p> But this will have trade-offs for the host country. The more credits a host country exports to Singapore, the less mitigation can be claimed against its own climate goals, stated The Nature Conservancy explainer. </p><p> \"Even when domestic frameworks are in place, a more complex issue will arise as host countries define what sectors, how many units at what price they could transfer internationally without undermining the achievement of their NDCs,\" the report stated.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["This means companies here can buy carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions, provided the carbon projects in Papua New Guinea and Ghana meet Singapore's eligibility criteria.

Earlier in September, he announced his intention to restructure the Public Works and Housing Ministry by splitting it into two ministries, which he believes will allow Indonesia to streamline efforts to construct 15 million homes by the end of his term. Local media has also reported that Mr Prabowo is keen on splitting the Environment and Forestry Ministry, as well as planning stand-alone government agencies for water security and revenue collection. </p><p> Having more ministries could allow greater specialisation in handling specific issues, said Indonesia-based PermataBank chief economist Josua Pardede.</p><p> There is also the potential benefit of making the government more flexible and adaptable when it comes to addressing crises, said Mr Josua. \"For instance, specific ministries focusing on health, climate adaptation or food security might be better equipped to respond swiftly to emerging threats like pandemics or natural disasters,\" he told The Straits Times.</p><p> But he said such potential benefits can be fully realised only if the government ensures efficient coordination, clear roles and accountability across the newly formed ministries.</p><p> In theory, breaking down ministries into more specialised roles could reduce bureaucratic bottlenecks and sharpen their focus, Mr Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel, told ST.

The key takeaways from the SFAP discussion include:</p><p>* A whole-of-ecosystem approach is critical to accelerate coal transition. SFAP members emphasised the urgency of managed phase-out of coal-fired power plants, which must take place alongside the development of clean energy sources, in Asia's energy transition. A comprehensive approach that provides credibility for early phase-out projects and innovative financing structures, regulatory clarity on financed emissions, and appropriate policy reforms, will be needed to scale coal transition.</p><p>* Accelerating the adoption of sustainable aviation and marine fuels is key to the decarbonisation of the aviation and maritime transport sectors.

This is a momentum that governments can build on. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute survey of nearly 3,000 people in all 10 Asean nations between July 10 and Aug 17 found that not only were people taking practical steps to reduce their impact on the planet, but they were also prepared to accept a hit to their hip pocket to make a difference. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A majority of South-east Asians made at least one lifestyle change in the past year for the sake of climate. Steps included cutting down on single-use plastics, reducing electricity consumption and opting to take public transport. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As well as this stronger-than- expected shift to individual responsibility, nearly half want fossil fuel subsidies cut in their own countries. Importantly, support for a national carbon tax also grew to 70 per cent of respondents, up from 68 per cent the previous year. And an overwhelming 93 per cent of those who support such a tax are willing to take on a share of the tax burden as an individual consumer.</p><p> The findings suggest that the window is open for governments to take decisive policy action. </p><p> Two critical areas emerged in the survey that they could act on: a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and investing in a regional power grid. </p><p> Their action will require a systemic policy approach, aligning economic, social and environmental goals through coordinated actions across multiple sectors.</p><p> Fossil fuel subsidies:  What governments can doForty-seven per cent of survey respondents support a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies; 13 per cent were against it. But a middle group of \"swing voters\" -- about 35 per cent -- say they cannot decide one way or the other because of a lack of information about how their families will be affected if subsidies are removed.</p><p> This group can be persuaded. Governments can do this by discussing the economic, environmental and health impact of overdependence on fossil fuel subsidies, and by explaining how subsidies can be reallocated to more public funding for climate adaptation and other social programmes.</p><p> This is where Asean governments can go the extra mile, with inclusive dialogue that demonstrates transparency and by giving policy assurances on how the subsidies will be spent, such as on creating social safety nets for people who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. </p><p>Malaysia has already taken a first step, moving from blanket to targeted diesel subsidies in July.</p><p> The situation in Indonesia is complex, although given the survey findings, it can afford to be more resolute in pushing through this difficult issue. </p><p> The removal of subsidies there is politically sensitive because of potential social instability caused by the rising cost of living. </p><p> President-elect Prabowo Subianto's plans to reallocate subsidies to the nation's school lunch programme are politically acceptable as they can be rationalised as nurturing the next generation -- but with the removal of fossil fuel subsidies, he would need to take a gradual and targeted approach. </p><p> A calibrated approach makes sense as it allows governments to fine-tune policies in response to the impact of subsidy reforms and energy transition measures. </p><p> Factoring in the social and economic impacts is important because, while many respondents say they are prepared individually to do their part in climate action, the survey also found that more people in the region are concerned about bread-and- butter issues such as food security than about climate change. Even in Singapore, in the vanguard of clean energy transition in the region, 63 per cent of respondents are very concerned about rising energy costs and the impact on the cost of living.</p><p> It is vital that people look beyond that short-term pain. Globally, US$7 trillion (S$9 trillion) -- equivalent to 7.1 per cent of global gross domestic product -- was spent on fossil fuel subsidies in 2022. Subsidies also exact less obvious environmental and climate costs. Removing them could prevent 1.6 million premature deaths due to air pollution, increase government coffers by US$4.4 trillion and put the world back on track to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, says the International Monetary Fund.</p><p> Support for an  Asean power gridNearly half the survey's respondents want governments to facilitate the development of regional energy infrastructure to accelerate a clean energy transition. It is an idea not without cause -- the International Energy Agency estimates that Asean has sufficient renewable energy sources to power itself and more. The question is, how to tap and distribute these resources, granting equal access across the region.</p><p> In fact, an Asean power grid (APG) has been in discussion for almost three decades. Currently, only half of the 18 planned interconnections are completed.</p><p> However, new bilateral interconnections and sub-regional power integration projects are leading to a reimagination of the original APG.</p><p> New subsea and overland interconnections are being planned outside the APG framework, such as one between Laos and Vietnam, Singapore-Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia-Sumatra, Sarawak-Singapore, Vietnam-Singapore, and a new Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines Power Integration Project (PIP), akin to the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore PIP which will trade low-carbon electricity generated from hydropower or other renewable energy sources. </p><p> These could inspire a new Asean power grid 2.0 that need not require all the remaining interconnections to be completed. In fact, plans should, and must, evolve to meet new needs and demands. A systems policy approach at the regional level has to continuously evaluate what works and what does not. </p><p> Major infrastructure investments, amounting to nearly US$21 billion annually from now to 2030, will be required to bring these plans to fruition. Early inclusion of multilateral development banks and financial institutions is key to getting blended public and private finance.</p><p> An APG-dedicated financing facility would certainly help. But just having ready financing is not useful without open and transparent information of key priority APG projects to help investors decide. The European Union's Projects of Common Interest help investors prioritise the more urgent energy transition projects and speed up licensing and approvals. Asean can do something similar. </p><p> What is holding the  region back'What is lacking is the political will to bite the bullet by suffering short-term pain for long-term gain. </p><p> When the annual regional survey was launched in 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 outbreak, over 60 per cent of South-east Asians wanted their governments to prioritise climate action over the pandemic response, despite the severe health and economic threats. </p><p> The desire for clear, decisive climate action by governments remains strong. However, removing blanket fossil fuel subsidies and implementing carbon taxes without adequate political buy-in could be a massive vote-loser amid inflationary pressures and economic uncertainties.</p><p> There is no common template that guarantees success for countries in moving from subsidies to deploying new technology and implementing carbon taxes. For example, a carbon tax may work in Singapore -- the Republic introduced it in 2019 -- but a compliance emissions trading scheme (ETS) may not. </p><p> An ETS allows regulators to set a cap on how much greenhouse gas emissions can be emitted in a sector or economy, and then allows tradable allowances. </p><p> Then again, some countries such as Indonesia could accept a combination of taxation and ETS, because their access to resources could spur technology innovation, while a carbon tax in certain sectors could be easily regulated. </p><p> Regardless of the specific transition challenges confronting each Asean country, the survey results show that people are willing to make sacrifices and take more responsibility for climate action. Governments should make the most of this window of opportunity to put in place policies that will benefit the planet in the long term.</p><p> Sharon Seah is senior fellow and coordinator of the Climate Change in South-east Asia Programme at the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["But a middle group of \"swing voters\" -- about 35 per cent -- say they cannot decide one way or the other because of a lack of information about how their families will be affected if subsidies are removed.

Just adapt and avoid the pain of pushing back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Australian statecraft is more than a bipolar game of primacy. </p><p> There is merit in a comprehensive and evidence-based appraisal of what Australia is actually doing to make its way in the connected and contested Indo-Pacific region so many nations share.</p><p> Instead, the Australian story gives a sense of what creative diplomacy can do in helping ensure a region of stability, predictability, resilience and respect for the sovereign rights of nations large and small alike.</p><p> In other words, how a middle power can support the conditions for prosperity and peace.</p><p> Diplomacy of stabilitySince its election in May 2022, the Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, with Foreign Minister Penny Wong at the helm of its statecraft, has pursued a sophisticated foreign policy underpinned by the concept of \"strategic equilibrium\". This seeks to balance deterrence, diplomacy and development. </p><p> Yes, it involves the need to work with others -- and not only America -- in deterring China from disrupting regional order or initiating conflict.</p><p> But it also places large emphasis on the diplomacy of stability. In the region, this means support for dialogue and risk-reduction measures to prevent maritime incidents escalating to conflict.</p><p> Indeed, Asean and Asean-centric institutions have no firmer friend than Australia, as was clear in the special summit held in Melbourne in March. Australian diplomats strive each year to help Asean-centric institutions such as the East Asia Summit live up to their founding promise.</p><p> And bilaterally with China, the Albanese government has emphasised \"stabilisation\": cooperating where possible, disagreeing where necessary and always acting in the national interest. As a participant in last month's high-level dialogue with a Chinese delegation in Adelaide, I can attest the exchange was robust and constructive. We are well past the earlier phase of diplomatic confrontation and China's counterproductive economic coercion.</p><p> Such stabilisation-based engagement, with leadership-level visits in both directions, hardly suggests that Canberra is imagining away the realities of Beijing's power and potential, even while being cleared-eyed about the limitations and risks.</p><p> Blue Pacific interestsJust as the past few years of Australian diplomacy have stressed closer cooperation with South-east Asia, so too has there been emphasis on friendship with the nations and peoples of the Blue Pacific; more than that, practical and development-focused collaboration has been infused with what Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko has defined as \"strategic trust\".</p><p> There's no question that concern about growing Chinese influence and presence has been a major spur to Canberra's policy vigour. Plainly, it is in Australia's interests to ensure that an authoritarian military power cannot one day be in a position to project force on our eastern flank, in what has since 1945 been essentially an ocean of peace.</p><p> Foreign Minister Wong has acknowledged that, sadly, the two countries will be in a permanent contest for influence in the Pacific.</p><p> But for Australia, this is also about doubling down on decades of partnership with its Pacific \"family\", where we have never stopped being the development partner of scale and choice.</p><p> Every major collective indication from Pacific governments -- from the 2018 Boe Declaration on regional security, to the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, to recent announcements at the Pacific Islands Forum summit in Tonga -- affirms an openness to precisely the kind of approach Australia is taking.</p><p> That is, engagement that is Pacific-led, based on deep consultation and local needs, whether on economic development, resource management, governance, health, connectivity, or addressing the impacts of climate change. </p><p> Pacific nations are clear about preserving their independence, cultural integrity and democratic character, just as they assert their rights to engage with many partners, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the United States, South-east Asia, India, South Korea, Europe or indeed China -- or even, in some cases, Taiwan. </p><p> All this sets the scene for the latest developments, notably the finalisation of the Australia-Indonesia Defence Cooperation Agreement and the many-nation Pacific Policing Initiative.</p><p> Confusingly, my colleague Prof White sees these success stories as proof that Australia is losing \"credibility\" by fruitlessly trying to draw its neighbours into a coalition to support the US against China. </p><p> The reality is more subtle and less exciting, as befits the grinding work of real statecraft. </p><p>Indonesia defence tiesCanberra has no illusions that there is even a possibility of seeking an anti-China mutual defence pact with Jakarta, and no serious policy voice in either country is contemplating a formal alliance. </p><p> Of course, Australia and Indonesia need each other as forces for stability and strength, and it makes good sense to do precisely what the new military agreement does: train together, operate with consent from each other's countries, share education and, where possible, technological know-how. </p><p> The new Australia-Indonesia agreement is a measure of mutual consent and common interest, translated by proactive diplomacy through the art of the possible. To suggest otherwise is to imagine absurdly that a dynamic, proud and rising power of 280 million people lacks agency or the free and active foreign policy for which it is known.</p><p> Meanwhile, the Pacific Policing Initiative is best understood as part of a wider web of cooperation by which Pacific nations are pooling capability for good effect. This involves shared training in Brisbane as well as across multiple centres of excellence in various Pacific nations, and the creation of a common deployment force for major events and crisis response. Pacific experts point out that it is the revitalisation of a model under which Australia and many neighbours supported Solomon Islands from 2003 to 2017, and Pacific leaders have welcomed it as the response to genuine regional need, including in countering the drug trade and supporting public order.</p><p> The specifics have been driven by a consensus of Pacific Islands chiefs of police and have been more than a year in the making. So the private suggestion by a leading US official that Washington was giving Australia the \"lane\" on this issue was both inaccurate and unnecessary, given that this was a Pacific-led deal that had already been done.</p><p> The policing outcome was announced last month when Pacific leaders gathered in Tonga, along with the establishment of a multilateral Pacific Resilience Facility -- for agile funding of climate adaptation projects -- and entry-into-force of the Falepili Union. This is an innovative treaty in which Australia guarantees a future for the people and sovereignty of the small island nation of Tuvalu, even if rising sea levels cover their low-lying territory.</p><p> There are always things to question about any nation's foreign policy settings, and being our best critics is a fine Australian tradition, at home and abroad. Nor are there any guarantees that the current government's goal of equilibrium can be achieved or sustained, given that it requires many nations to work together for regional resilience. </p><p> But whatever the faults of where Australian policy stands today, a lack of respect for the priorities of its neighbours is not one of them. The world may be increasingly a topsy-turvy place where truth is hard to discern. Yet one thing should remain obvious: Securing creative deals with its neighbours is evidence of a nation's credibility and not the opposite. </p><p> Professor Rory Medcalf is head of the National Security College at the Australian National University.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The specifics have been driven by a consensus of Pacific Islands chiefs of police and have been more than a year in the making.

Good morning. I am happy to join all of you at the 8th MENDAKI Symposium.</p><p>Implications of Climate Change</p><p>2. While I am heartened to see many youths among the audience today, something that weighs heavy on my mind is climate change. It is a reality that we simply cannot ignore. It is not something that will happen 30 years down the road. It is already happening today. We are experiencing warmer temperatures globally. It is quite clear that temperatures are going up.</p><p>3. How does this impact us? We are receiving frequent reminders of climate change through unprecedented weather events in cities around the world. From the record-breaking Hurricane Beryl which ripped through the Caribbean and is now slamming into Texas, to severe floods in parts of China and Brazil, to a scorching 51.8 degrees Celsius temperature in Mecca recently, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries. In Singapore, 2023 was our 4th warmest year on record, and it has been forecasted by the Meteorological ServiceSingapore (MSS) that 2024 could be an even warmer year than 2023. Already scientists are telling us that temperatures for June 2024 is going to be record-breaking around the world. I am sure many of us agree that we are feeling the brunt of the weather these days.</p><p>4. These weather events and weather changes cause devastating results such as deaths, injury, damage and loss of property and even uncertainties in global food supply due to a reduction in crop yield. We are not merely victims of climate change. Decades of burning fossil fuels for energy, industrialisation and unsustainable deforestation and consumption practices have contributed to the climate change which we experience today. We are the cause of climate change.</p><p>Climate Action</p><p>5. These events send a clear message on the pressing need for immediate action. In Singapore, we have pledged to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. Achieving net zero is a whole-of-nation effort, involving the public and private sectors, communities, as well as individuals. That is why we launched the SG Green Plan 2030 in 2021, which charts concrete targets in five Pillars over the next 10 years that will position us to achieve our long-term net zero emissions aspiration by 2050. We are increasing our carbon tax rate and introducing new policies to decarbonise our economy, energy and households.</p><p>Aviation sector</p><p>6. As an aviation hub, Singapore is playing our role in decarbonising the aviation sector by scaling up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel used in airplanes. Flights departing from Singapore will be required to use SAF from 2026. We will aim for a 1% SAF target for a start, with the goal of increasing it to 3 to 5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF. It is not just about airlines wanting to do it. The supply of SAF also has to come on stream, and in time. SAF is expected to contribute around 65% of emissions reductions needed by aviation to achieve net zero by 2050.</p><p>Maritime sector</p><p>7. In the maritime industry, Singapore is also playing a leading role in catalysing the development and uptake of zero and near-zero emission solutions. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), with the support of industry partners and the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) conducted the world's first ship-to-containership methanol bunkering operation in July 2023, followed by a more complex simultaneous methanol bunkering and cargo operation in May 2024. We have also conducted the world's first use of ammonia as a marine fuel in March 2024 within the Port of Singapore, onboard the Fortescue Green Pioneer. By switching away from conventional marine fuels to these cleaner alternative fuels, we can significantly reduce carbon emissions generated from the maritime industry. We have also established five Green and Digital Shipping Corridors (GDSCs) along key shipping and fuel supply routes with like-minded partners in Asia, Europe, and North America. These GDSCs serve as a test bed environment for pilot projects and facilitate stakeholder collaboration towards a more sustainable maritime industry.</p><p>8. Climate action has been focused on climate mitigation, which are efforts and ways to reduce climate greenhouse gas emissions, and to reduce the effects of climate change, adaptation is a topic that is very much talked about in the climate circuit. Because while we are mitigating, we must also prepare for warmer temperatures. The world also needs to focus on climate adaptation - to adapt to the effects of climate change which we are already feeling and to adapt to greater unpredictability of the weather system which affects our food sources and water supply.</p><p>9. In Singapore, we are reviewing and refining our adaptation plans to incorporate the latest climate projections from our Third National Climate Change Study (V3), which has projected higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels. For example, to enhance our flood and coastal resilience, we are carrying out studies to explore different solutions, including the 'Long Island'. This is a stretch of new land is going to be reclaimed, creating a new boundary that will protect us from coastal floods, and new land for us. We also have to ensure our food resiliency, and we do so through a multi-pronged approach. Complementing import source diversification and stockpiling, is the 'grow local' basket, which through productive, climate resilient, resource efficient local food production, acts as a buffer against disruptions to food imports. This is about building capability, the know-how to grow in a climate resilient way. For this, we have set the aspiration of the \"30 by 30\" vision, to build up our agri-food industry's capability and capacity to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030.</p><p>10. Despite accounting for just 0.1% of the world's emissions, Singapore is doing our part to support climate action internationally. We are committed to supporting and accelerating the transition towards a net zero future in Singapore, in the region, and beyond. For example, we are actively contributing to blended finance initiatives in the region, and have signed carbon credit Implementation Agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana, which will help spur the development of international carbon markets.</p><p>11. At COP-28 last year, Singapore played a key role in facilitating the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake which reviewed the world's progress towards meeting the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal. No effort is too small. Despite our size and constraints, Singapore continues to punch above our weight and contribute to international efforts. In addition, Singapore is committed to supporting fellow developing countries in their efforts to address climate change through capacity-building assistance. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), more than 150,000 officials from over 180 countries and territories have been trained in topics such as climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, and green finance. The Sustainability Action Package (SAP) was launched under the SCP in 2022 to focus on sustainability themes, including green project management, low carbon development and carbon markets. To date, we have organised 45 courses for over 1,000 participants under the SAP.</p><p>The Role of Youths</p><p>12. Youths have a significant role to play in Singapore's sustainability journey and fight against climate change. Initiatives led by governments, businesses and community organisations provide youths with resources, mentorship, and a conducive environment to have a stake in their future and champion issues they care deeply about.</p><p>13. One initiative led by the Government is the Climate Youth Development Programme (CYDP). Co-led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, the National Climate Change Secretariat and the National Youth Council, the programme was established in July 2023 to strengthen partnership with the youth community in advancing climate action for sustainable development. Through the inaugural programme last year, 40 youths had the opportunity to develop the knowledge, skillsets and networks to contribute to Singapore's sustainability efforts through conversations with climate change advocates, policymakers, and related events such as the Singapore International Energy Week 2023, Ecosperity and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) COP28.</p><p>14. The National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the Youth for Environmental Sustainability, or YES, Leaders Programme, to bring together partners from the People, Public and Private to address environmental issues through innovative solutions and collaborations. Launched in 2023, the programme offers our youth leaders a unique opportunity to channel their passion for the environment into tangible projects with meaningful impact. We are also seeing youths and organisations tapping on the SG Eco Fund to drive ground-up sustainability initiatives in their community, in areas ranging from waste reduction and recycling to community growing of food.</p><p>15. One such project is by the Malay Youth Literary Association, which started a \"Youth Eco Action\" project to create awareness on environmental sustainability among youths through interactive activities such as pairing clean-ups with cycling and kayaking, gardening and waste upcycling workshops, and farm tours. I encourage youths who are keen to work on environmental initiatives to come forward and apply for the SG Eco Fund to carry out your projects. We have also partnered with MOE, such as through the SG Perspectives series, to engage the youths so that they can better understand Singapore's context and policy considerations.</p><p>16. To the youths, I know it might sound daunting or you might not know where to start, but there are those who have gone before you.</p><p>17. We have Ms Farah Sanwari, who is an active youth leader who co-founded FiTree, an Islamic environmental group; and Repair Kopitiam, an initiative involving repair enthusiasts who believe in giving used appliances a second life. I had the honour to present Singapore's Voluntary National Review of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at United Nations in New York with Farah. She presented Singapore's report card on the SDGs. She added richness to the discussions, and for the community, the people sector to be represented.</p><p>18. Meanwhile, Mr Muhammad Ibnur Rashad is the founder of social enterprise Ground Up Innovation Labs for Development (GUILD) and has conducted workshops to educate the public on recycling waste plastics into 3D-printed planters, which were used to create a floating garden system.</p><p>19. I would like to mention a third person - Naeem Nadzri. As you may know, Singapore played a leadership role at the sessions at COP-28 where I co-facilitated negotiations on mitigation. When I was co-facilitating, I noticed this young man taking notes. I found out later that he was there as a youth leader in our Climate Youth Development Programme. Naeem is really an inspiring person to me. I found that his work in sustainability, in understanding treatment and extraction of useful materials from our waste is very relevant.</p><p>20. If are able to extract the useful items from our waste, give them a second or third life, that is how we can reduce the need to mine even more. Every time when we change to a new electronic device, we are part of the reason why pits are being dug up. When you see photos of huge mining operations, where we are digging several tens of metres down into the earth to extract resources and causing environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, clearing of land. You and I are part of the cause. If we are able to give the resources endless life by recycling, extracting resources, separating the waste, then we can minimise the harm caused to the environment.</p><p>21. Youths are in the middle of action. From the three examples that I gave, you can see they are involved in community awareness, community engagement, and are putting their aspirations into action. They are going into the science and technological part of it to find new solutions. And there is really a whole range of different ways for us to enter the field of sustainability and climate change. This is really an area where your aspirations and your dreams can be put into action in a very seamless way.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>22. In 2050, how old would you be? What future do you want your children to grow up in? Start today to own the future, shape the future, so that the future will be what you want it to be. That is why youth involvement is so important. You have the runway ahead of you. Own the future and put your aspirations into actions.</p><p>23.

As we start the new year, I thought we would share some reflections from the recent COP28 in Dubai last month, to give us a sense of where we have come and where we are heading.<br/><br/>3. COP28 marked the first-ever Global Stocktake of the world's progress towards meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. For the first time, a decision has been reached to transition away from fossil fuels in our energy systems. And more than ever, there is a realisation that we may have the means to make the necessary course corrections to get to net zero by scaling up renewable energy deployment, energy efficiency improvement and removing the stock of carbon in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>4. However, the Global Stocktake was also a stark reminder that current efforts are not sufficient to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C. And this was at the heart of most of the discussion stretching deep into the night during COP28, that we cannot afford to sit idly by, because the effects are already here and affecting our lives. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, 2023 is the warmest year on record. Across the globe, communities experienced extreme weather events, from deadly wildfires in Canada and Greece, to torrential rains and floods in India, Pakistan and China, and a sweltering heatwave in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, we matched our historical high temperature of 37C in May 2023. The heat, coupled with high humidity in our environment, brings serious health risks. Such extreme weather occurrences are projected to increase in frequency and intensity, and undoubtedly many of us are concerned how much worse they may become, and how we are preparing.<br/><br/>Third National Climate Change Study<br/><br/>5. Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore, and the Government treats it with utmost seriousness. We are investing significantly to better understand it, and starting our planning and preparatory works. Since 2007, we have undertaken three National Climate Change Studies to better understand the impact of climate change on Singapore.<br/><br/>6. The Third National Climate Change Study, or V3, is the latest. Led by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), V3 provides the world's highest resolution climate projections for Singapore and the Southeast Asia region until the end of the century. Working off the 6th Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), V3 shows climate projections based on three global emission scenarios - low, medium and high, with the effects of climate change more pronounced under the high emissions scenario.<br/><br/>7. V3 is the result of years of careful investments, in not only climate science but also supercomputing. CCRS partnered the National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) to work on coarse global climate models to obtain finer climate projections for Singapore and our region. This is akin to zooming in from a big world map to a map of Singapore that displays our streets and landmarks. To achieve this, the teams had to make sense of billions of climate data points spanning multiple decades.<br/><br/>8. I congratulate CCRS and NSCC on the successful completion of V3. This achievement advances scientific understanding of our tropical climate and sets a benchmark for future climate projections. More importantly, V3 provides a common scientific basis for all interested parties - government agencies, businesses, academia and community groups - to prepare for a climate-resilient future.<br/><br/>9. V3 shows that we will have to contend with more extreme climate conditions - higher temperatures, heavier rainfalls and longer and more frequent dry spells. These climate conditions may also lead to other indirect climate challenges, including disruptions to water and food. Armed with these projections, we will strive to safeguard a sustainable, resilient and liveable Singapore for our future generations, just as our forefathers had done for us.<br/><br/>Climate Action in Singapore<br/><br/>Climate Mitigation<br/><br/>10. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement in limiting global warming, a global solution is required. We will do our part. We have committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and have been taking active steps to mitigate climate change and transit to a low-carbon future.<br/><br/>11. From 1 Jan, we have raised our carbon tax to $25 per tonne. We will progressively raise the carbon tax level further, to $50 to $80 by 2030.<br/><br/>12. As a small, alternative energy disadvantaged island nation, we have looked towards innovation and collaboration to transform our energy supply. We are making innovative use of our limited land by deploying solar panels on rooftops and reservoirs, and are collaborating on cross-border green energy trade.<br/><br/>13. Decarbonisation of the international maritime and aviation sectors is also high on our agenda. We are preparing our maritime hub for a multi-fuel transition. We are piloting projects for biofuels, methanol and ammonia. We have also been collaborating with other international ports and partners to promote Green and Digital Shipping Corridors. On the aviation front, we are home to the largest production facility for sustainable aviation fuel. We are exploring ways to promote the offtake of SAF to regional and international airlines at Changi Airport, moving the needle on low-carbon air travel.<br/><br/>Climate Adaptation<br/><br/>14. The Government will co-create solutions on adaptation with the community by setting aside resources, and strengthen our climate adaption plans.<br/><br/>15. With the release of V3, we will review our existing plans and ensure their relevance. We will also look out for new climate risks that may require our attention. I will highlight two aspects of climate impacts.<br/><br/>16. First, on tackling rising sea levels. This presents an opportunity to reimagine the design of our coastlines, to create new benefits such as additional recreational spaces for the community, and conserving nature and biodiversity. Last November, we announced plans to start technical studies for the 'Long Island', which could involve reclaiming around 800 hectares of land and protect the low-lying East Coast of Singapore from rising sea levels. This will integrate coastal protection with future land use needs, create a new freshwater reservoir to enhance long-term water resilience and create new possibilities for parks and recreational activities. We will take into consideration stakeholders' views and suggestions from Our Coastal Conversations led by PUB, and we will seek feedback from stakeholders on the plans for the 'Long Island' and other segments of the coast. To enhance our engineering capability, we launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (or CFI) Singapore, hosted at NUS. This brings together the strengths of local institutes and the industry to take on this decades-long challenge.<br/><br/>17. The second part is about coping with rising temperatures. We have utilised passive design strategies to remain cool in our warm climate. These include intensifying greenery in our urban areas and orienting buildings along the North-South direction to reduce heat gain. More recently, we have used measurements, modelling and simulation to improve our city design and enhance our knowledge of urban heat and its impact on human health. We are also actively strengthening our community's resilience to cope with heat. Last year, we launched the Heat Stress Advisory to empower residents to make more informed decisions when engaging in outdoor activities. Specific sectors such as employers of outdoor workers, schools and operators of residential homes have also put in place enhanced measures to protect vulnerable segments from heat stress.<br/><br/>18. As a broader point, we will need to continue to deepen our understanding of these climate risks, to inform our long-term plans. CCRS launched a first grant call last year under the Climate Impact Science Research Programme. I am pleased to announce that eight projects have been awarded under the first grant call to a diverse group of researchers across our Institutes of Higher Learning. Armed with the V3 results, these projects will investigate the impact of climate change on vector-borne and chronic diseases, changes in our tropical forest landscape, and our food security, to name a few.<br/><br/>19. Today, CCRS will launch the second grant call for proposals to better understand climate change impacts on Singapore's water resources, maritime and port infrastructure, the incursion and spread of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, and our abilities to adapt to heat. I encourage our scientists and industry partners in the audience today to participate in the grant call.<br/><br/>International Collaborations in Climate Science &amp; Adaptation<br/><br/>20. Just as with decarbonisation efforts, countries have to work with and support one another to accelerate climate adaptation. Singapore will contribute expertise and resources for international capacity building, such as in the IPCC process. Professor Winston Chow, who is here today, is the Co-Chair of the IPCC's Working Group II. He will lead the next cycle of work in the 7th Assessment Report (AR7) to assess climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities across diverse communities and ecosystems. These findings will serve as a globally recognised basis for international negotiations at future UN Climate Change Conferences. We will also share our V3 data with our regional partners through the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre to support scientific understanding of climate change and associated impacts. And we will provide V3 data to inform the climate impacts assessments tools of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, to enable users in our region to conduct more detailed assessments of their agriculture sectors and equip themselves better to respond to climate change.<br/><br/>Closing<br/><br/>21.Everyone has a part to play in tackling climate change. CCRS will make the findings publicly available via the Data Visualisation Portal, to encourage greater access. With this information, researchers can co-create climate-resilient solutions and communicate important scientific knowledge. Businesses can lead the way by adopting more sustainable practices, tracking your carbon footprint and setting a net zero target year. Community groups can raise awareness about climate change and mobilise action, such as nature conservation.<br/><br/>22. I hope today's Symposium will give you a renewed sense of purpose and energy in climate action. I wish you all a fruitful session ahead.

But if we have proof points, your investments that are proving out the return or the project that worked... (we can say) here's a good one. Copy it. And... that's when you start to see that scaling effect start to take hold,\" said Ms Drew. </p><p> Mr Koh said the list of climate hazards that scientists have warned about can serve as \"shopping lists\" for technologies and solutions to deal with these challenges. </p><p> He cited one solution his firm will soon announce that it is funding: an artificial intelligence company that analyses satellite imagery for vegetation management for utilities. </p><p> \"Sparking from power lines, globally, is what causes the giant wildfires we are seeing in the United States, Australia and other countries where vegetation, trees, shrubs, grasses encroach too much on the transmission distribution lines,\" he said. </p><p> Currently, managing this threat is done manually, Mr Koh said, with one group of workers identifying trees growing too close to the power lines, and another group coming in to trim the limbs that are getting too close.</p><p> \"However, this is not a scalable strategy with the acceleration (of climate impacts) that we're seeing now in heat events, weather events, and the kind of wildfire risks that we have,\" he said. </p><p> \"But now we have applications of technology, artificial intelligence, and satellite and drone imagery to enable over 40 utilities today to manage that risk in a much more efficient way,\" Mr Koh said. </p><p> The session was moderated by Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at management consultancy Boston Consulting Group, and featured as panellists Mr Koh, Ms Drew and two other speakers. </p><p> The two other speakers were Mr Tom Moody, regional director for South-east Asia, climate and energy at the British government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and Mr Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for the Asia-Pacific at reinsurance giant Swiss Re.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["in the market for climate resilience and adaptation solutions,\" said Mr Koh, who is also founder and chair of the Global Adaptation and Resilience Investment Working Group.

They are going to raise the cost,\" he told a panel discussion, moderated by The Straits Times editor Jaime Ho, on unlocking climate leadership in a competitive world. </p><p> The other panellists were Professor Julie Zimmerman, vice-provost for planetary solutions at Yale University, and Professor Kim Sang-hyup, co-chairman of South Korea's Presidential Commission on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth. </p><p> China, the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter, is also by far the largest producer and investor in renewable energy. The government sees green energy as key to reaching net-zero emissions by the mid-century. </p><p> Globally, in 2023, the world added 473 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. China accounted for the lion's share, adding another 297.6GW, mostly wind and solar. </p><p> This rapid growth in China, fuelled by state subsidies, has helped slash green energy costs globally, and further investment will drive costs down even more, said Mr Liu. </p><p> \"I think we are also prepared to collaborate with many of the developing countries to help them. So, globally, we have to maintain this process for both the innovation and manufacturing,\" he said. </p><p> The panel discussion comes against a backdrop of rising geopolitical and trade-related tensions and increasingly severe impacts from climate change, with 2023 being the hottest year on record.</p><p> More than ever, nations need to collaborate on financing innovation to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key guard rail under the 2015 UN Paris Agreement. </p><p> COP29 will be a major test of cooperation and willingness to step up the fight against climate change. At the summit in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku, nearly 200 countries will be tasked with agreeing on a new global goal for funding, called the New Collective Quantified Goal. </p><p> \"We must have an agreement on financial support at COP29,\" Mr Liu said. </p><p> But there are signs that getting agreement, a key measure of COP29's success, will be a fraught process. Climate finance has been one of the most divisive issues in three decades of UN climate negotiations.</p><p> Poorer nations, which are the most vulnerable to climate impacts but are least responsible for the emissions driving the climate crisis, say rich nations should provide funding to help them adapt to impacts and to green their fossil fuel-dependent economies. </p><p> Yet, the costs of climate impacts keep rising, and many poorer nations are deep in debt. </p><p> They are already missing out on much of the green investment boom globally because they lack the financial resources or policies to support investment. </p><p> Wealthy nations refuse to commit to large and growing climate costs, and want to spread the financial load to other countries.</p><p> Differences were laid bare during preparatory talks for COP29 in Bonn, Germany, that wrapped up on June 13. There were deep disagreements over the size of the goal, who should pay, how much to pay, and where the money would come from -- for example, from taxes on fossil fuels or debt swaps. </p><p> The new goal must be more than the existing US$100 billion (S$135 billion) that rich nations pledged back in 2009 to provide annually by 2020 -- and eventually reached in 2022. </p><p> The UN pointed to an independent report from 2023, which estimated that US$2.4 trillion of investments per year are needed by 2030 in developing countries -- excluding China.</p><p> This would be a fourfold increase from current levels, and includes public finance, as well as private finance and funding from sources including development banks.</p><p>India, African countries and small island nations have said more than US$1 trillion should be raised per year, but have mixed views on how much of this should come from government coffers.</p><p> The EU and US want to add new donors, including China and countries with high gross domestic product per capita, such as Qatar, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p> Beijing has firmly opposed this, and Mr Liu reiterated China's position.</p><p> \"China will not be a donor like OECD countries. But we are going to continue to support multilateral development banks in their efforts for the investment in climate action.

From late 2024, the European Union Green Bonds Standard (EUGBS) is set to transform issuance across the bloc in terms of reporting and transparency.</p><p> Close alignmentThe standard requires a close alignment with the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities and its six environmental objectives for sustainable activities: </p><p> Issuers of bonds under the EUGBS will be required to disclose detailed information about how the proceeds will be used to ensure alignment with the taxonomy. They must explain how the funds contribute to the sustainable transition, ensuring green investments are not negated by unsustainable activities in other areas.</p><p> The EUGBS builds on existing green bond frameworks, including the Green, Social and Sustainability Bond Principles formulated by the International Capital Market Association, alongside frameworks in China and India covering local markets.</p><p> The shift from voluntary to regulatory standards should enforce greater market discipline and encourage increased issuance of green, social and sustainable bonds.</p><p> Building on these improving standards, we have seen issuances covering a steadily widening range of themes in the last six months. Clean transportation -- particularly railway-related financing -- continues to dominate issuance from a thematic standpoint, but the market is seeing increased diversification.</p><p>Iceland, already the world's most gender-equal country, has become the first sovereign to issue a gender-based bond aimed at closing the gender gap further. Previously, only companies and development banks had issued gender-labelled bonds. Iceland's entry into this segment is notable, as it issued its first GSS bond -- a 750 million-euro (S$1.1 billion) green bond -- only in March 2024.</p><p> Entering the GSS bond market in 2022, Canada was the first sovereign issuer to include nuclear-energy expenditures in its March 2024 GSS bond of C$4 billion (S$3.96 billion) after the government updated its Green Bond Framework to include nuclear in its eligible investment areas.</p><p> The EU Taxonomy includes provisions for nuclear, so this could become a recurring GSS bond theme in the months ahead.</p><p> Other debutants to the green bond market include Turkey, which has raised US$2.5 billion, with the transaction more than three times oversubscribed. It was one of the first EM sovereigns to allocate a significant portion of the funds (47 per cent) to environmentally sustainable management of natural resources and land use.</p><p>Brazil debuted in the market with a US$2 billion sustainable bond in November 2023.

Climate change made its presence felt as temperatures rose 3 deg C or 4 deg C above what they were the last time Paris hosted the Games a century ago. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Table tennis and badminton players had to use ice packs to cool down, soccer teams took mandatory cooling breaks, and cold-water baths and air-conditioned changing rooms brought much-needed relief. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In the sustainably designed athletes' village, organisers decided not to install air-conditioning. But heatwave conditions meant sleep-deprived athletes perspired in their cardboard beds, and teams resorted to buying or renting air-conditioners anyway.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Going forward, it is only going to get worse for the Olympics. </p><p> Rising heat and vanishing snow and ice for the Winter Games will be major challenges, as well as concerns over the price tag for hosting these events. </p><p> Future hosts will also need to ensure the Games will have the lightest of environmental footprints, while leaving huge benefits for local communities long after the party has left town. </p><p> Game planThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it is aware of the climate risks and the need for the Games to be as sustainable as possible. </p><p> In October 2023, IOC president Thomas Bach said that by mid-century, only 10 to 12 nations would be able to host the Winter Games. That would mean creating a schedule to rotate the Games among them, reducing cost, particularly by not having to build gigantic new venues. </p><p> And, as part of the effort to do this, in July, the IOC simultaneously awarded the 2030 Winter Games to France (French Alps) and 2034 to the US (Salt Lake City). </p><p> A bigger headache are the Summer Games. The sweltering Tokyo Games of 2021 and, now, Paris show the traditional July to August time slot is only going to become more risky for athletes and fans. </p><p> One option is to shift the Games to later in the year. But this clashes with other big sporting events and broadcasters' programming, which is scheduled years in advance. Still, there are precedents. The 1964 Tokyo Olympics were held in October and the 2000 Games in Sydney were held in September. </p><p> In the coming decades, far fewer cities will be able to host the Summer Games because of heat. A study published in The Lancet journal in 2016 looked at the number of cities in the Northern Hemisphere that were deemed low risk based on predicted wet bulb temperatures of 26 deg C or less.</p><p> Wet bulb temperature measures how heat affects humans, taking into account the effects of humidity, air temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. </p><p> The researchers made the temperature predictions using computer climate models. </p><p> Out of 645 cities -- each with a population of 600,000 or more and deemed able to stage the Olympics -- only 33 were considered low risk and 25 of these were in Western Europe, such as Dublin, London and Oslo. In Asia, only Bishkek and Ulaanbaatar were classed as low risk. </p><p> Busting budgetsNow, who does not like a good party? The Olympics must be dazzling but not bust the budget. At least, that's the hope for Paris, as the mantra from the IOC shifts to financial responsibility and sustainable use of limited resources. </p><p> Under its Olympic Agenda 2020, the goal is to reduce the cost of bidding, allow hosts more flexibility in using already-existing sports facilities, encourage bidders to develop a sustainability strategy, measure and report emissions and figure out ways to cut carbon pollution, as well as increase transparency, such as through third-party auditing. </p><p> The use of existing sites or building temporary ones is a key focus, because in the past some of the eye-watering bills for the Olympics were due in large part to the building of vast stadiums and sports facilities that were rarely, if ever, used again. </p><p> About 95 per cent of the infrastructure being used for the Paris Games is either temporary or already in existence. This cuts emissions linked to new construction sites. And, wherever possible, most of the electricity comes from sustainable sources. </p><p> All up, Paris' emissions footprint, estimated at 1.58 million tonnes, will be about half that of the Games in London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. </p><p> But the final bill for the Paris Games could still be hefty, though less than other recent Games -- US$13.7 billion (S$18.1 billion) for Tokyo and US$23.6 billion for Rio, according to an analysis of the costs of the Summer Games by Oxford University published in May. The authors estimated Paris would cost US$8.7 billion. </p><p> S&amp;P Global Ratings said Paris would come in just under US$10 billion -- about 25 per cent over the initial budget -- still hardly cheap and a reflection of the reality of becoming a host of this massive event. </p><p> It remains a Herculean task. </p><p> But the IOC is keen to point out the larger economic benefits the Games can bring. In a May blog post, the IOC said a study by the University of Limoges in France estimated the Games will generate between EUR6.7 billion (S$9.6 billion) and EUR11.1 billion in net economic benefits in the Paris region from 2018 to 2034. </p><p> But while it can be hard to quantify the full economic benefits, one trend is clear. Since 1960, the average cost of hosting the Games has been triple the bid price, according to the Oxford University study by Dr Alexander Budzier and Professor Bent Flyvbjerg.</p><p> \"The Games remain costly and continue to have large cost overruns, to a degree that threatens their viability,\" they said. \"Cost overruns are the norm for the Games, past, present and future; they are the only project type that never delivered on budget,\" they added. </p><p> Perhaps Los Angeles will do better in 2028 -- the city turned a profit when it hosted the 1984 Games. </p><p> Brisbane will be another test case in 2032. Based on 2023 figures, the Australian federal and Queensland state governments will spend about A$7.1 billion (S$6.1 billion) on the Games, chiefly building or refurbishing sports venues and athlete accommodation. And more than 80 per cent of venues are existing or temporary.</p><p> Brisbane will also be a further test of the IOC's desire to decentralise host venues. </p><p> For instance, the 2032 Games will feature 50 sports hosted in 11 cities, mainly around Brisbane but as far north as Cairns and Melbourne in the south, taking advantage of existing stadiums and other venues. But this strategy also risks more emissions from people travelling long distances (Brisbane to Cairns is 1,700km). </p><p> LegacyOrganisers, though, hope Brisbane will have long-lasting benefits, not just better sports venues, but also better transport infrastructure. The state is spending A$7.9 billion on the Cross River Rail project in Brisbane to improve connections between the central parts of the city and Olympics venues. It is also upgrading roads and rail lines elsewhere in Queensland state. </p><p> The Beijing Olympics in 2008 helped transform the city. The building and running cost of the Games amounted to US$8.3 billion, according to the Oxford researchers.

I am glad to join you for the 7th Annual Global Research Alliance for Sustainable Finance and Investment conference, or GRASFI, at the Singapore Management University or SMU.</p><p>Fostering Credible Transition, Creating Sustainable Impact<br/><br/>Climate change is a clear and present danger for the world. This is the first time that GRASFI is gathering physically here in Asia. I hope this experience will be valuable to deepen your understanding of Asia. Asia is a big and complex region, with countries at different stages of development, and with a range of economic and social needs and resources.</p><p>On one hand, we emit about half of global emissions. These emissions are expected to grow, driven by economic and development needs, including extending electricity to rural populations.</p><p>On the other hand, Asia is rich in biodiversity, which is affected by climate change, but also offers a promising range of nature-based solutions. Asia is home to around a fifth of the world's rainforests. The waters in South-East Asia, near Singapore, harbour one of the world's most extensive seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves.</p><p>The theme of the conference \"Fostering Credible Transition, Creating Sustainable Impact\" is most apt. With the right policies, strategies, and technologies, we can pursue sustainable growth for the benefit of people and planet.</p><p>While climate change affects all states around the world, for tropical island states like Singapore, it is an existential risk.</p><p>Small island states are the first to experience the impact of climate change.</p><p>Singapore's latest National Climate Change Study projects that mean sea levels in Singapore could rise by up to 2 metres by 2150.</p><p>But climate change will set off other complex changes in the world's ecology, that ultimately impacts all of us, wherever you live.</p><p>These include tipping points in our ice sheets, seawater and forests, which could amplify and accelerate climate change.</p><p>It is critical that we address this existential challenge and avoid the tragedy of the commons. Every one of us has a stake, and everyone must do his or her part. This complex problem with multiple dimensions must be dealt with at multiple levels, with a range of policy instruments, and by mobilising a wide range of stakeholders.</p><p>At the global level, we need to forge a consensus for a sustainable and equitable model of growth.</p><p>International frameworks and agreements are the foundation of this, with the UNFCCC process and the Paris Agreement at the heart of it.</p><p>Singapore is a strong supporter of this multilateral approach, including serving as ministerial facilitators in the negotiations leading up to the Paris Agreement, and more recently on mitigation and carbon credits.</p><p>Global institutions, such as the World Bank and IMF, play important roles in mobilising climate finance. I am glad that the World Bank Group has a presence in Singapore, including an Infrastructure and Urban Hub to serve the region.</p><p>At the country level, we must do our parts to decarbonise our economies, and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>We can all contribute in our own way, regardless of our size, or our level of development. For instance, even though Singapore emits less than 0.1% of global emissions, we have set ourselves a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and a little earlier for the public sector.</p><p>To achieve this, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 - a roadmap to mobilise our industries and citizens towards sustainable growth.</p><p>When I was the Finance Minister, I introduced a carbon tax as a price signal for carbon emissions. The government has also issued green bonds We have since laid out a schedule of carbon tax levels until 2030.</p><p>The proceeds from our carbon tax will be used to help companies in Singapore decarbonise.</p><p>And under our S$28 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan, we are supporting R&amp;D into new climate technologies and solutions like sustainable building materials, carbon capture and storage, and alternative fuels like biofuels and hydrogen.</p><p>Do find out more about these projects from GRASFI participants from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and SMU, which have strong science and technology capabilities, and research programmes in several areas of sustainability.</p><p>We trust that these initiatives can enable us to boost resilience here in Singapore, and enable us to serve the region as a pathfinder and testbed for green solutions.</p><p>And at the industry level, companies will need to keep pace with greater consumer preferences for sustainable products, and emerging climate regulations like sustainability reporting and cross-border carbon taxes.</p><p>Companies can either pivot their business models and portfolios to contribute and benefit from new opportunities, or risk being disrupted by others or boycotted by consumers.</p><p>Last week, I presented an award for transformation to Sembcorp Industries, a local energy company which had pivoted from oil and gas to renewable energy. They had also achieved impressive total shareholder returns through this transformation.</p><p>As part of our wider efforts in Singapore to transform our economy - also known as Industry Transformation 2.0 - we have added two new pillars to the existing four pillars, by including sustainability and resilience.</p><p>Sustainable Finance as a Catalyst for a Greener and More Resilient Future<br/><br/>Among the many stakeholders, the financial sector plays a critical role. Significant financing is needed to accomplish these ambitions at the global, country, and industry levels. We must mobilise financial resources and allocate these effectively to meet the diverse needs.</p><p>McKinsey estimates that Asia alone needs more than US$3 trillion annually to achieve net-zero by 2050.</p><p>But public finances in many countries are stressed, especially after the COVID-19 pandemics.</p><p>To meet the needs for investment and capital, we will need to more effectively mobilise some of the estimated US$400 trillion of private capital.</p><p>Sustainable finance - the pursuit of financial returns alongside environmental and social objectives - will be a critical enabler.</p><p>As a global financial centre, Singapore hopes to play our role in advancing sustainable finance, for our region and the world.</p><p>Last year, we launched the Finance for Net Zero Action Plan, which seeks to achieve four strategic outcomes.</p><p>One, to promote consistent, comparable and reliable climate data and disclosures to guide decision making and safeguard against climate risks; Two, to build up a climate resilient financial sector with deep capabilities in risk management practices like climate scenario analysis and stress testing; Three, to support financial institutions in developing credible science-based transition plans; and Four, to promote innovative financing solutions such as blended finance and voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>Many of you here are experts and practitioners in sustainable finance. You have an impressive list of topics and speakers for the coming sessions. Let me take this opportunity to suggest three areas where academics, industry, and government can work together to advance sustainable finance.</p><p>The first area is to develop better definitions and outcome measures of sustainable finance. This reduces the risks of green washing, and helps guide companies and investors in decision-making.</p><p>Taxonomies which define sustainable activities, are the foundation of this.</p><p>I am glad that efforts are underway to align these taxonomies across jurisdictions, including between Singapore, China and the EU. This will facilitate cross-border transactions by financial institutions in these jurisdictions.</p><p>We can also work together to improve how we measure the impact of finance on sustainability.</p><p>For example, the conference paper by Ayako Yasuda and Keer Yang from UC Davis suggests that clearer labelling of sustainable finance products helps investors make better investment decisions.</p><p>Similarly, the Singapore Green Finance Institute (SGFIN) developed a corporate impact pricing model that leverages AI to analyse the impact of environmental performance on stock prices.</p><p>And the Singapore Green Finance Centre is developing an Impact Weighted Account Framework to help companies better assess the sustainability impact of their operations and investments.</p><p>These initiatives help us measure outcomes, and to channel capital into activities that are impactful.</p><p>Second, to shape regulations to facilitate sustainable finance flows, while keeping down regulatory costs to companies.</p><p>For example, we have seen an increase in sustainability disclosure regulations in many jurisdictions, with some countries looking to progressively implement the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosure standards including listed companies in Singapore from FY2025, and large non-listed companies from FY2027.</p><p>By working together, we could better develop reporting frameworks that are simple yet effective.</p><p>I am glad that the conference will examine the impact of regulation, and on ESG ratings and disclosures, over the next few days.</p><p>Good regulations can also catalyse the flow of financing to impactful causes such as energy infrastructure, and deep tech innovations to accelerate decarbonisation.</p><p>For example, in the Handbook on Scaling Up Blended Finance by the Network for Greening the Financial System, regulatory and practical barriers were often cited as obstacles to scaling up blended finance transactions in emerging markets.</p><p>Third, while definitions, outcome measures, and regulations are important, ultimately, any system is operated by people. We must therefore uplift our skills and broaden our talent base.</p><p>As part of Singapore's Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map, we will invest $35 million over the next three years to upskill and reskill our finance professionals.</p><p>This includes expanding the range of sustainable finance training courses for working professionals, undergraduate and polytechnic students.</p><p>I encourage all of us here to develop new teaching modalities to make sustainable finance more accessible. For example, SGFC leveraged SMU's teaching infrastructure to deliver executive courses, and provide a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that is open to the public.</p><p>While we do our best with our current state of knowledge, we need to recognise that sustainability, and sustainable finance is a complex and fast-evolving field. So we must continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge, and deepen the capabilities of our industry.</p><p>This will require us to bring together multidisciplinary research and real-life application, and bridge the varied fields of science, technology, economics and finance.</p><p>Academic institutions, including Centres of Excellence like the SGFC and SGFIN, can play an important role by bringing academics and industry together to study important issues such as carbon markets, climate adaptation, transition finance, and nature. Our Centres of Excellence are also crucial in ensuring that the research uncovered can be applied by industry through practice notes and whitepapers, and through training courses across the career spectrum - from undergraduate to executive and C-suite levels.</p><p>Through research networks like GRASFI, we can bring together the best minds around the world, to explore, to learn and to share.</p><p>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me conclude. Climate change is an existential challenge, and one of the most complex challenges facing humankind.</p><p>Every one of us must do his or her part, and make adjustments at the global, country, industry and personal levels.</p><p>Academic researchers and practitioners like yourselves can help guide global efforts for decarbonisation and sustainable growth in an objective and science-based manner.</p><p>We will need to push the frontiers of innovation across different fields -in science and technology to better understand climate science and to develop new solutions; as well as in economics and finance to optimise price signals and fiscal incentives; and in the social sciences to shape norms and nudge behaviours.</p><p>By bringing together experts from all over the world, GRASFI is an important platform to exchange perspectives and learn from each other's experiences.</p><p>I wish you a successful conference, and continued collaborations in this complex and critical work.

Good morning. Thank you for inviting me to the 11th annual Milken Institute Asia Summit.</p><p>2. The theme of this year's summit, \"Impactful Ideas: Purposeful Action\", resonates deeply with Singapore.</p><p>a. As a small country with neither large hinterland nor abundance of natural resources, our success has been a result of our openness to ideas, our willingness to try, and our commitment to action.</p><p>b. We will preserve and deepen these strengths as we chart the way forward for Singapore - to look for better solutions; and to take bold steps to pursue new ambitions.</p><p>3. Even as we do so, there are profound shifts in the global landscape.</p><p>4. Let me speak on three of these.</p><p>5. First, climate change.</p><p>a. This is an existential issue for the world - already, we are seeing more extreme storms, floods, wildfires and heat waves, with 2024 set to be the world's hottest year on record. I am afraid, we will set a new record every year henceforth.</p><p>b. To mitigate climate change, we need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But global temperatures are already 1.1 degrees Celsius higher and are continuing to rise.</p><p>c. The impact on economies, societies and physical geographies will be profound, unless we can quickly mobilise efforts to turn ideas on adaptation, mitigation and decarbonisation into action and fruition.</p><p>d. Singapore is keenly aware of this.</p><p>i. While we are small and only contribute 0.1% of global emissions, we have committed to do our part, to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050.</p><p>ii.We are doubling down on a number of fronts.</p><p>1.We are working with our industries to reduce their primary emissions. This includes the adoption of greener technologies as well as piloting the use of carbon capture and storage solutions.</p><p>2. We are taking steps to transform our energy mix to rely more on greener power. We have recently raised our target for low-carbon energy imports from 4 GW to 6 GW by 2035, and awarded conditional approvals to 9 projects thus far, with 5 of them advancing to conditional licences. We are also investing in nascent low-carbon energy generation pathways, such as ammonia or hydrogen.</p><p>3. We will invest in coastal protection measures to shore up our resilience against the effects of rising sea level.</p><p>iii. But our efforts alone will not be sufficient - climate change affects everyone. We must ensure that Asia, and even the rest of the world, also get to net-zero. We are therefore keen to work with institutions, industries and governments in Asia and around the world to facilitate the carbon transition, in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change.</p><p>6. Second, demographic pressure and public health.</p><p>a. Today, about 10% of the world's population is aged 65 years or older. For some countries such as Japan, South Korea, Germany and the UK, that proportion is already much higher, and set to accelerate even faster.</p><p>b. If not managed well, this could place severe strain not only on workforce growth, but also healthcare systems, pensions and social support systems. But if we do it right, we can enable our seniors to remain active and healthy for longer, contribute to society, and live life to the fullest.</p><p>c. Singapore has therefore developed an Action Plan for Successful Ageing to mobilise nation-wide efforts to turn ideas on active and healthy ageing into fruition, so that we can not only lengthen the lifespan of our seniors, but also their 'health-span'.</p><p>i. Last year, we took a further step and launched our Healthier SG strategy, marking a decisive shift from reactively caring for those who are sick to proactively preventing or delaying individuals from falling ill.</p><p>ii. We aim to anchor each resident with a family doctor, who will work with community partners and healthcare clusters to develop a personalised Health Plan to support their health journey over time, with recommended screenings, vaccinations and social activities.</p><p>iii. This is a multi-year effort that re-defines the relationship between doctors and patients, and that refreshes the partnership between healthcare providers and the government.</p><p>iv. It will require both continuity and commitment, to reap the benefits of Healthier SG to improve population health, reduce disease burden and ensure fiscal sustainability.</p><p>d. It is still early days, but we hope that Healthier SG can serve as a pathfinder and show the way to address population ageing and rising burdens of non-communicable diseases faced by many countries.</p><p>7. Third, disruptive technologies, and in particular AI.</p><p>a. Thanks to faster computing, the proliferation of big data and deep learning, the pace of technological advancements have accelerated.</p><p>b. ChatGPT is a good example of this.</p><p>i. When GPT-2 was released in 2019, it had 1.5 billion parameters.</p><p>ii. Just one year later, GPT-3 was released with 175 billion parameters, and was capable of understanding context, producing more human-like text, generating code, solving problems, and even displaying reasoning abilities.</p><p>iii. Today, GPT-4 has taken the model even further, with not just the ability to engage in language-based tasks but also process both text and images.</p><p>c. These technologies hold both promise and peril.</p><p>i. For economies like Singapore which do not have the benefit of demographic advantage, AI offers the potential to overcome both labour and productivity constraints.</p><p>ii. But at the same time, we recognise that AI has the potential to disrupt jobs and cause anxiety among workers.</p><p>iii.Without proper regulatory guardrails, there will also be fears about model quality and fair use.</p><p>d. This is why Singapore had developed its National AI Strategy and updated it last year, so that we can address risks and concerns from the potential disruptions, abuse and mismanagement of AI, while seizing the potential of AI to unlock the next frontier of economic growth.</p><p>e. We hope that this will also strengthen our value proposition as an active, constructive and reliable contributor to global AI developments, and position Singapore at the forefront of AI.</p><p>8. It is clear that public-private partnerships play a key role in turning impactful ideas into purposeful action. To capitalise on these partnerships, we must ensure that we have the right enablers in place. I will touch on four of these, namely capital; talent; standards; and international collaboration.</p><p>Capital</p><p>9. Capital is not the only pre-requisite for innovation, but it certainly is one of the most critical.</p><p>10. For example, in the area of climate change, it is estimated that Asia will require about US$1.7 trillion dollars in climate and infrastructure investment annually through to 2030. To meet the capital required, we need to catalyse green and transition finance for the region.</p><p>a. Today, there are a number of reasons why there is insufficient capital to fund such projects.</p><p>i. There may not be sufficient capacity and expertise to prepare and develop projects to a stage that is bankable.</p><p>ii. Such projects may also carry a high level of risk, especially in emerging economies with greater uncertainties.</p><p>iii. Some projects may also face long lead times to implement, and in securing the necessary permits.</p><p>b. Recognising this need, Singapore had announced last year that we will set up a new blended finance initiative - the Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, or FAST-P, with a target size of US$5 billion dollars.</p><p>i. Governments, development finance institutions, and philanthropies could provide concessional capital.</p><p>ii. Multilateral development banks can provide technical assistance.</p><p>iii.These efforts will reduce project risk and improve bankability, and we hope, catalyse multiples of private commercial capital to finance transition and marginally bankable green projects in Asia.</p><p>Talent</p><p>11. Next, we need to develop the right bench strength of talent to drive research and development. Let me illustrate this with biotech, which we believe can help unlock treatment in specific disease areas such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease, as well as in new therapeutic modalities such as nucleic acid therapy, immunotherapy and cell and gene therapy.</p><p>12. One of the key areas we have identified is drug and venture development talent, and we are taking steps to address this.</p><p>a. According to a 2022 report, we expect the talent gap in Singapore for pre-clinical biotech companies to narrow from 110 to 76 in 2032, but the gap for clinical-stage biotech firms will widen from 44 to 123 within the same period.</p><p>b. This is most critical at the management level, who can support business management activities such as fund-raising and business direction. This will require us to nurture people who not only understand the science, but also possess the know how to commercialise, raise funds and expand the business.</p><p>c. The Helix Immersion Programme is a one-year on-the-job training programme that lets biomedical research and academic professionals gain industry-relevant skills. This programme aims to place and train 100 fellows by 2025.</p><p>d. Another programme is the Innovation and Enterprise Fellowship Programme, which aims to grow the pool of talent who can support the commercialisation of deep-tech research and bring nascent technologies to market. To date, we have attracted more than 90 fellows since its launch in 2020.</p><p>e. Through these programmes, we hope to strengthen the talent pipeline in Singapore, so that we not only have a good base of research talent but also the expertise crucial to later stages.</p><p>Standards</p><p>13. Another key enabler is governance and standards. Let me illustrate this with AI.</p><p>a. Even as we push the bounds of innovation, we ought to give citizens, consumers and governments the assurance that these innovations are done in a safe, trustworthy and responsible manner.</p><p>b. This is why we had recently promulgated our Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI. This Framework aims to ensure a fit-for-purpose regulatory environment, by setting out nine dimensions - including accountability, data, trusted development and deployment, and incident reporting.</p><p>c.With this Framework, we can foster a trusted ecosystem where we can embrace AI with confidence, provide maximal space for innovation, and harness AI for the Public Good.</p><p>International cooperation</p><p>14. And last but not least, we need to reinforce regional and global cooperation.</p><p>a. We need to reinforce the shared responsibility among nations on global issues, such as on climate change, ageing and disruptive technologies that I had spoken about earlier.</p><p>b. We need to establish common goals that each of us can measure against, so that we can not only coordinate our efforts, but also nudge each other to progress.</p><p>c. We also need to evolve frameworks by which countries can work together, and provide certainty to investors and companies to catalyse the flow of capital, talent and other resources across countries.</p><p>d. The Paris Accords, for example:</p><p>i. Has allowed 195 countries to align the goal to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees, with an aspirational target of 1.5 degrees.</p><p>ii. This has formed the basis by which countries commit to Nationally Determined Contributions, their emission reduction plans and climate adaptation strategies.</p><p>iii.It also establishes a system of monitoring, reporting and verifying the actions taken by countries.</p><p>iv.Without the Paris Accords, it will be challenging for countries to pace their decarbonisation efforts, especially given that the cost implications are not trivial.</p><p>15. One specific area of cooperation which Singapore is deeply invested in is trade cooperation.</p><p>a. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, have resulted in a vicious cycle of subsidies, tariffs and export restrictions, to compete for critical minerals and technological advantage in sectors ranging from semiconductors, clean energy and telecoms to electric vehicles, AI and quantum computing.</p><p>b. This has placed tremendous strain on the multilateral trading order. As a small country that is critically reliant on trade and a stable global environment, we are very concerned about how this will impact our ability to continue doing business with the world, and for the world to trade with one another.</p><p>c. I was just in Vientiane for the ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting. Despite challenges facing the global economy, ASEAN remains a bright spot. We made good progress on a number of key agreements to strengthen regional economic integration within ASEAN and with our key partners.</p><p>i. We are on track to conclude our negotiations on the upgrade of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), by the first quarter of next year</p><p>1. It will be a high-quality, forward-looking upgrade that will advance ASEAN as an integrated market.</p><p>ii.We have also substantially concluded the negotiations for the upgrade of the ASEAN-China FTA 3.0.</p><p>1. This will further deepen economic cooperation between ASEAN and China, particularly in emerging areas such as digital economy, green economy and supply chain connectivity.</p><p>iii. Through these agreements, we can catalyse the flow of trade and investment within ASEAN and with key economic partners. This will allow us to unlock the potential of ASEAN, which is projected to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030.</p><p>d. Over the past couple of years, Singapore has participated in new plurilateral groupings that have emerged, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (or CPTPP) and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (or IPEF).</p><p>i. These are important platforms for Singapore to enlarge our network of trading partners, evolve new trade cooperation models, and establish connections with new markets.</p><p>e. We have also advocated for a 'variable geometry' approach to cooperation, by setting up open and flexible mechanisms for countries to join whenever they are ready.</p><p>i. The WTO Joint Statement Initiative on Electronic Commerce that we have convened with Australia and Japan is one such initiative.</p><p>ii.Through the JSI, we work with our co-convenors to develop global baseline rules on e-commerce. 91 WTO members are already participating in this initiative, representing more than 90% of global trade, and we continue to welcome other WTO members to join in when they are ready.</p><p>iii. At the same time, we provide capacity building and technical assistance to help more countries to be ready.</p><p>f. In this way, we can continue to strengthen the rules-based order in trade and economic cooperation, and yet open new avenues for more investments and progress in areas such as the green and digital economy.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>16. Let me conclude.</p><p>17. As we confront the transition towards a low-carbon world, address the challenges of an ageing demographic, and leverage the potentials and mitigate risks of disruptive technologies, Singapore stands ready to work with both public and private partners to brainstorm bold ideas for change and experiment with possible solutions.</p><p>18. This includes mobilising the necessary capital, crowding in the right talent, promulgating strong governance and balanced standards, and last but not least, promoting regional and global cooperation.</p><p>19. This way, we can build a more sustainable, inclusive and innovative world for growth, value creation and social uplift.</p><p>20.

Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study, or V3, produced an updated set of climate projections for Singapore and the Southeast Asia region up to the year 2100, and beyond. V3 studied the three different emission pathways of high, medium and low greenhouse gas emissions to explore the range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the Southeast Asian region.<br/><br/>2. These updated climate projections enable the Government to develop and refine our climate adaptation plans to ensure that Singapore remains resilient to the impact of climate change. Agencies involved in the Resilience Working Group include URA, NParks, PUB and NEA, which are tasked to review and update the adaption plans in their respective areas.<br/><br/>3. One example is Singapore's heat resilience efforts. Agencies including URA and NParks adopt a science-based and proactive heat resilience strategy to help Singaporeans cope with rising temperatures. a. First, we are implementing national-level strategies to cool our urban environment, such as by infusing more greenery and scaling up the use of cool materials on buildings. b. Second, we are strengthening the community's resilience to heat. For example, MSE and NEA launched the Heat Stress Advisory last year for the general population. Working with MOH, we advised the more vulnerable segments, such as the elderly and children, to exercise greater caution. MOM and MOE also issue sector-specific guidelines for outdoor workers and students respectively. c. Third, we are deepening our understanding of the science behind how rising temperatures affect Singapore and our residents.<br/><br/>4. We are investigating the impact of heat on specific population segments. We have commissioned studies under the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project to investigate the impact of heat on different segments of the population. NEA has also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impact Science Research Programme for new research proposals in areas such as food security, human health, and sea level rise.<br/><br/>5. MSE will continue to work with other agencies to better understand the effects of climate change on Singapore and our population, and put in place the necessary adaptation and risk mitigation measures. We will ensure that the built environment is resilient and prepared for a range of climate scenarios, and empower the community to take the necessary protective measures.</p><p>[Category: Energy, Regulatory and Legal]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["V3 studied the three different emission pathways of high, medium and low greenhouse gas emissions to explore the range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the Southeast Asian region. 2.

Congratulations to CDL on the opening of the Singapore Sustainability Academy Annex (SSA Annex) today.<br/><br/>I see many familiar faces here from recent events like Go Green SG and the Youth4Climate challenge.<br/><br/>The growing tempo of events is a good sign that the sustainability movement here, and around the world is picking up momentum. Today's launch is another occasion for us to gather and exchange ideas.<br/><br/>Taking Action to Address Climate Change<br/><br/>Sustainable development, especially tackling climate change, is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.<br/><br/>It is encouraging that commendable strides have been made, especially since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.<br/><br/>Improvements in technology have reduced the production costs of renewable energy significantly.<br/><br/>Various industry sectors, including building owners and real estate developers, are developing plans to decarbonise their sectors.<br/><br/>Many financial institutions and investors have also adopted sustainability targets and Net-Zero transition plans.<br/><br/>There are also many efforts to look at nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>But we need to do more and act faster.<br/><br/>According to the latest IPCC report, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels.<br/><br/>This is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 Celsius, and to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>But global emissions last year continued to rise above 2022 levels.</p><p>So we are moving in the wrong direction, including in Asia, which accounts for about half of global emissions.<br/><br/>Globally and in the region, we are seeing the results of climate change, with extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and storms.<br/><br/>Singapore is very vulnerable to climate change. Temperatures have risen steadily over the past 40 years, and rising sea levels pose existential risks for our island nation.<br/><br/>It is important that we prepare ourselves for climate change early - starting with our goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>We have put in place policies such as a carbon tax and mandatory sustainability reporting. These are not always easy for companies to adopt, and we will need to help our companies adjust.<br/><br/>We have also launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, as a national roadmap to guide sustainable development.<br/><br/>And just a few days earlier, the National Research Foundation, or NRF, launched the new CREATE Thematic Programme in Decarbonisation to help decarbonise the energy and industry sectors together with international research partners.<br/><br/>These plans and policies aim to help Singapore increase our resilience to climate change, and contribute to global efforts.<br/><br/>We hope to be a pathfinder and testbed for green solutions, and catalyse a sustainability wave in the region and beyond.<br/><br/>Partnerships to Accomplish our Sustainability Agenda<br/><br/>The agenda that I have laid out is ambitious and will require all of us to play our part.<br/><br/>As Sherman spoke earlier, CDL is leading by example to make sustainability an important pillar of your business ethos and strategy.<br/><br/>2030 and 2050 net zero targets guide your operations towards greater sustainability, and you have contributed to shaping industry practices in emerging areas such as sustainability reporting and sustainable finance.<br/><br/>CDL has also played an active role in sustainability education, and I was happy to join your initiatives like the CDL Green Gallery at the Botanic Gardens, and the 7th edition of the Youth4Climate Festival which was held in Bedok earlier this month.<br/><br/>This spirit of active citizenry is reflected in the setting up of the SSA in 2017 as a ground-up initiative and zero-energy facility dedicated to sustainability capacity building and thought leadership.</p><p>I am glad that the SSA has hosted over 1,000 events and 35,000 visitors since its launch. Imagine if every visitor here brought three good ideas, you would have collected over 100,000 ideas. And if only half of those ideas are implemented, you will have at least 50,000 good actions that are taken.<br/><br/>So congratulations to CDL, and I hope that you will inspire more companies to follow suit.<br/><br/>While such individual ground-up efforts are important, we can make even greater progress by forging partnerships with like-minded partners.<br/><br/>The challenges of climate change are multi-faceted - from understanding climate science, to changing the behaviours and preferences of everyone.<br/><br/>To innovate and tackle these challenges, we will need to bring together the multiple perspectives of experts in a wide range of areas including science, technology, business, and social sciences.<br/><br/>The SSA fosters such partnerships by providing a convenient physical space, and curating a calendar of events, to bring these stakeholders together.<br/><br/>Onsite partners like the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS), UN Global Compact Network Singapore (GCNS), World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), CDP, GRI and Ocean Geographics add additional expertise to these engagements.<br/><br/>Today, as we inaugurate the new SSA Annex, let me highlight two areas of achievements by the SSA.<br/><br/>First, the SSA has done well to raise public awareness on sustainability and mobilise collective action, by bringing together efforts across the Public, Private and People sectors.<br/><br/>For example, the Second Public Consultation for the Good Samaritan Food Donation Bill was held at the SSA earlier this year, and MP Mr Louis Ng presented his draft bill to reduce food waste for public input.<br/><br/>Similarly, talks and workshops at the SSA have helped demystify topics such as carbon accounting and reporting, the circular economy, biodiversity, decarbonisation and climate adaptation.<br/><br/>So with an expanded SSA Annex, we can expect more of such initiatives from CDL and your partners!<br/><br/>Second, SSA has helped corporates to transform and incorporate sustainability into their business models and practices.<br/><br/>Companies often have a substantial impact on the environment across their industrial processes, supply chains, and product life cycles.<br/><br/>But not all of them have the resources or expertise to understand sustainability issues, especially our SMEs.</p><p>Many companies also struggle to navigate global environmental regulations.<br/><br/>So, while companies should naturally compete in the business field, they will also benefit by working together to pool expertise and share their experiences on challenges that everyone is facing.<br/><br/>This is the spirit behind the Industry Transformation Maps or ITMs - with sustainability being a core pillar across each of the 23 ITMs in ITM 2.0.<br/><br/>We must help our companies and workers build up a strong foundation of sustainability knowledge and skills.<br/><br/>The SSA has contributed to this over the years, by hosting talks and trainings at the SSA to build capacity among our companies on green buildings, nature conservation and the adoption of sustainable energy.<br/><br/>These are conducted with partners like the Singapore Environment Council, SEAS, the Nature Society, the World Green Building Council and the Singapore Green Building Council.<br/><br/>Similarly, under the Enterprise Sustainability Programme, Enterprise Singapore works with partners like GCNS to equip companies with skills like carbon accounting and greenhouse gas management.<br/><br/>Such training courses not only allow companies to tap on expertise from qualified trainers, but also helps them network and learn from each other.<br/><br/>In turn, these new skills position our companies and workers to better seize new opportunities in a carbon-constrained world.<br/><br/>To seize such new opportunities, our focus in Singapore must go beyond training and capacity building, to working with companies to develop, innovate and scale up climate solutions.<br/><br/>These solutions can help us achieve our targets under the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, by bringing down emissions in the buildings and real estate sector, which contribute to some 20% of Singapore's carbon emissions.<br/><br/>The Green Buildings Innovation Cluster Programme, or GBIC, has been an important platform to bring together different stakeholders to innovate and develop such solutions to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings.<br/><br/>These stakeholders include our Autonomous Universities and Research Institutions, building owners such as JTC and CDL, and building solution providers like ST Engineering and Building Systems Diagnostics (BSD).<br/><br/>Under our National Research Foundation RIE 2021-25, we are devoting $28 bil to our R&amp;D efforts. One of the four big domains in our R&amp;D efforts is on Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS). Under our USS R&amp;D programme, we have a range of interesting research that is ongoing in our universities as well as in the research institutes, including how AI and sustainability could be complementary.<br/><br/>GBIC also supports the Super Low Energy Building Smart Hub, which includes a database of technologies undergoing testing in Singapore.</p><p>I had seen some examples of these low-carbon building materials and energy-efficient designs when I visited NUS's College of Design and Engineering.<br/><br/>So I encourage everyone here to contribute to our innovation ecosystem, and be part of the solution.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me conclude.<br/><br/>We need to take urgent action to reduce global emissions, and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>We must all do our part, and work together to pool our resources and expertise, and support each other to achieve our sustainability objectives.<br/><br/>So as we inaugurate this new Annex, let us use this space to:<br/><br/>i. push the boundaries of sustainability thinking;<br/><br/>ii. work together to mobilise collective action;<br/><br/>iii. help our companies transform and embrace sustainability; and<br/><br/>iv. develop innovative solutions that can be scaled to serve the region and beyond.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Sherman and the CDL team on the launch of the Annex!

Tackling heat-stress inequality will be critical for policymakers all over the world, as part of their national climate adaptation plans. </p><p> Scientific research shows that the world is headed towards more extreme heat. A national climate change study by Singapore, released last week, predicts that the city-state's mean daily temperature could rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. </p><p> Scorching days are set to become a new normal. In the last four decades, Singapore on average had 21.4 \"very hot\" days annually, when daily maximum temperatures exceeded 35 deg C. By 2100, the country is projected to experience 41 such days annually at best, and 351 at worst. </p><p> Night-time will be more uncomfortable too. Singapore has on average had 76 annual \"warm nights\" -- hotter than 26.3 deg C -- over the last 40 years. By 2100, almost every night could be a warm one.</p><p> Heat will have a great economic toll. Over 40 countries, especially those in Asia, will experience declines in their economies because of heat stress, according to a 2016 paper by the United Nations. China's gross domestic product could fall 1 per cent and Indonesia's by 6 per cent by 2030. Extreme heat could also curb annual working hours across South-east Asia, the paper said.</p><p> The social impact may be less visible, but just as dire. Low-income households would face harsher living conditions, especially those in crowded and poorly ventilated areas. Hotter homes can indirectly reinforce poverty, by making it harder for children to study and posing numerous health risks. </p><p> Indoor cooling would be the simplest solution, but remains out of reach for the poor. In the Indian city of Kolkata, air-conditioning can cost a third of a worker's monthly salary, which ranges from US$120 to US$144 a month, an analysis by The Washington Post found. In a cruel irony, those who do manage to afford air-conditioning end up blowing hot air into their neighbours' homes.</p><p> Also at risk are blue-collar workers exposed to the elements. Extreme weather is more likely to restrict low-paid and low-skilled jobs -- such as farming and heavy labour -- while those who work corporate jobs are shielded from the outdoors. Blue-collar workers may also end up working longer hours without an increase in pay, as the weather limits their productivity. Once again, this could reinforce poverty. </p><p> Governments all over the world will need to ensure that the most vulnerable segments of society are given extra support to cope with the heat.

Tackling heat-stress inequality will be critical for policymakers all over the world, as part of their national climate adaptation plans. Scientific research shows that the world is headed towards more extreme heat. </p><p>A national climate change study by Singapore, released last week, predicts that the city-state's mean daily temperature could rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Scorching days are set to become a new normal. In the last four decades, Singapore on average had 21.4 \"very hot\" days annually, when daily maximum temperatures exceeded 35 deg C. By 2100, the country is projected to experience 41 such days annually at best, and 351 at worst. Night-time will be more uncomfortable too. Singapore has on average had 76 annual \"warm nights\" - hotter than 26.3 deg C - over the last 40 years. By 2100, almost every night could be a warm one.Heat will have a great economic toll. Over 40 countries, especially those in Asia, will experience declines in their economies because of heat stress, according to a 2016 paper by the United Nations. China's gross domestic product could fall 1 per cent and Indonesia's by 6 per cent by 2030. Extreme heat could also curb annual working hours across South-east Asia, the paper said.The social impact may be less visible, but just as dire. Low-income households would face harsher living conditions, especially those in crowded and poorly ventilated areas. Hotter homes can indirectly reinforce poverty, by making it harder for children to study and posing numerous health risks. Indoor cooling would be the simplest solution, but remains out of reach for the poor. In the Indian city of Kolkata, air-conditioning can cost a third of a worker's monthly salary, which ranges from US$120 to US$144 a month, an analysis by The Washington Post found. In a cruel irony, those who do manage to afford air-conditioning end up blowing hot air into their neighbours' homes.Also at risk are blue-collar workers exposed to the elements. Extreme weather is more likely to restrict low-paid and low-skilled jobs - such as farming and heavy labour - while those who work corporate jobs are shielded from the outdoors. Blue-collar workers may also end up working longer hours without an increase in pay, as the weather limits their productivity. Once again, this could reinforce poverty. Governments all over the world will need to ensure that the most vulnerable segments of society are given extra support to cope with the heat. This may mean redesigning buildings and infrastructure in poor communities to ensure that they do not trap heat, while increasing access to cooling equipment. Employers will also need to manage their workers' heat exposure and invest in safety equipment.

So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.</p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.</p><p> Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.</p><p> In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.</p><p> Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.</p><p> While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.</p><p> Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.</p><p> For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.</p><p> Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.</p><p> Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.</p><p> One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.</p><p> This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.</p><p> Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.</p><p> Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.</p><p> \"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.</p><p> Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.</p><p> The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.</p><p> Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.</p><p> However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures.

Most of us barely give it a thought. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Yet, we depend on these grids to keep our lives ticking. They are set to expand rapidly as populations grow and economies use more electricity. They are also widening their reach to tap more green energy sources. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But what if these grids are increasingly likely to let us down'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Grids are at risk of being damaged by worsening climate impacts, especially more powerful storms and floods and more intense heatwaves and cold snaps. This can lead to outages. Without greater investment in resilience, they risk becoming a weak link. </p><p> A recent disaster in the Australian state of Victoria is a stark reminder. </p><p> On Feb 13, 2024, six high-voltage transmission towers collapsed during a powerful storm south-west of Melbourne. More than 500,000 homes and businesses lost power across the state. </p><p> The blackout was not a one-off. Similar collapses have occurred in recent years in southern Australia.</p><p> \"Climate change is increasing the risk of outages due to the increased frequency, severity and distribution of extreme weather events,\" said the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its Climate Resilience for Energy Security report released in November 2022.</p><p> \"Electricity networks are the leading cause of climate-driven outages in many countries and are considered the element of the power system most vulnerable to climate impacts,\" it says. And these outages are costly in terms of disruption to people, communications and businesses. </p><p> Grids comprise long-distance transmission lines that connect states within countries or cross national borders. The power is then channelled to the local distribution grid, which delivers power to customers. </p><p> The technology exists to make grids more resilient and is already being deployed, but it needs to be rolled out faster and at scale. The IEA says grid investment needs to double to more than US$600 billion (S$806.3 billion) a year by the end of the decade, a large portion of it in Asia. </p><p> \"There's an increasing imperative that we need to do this much faster because we just don't have time, both from a climate perspective and an ageing infrastructure perspective, which is being impacted by climate change,\" said Mr Scott Hamilton, senior adviser to Australia's Smart Energy Council, an industry-funded body.</p><p> Australia, like many nations, has to simultaneously upgrade ageing grid infrastructure as it builds thousands of kilometres of new transmission lines to connect scores of large solar, wind and battery storage projects around the country, many in rural areas, he said. It's an immense and costly challenge as the climate risks grow, bringing storms, flash floods and forest fires in their wake. </p><p> Storms, floods and fires\"These events are causing more of these impacts. It's only a matter of time until another one happens in Australia or another part of the world,\" said Mr Hamilton, an adjunct associate professor at Melbourne's Monash University.</p><p> About a quarter of global electricity networks are exposed to severe storms, and more than 10 per cent are exposed to tropical cyclones, particularly in North America, Australia and East Asia, the IEA says.</p><p> In January 2005, when storm Gudrun hit Sweden, outages in rural areas lasted up to 20 days because of damaged distribution lines, while those in urban areas with underground cabling lasted only a few hours, the IEA report said. </p><p>Swedish network operators lost around EUR250 million (S$365 million). But the broader losses to ordinary people and businesses due to the interruptions were estimated at EUR3 billion.  </p><p> Nearly half of global power networks are also exposed to fire weather conditions for more than 50 days a year -- and close to 18 per cent of the global electricity network sees more than 200 fire weather days annually, the IEA said. Australia, California and southern Europe are especially vulnerable.</p><p> Grid expectationsDespite the risks, investment in green power is charging ahead. </p><p> The United Nations COP28 climate conference in Dubai in December 2023 set the world a great green goal. Nearly 200 nations backed a target to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030.</p><p> Wiring up all this additional green power is going to require a lot of poles and wires. </p><p> The IEA said the world's electricity use needs to grow 20 per cent faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one to meet national climate goals. This means adding or refurbishing more than 80 million km of national grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid. </p><p> Rystad Energy, in a research note on Feb 15, 2024, said US$3.1 trillion of grid infrastructure investments is needed before 2030 if the world is to limit global warming to 1.8 deg C above pre-industrial levels. Under this scenario, an additional 18 million km of grid network would be needed to keep up with the growing electrification under way across cities and countries as economies expand, including new renewable energy capacity and the rapid adoption of electric vehicles and more electrical appliances. </p><p> Asia is set to contribute more than half of the global additions this decade, with China and India leading the way as the world's largest and third-largest power consumers, Rystad said. \"We predict global grid investments will reach US$374 billion this year, with China accounting for about 30 per cent of the total.\" </p><p> China is leading the world with record additions of solar and wind energy capacity and has been building long-distance transmission lines to bring that power to the heavily populated coastal hinterland. It added just over 38,000 km in each of the past two years -- that's nearly twice the distance around the planet at the Equator. </p><p> But worsening storms and floods present a growing challenge, especially at the local level. Record flooding in Zhengzhou in Henan province in July 2021 knocked out power and communications for days to the worst-hit parts of the city of 13 million people. </p><p> China has invested heavily in research and development of its grid, boosting interconnections and strengthening weather forecasting, among other key steps. </p><p> \"Electricity reliability is highly prioritised by China's government,\" said Beijing-based Ms Yujing Liu, principal, China power decarbonisation, for the Rocky Mountain Institute, a US think-tank. </p><p> But she added that more needs to be done to strengthen the much larger distribution grid at the local level, where development and investment are lacking. </p><p> In Europe, grid operators and European Union regulators are increasingly focused on climate-proofing the transmission network. The Renewables Grid Initiative (RGI), a collaboration of non-governmental organisations and European transmission system operators, is helping to promote a greener and resilient grid. </p><p> \"Over the long term, electricity grid infrastructure resilience measures can not only increase security of supply and reduce overall operation and maintenance costs, but also further contribute to climate change mitigation as the electricity grid integrates more renewable energy,\" said Dr Andrzej Ceglarz, RGI's director of energy systems. </p><p> Costs, though, remain a concern for grid operators, he said. </p><p> The EU's Trans-European Network for Energy Regulation sets out rules for cross-border energy infrastructure and promotes the integration of renewables. It also explicitly promotes the need for climate adaptation measures, which will increase the grid's resilience, Dr Ceglarz said.</p><p> For green energy investors and asset managers, a climate-proof grid is essential. Macquarie Asset Management, a major global renewable energy investor, says companies in its portfolio, including utilities, have been strengthening their networks, including using sensors, drones and geospatial technologies to anticipate and manage extreme weather events. </p><p> SolutionsOne key solution is burying power cables underground. Tokyo is doing this as part of its climate adaptation plan. </p><p>Singapore has gone one step further and built a cross-island network of transmission cable tunnels 60m below ground. Completed in 2019, the 40km network not only protects high-voltage power lines, but also makes it easier to repair and replace them. </p><p> In Finland, Elenia, the nation's second-largest power grid operator, has a long-term programme to put 90 per cent of its electricity network underground by 2036. By the end of 2023, nearly two-thirds of its 76,600km network had been buried. </p><p> This solution is generally more expensive and is not foolproof -- underground cables are vulnerable to heatwaves and construction accidents from road, telecoms and building construction. But burying power lines generally boosts reliability and reduces downtime. </p><p> Other steps include designing stronger transmission towers, more frequent visual inspections of power lines, especially those vulnerable to wildfires, and regular pruning of trees and branches as well as grass in fire-prone areas. </p><p> Traditional power lines carrying two to four wires are also vulnerable to high winds as the wires can touch each other, causing sparks. One solution is highly insulated cables that bundle the power cables tightly. </p><p> Building in redundancy is another way to reduce outages. Increasing interconnections between different parts of the grid gives operators greater chances to reroute power during emergencies. </p><p> There's another solution that means no grid connection at all: distributed renewable energy. </p><p> Power to the peopleThese are mini-grids, in which a community's electricity is generated locally from solar, wind or pumped hydro and is supported by battery storage. It's a solution for rich and poor nations alike, such as remote towns or remote islands -- or places that have never been connected to the grid. </p><p> Some Indonesian islands are shifting away from diesel-powered generation to renewable energy mini-grids, for example. </p><p> \"One of the real advantages of having a big investment in distributed energy, or community energy, is you don't really need to build these massive transmission lines,\" said Mr Hamilton. </p><p> One example is Yackandandah, a town of 2,000 people in north-east Victoria, which is close to achieving 100 per cent renewable energy generation from rooftop solar and community batteries. The project has been in development for several years and is widely supported by the community and the state government. </p><p> And it is just one of a growing number of similar projects in Australia in which communities are going green, cutting their power bills and aiming to be self-reliant for electricity. Distributed energy systems have the potential to reduce or avoid significant power network and generation costs in the years ahead, some experts say. </p><p> Missing linkFor now, though, grids will be needed to channel the energy from the many large solar, wind and battery projects being built or planned globally. These investments are a key part of cutting reliance on polluting fossil fuels that are driving climate change. </p><p> But for that to work, grids of the future must remain reliable and resilient and cope with everything that climate change can throw at them. </p><p> There's still a lot of work to do, says the IEA. </p><p> Governments need to prioritise grid investment and national adaptation strategies need to include clear action plans to strengthen the power transmission network. Weak grids will only hold back the global fight against climate change and prove very costly down the line. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Costs, though, remain a concern for grid operators, he said.

A very good morning, and welcome to the Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore (CESG) 2024.<br/><br/>2. I am excited to see so many of us gathered here today.<br/><br/>3. Over the next four days, we will welcome over 20,000 attendees and speakers from around the world to SIWW and CESG.<br/><br/>4. This year's programme recognises the importance of pursuing development in a resource- and carbon-constrained world, while adapting to the effects of climate change. It brings forth our commitment to finding solutions and seeking out opportunities amid these challenges.<br/><br/>5. At SIWW, we can look forward to a new programme pillar on climate adaptation, specifically around coastal protection and flood management.<br/><br/>6. CESG will bring together thought leaders, government officials and industry captains to catalyse solutions for a sustainable and clean environment.<br/><br/>The reality of climate change<br/><br/>7. As we gather here today, we cannot ignore the grim reality facing our planet. The Earth continues to warm, with 2023 marking the warmest year since records began in 1850. Climate change is manifesting in unprecedented weather events in cities around the world, from the record-breaking rainfall that caused extensive flooding in Dubai in April, to the scorching heatwaves blistering several parts of India recently. These extreme weather events sound a clarion call for large scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change and decisive action to protect us from its effects.<br/><br/>Building a green future amid resource constraints<br/><br/>8. The real impact of climate change reminds us that we must press on with our climate actions to keep our 1.5C goal within reach. Singapore will do our part.<br/><br/>9. In 2021, we launched the Singapore Green Plan, which charts concrete targets over the next 10 years that will position us to achieve our long-term net zero emissions aspiration by 2050. We are increasing our carbon tax rate and introducing new policies to decarbonise our economy, energy and households.<br/><br/>10. As energy consumption is the main source of carbon emissions in Singapore, we aim to transform the way we use energy, and adopt clean sources of energy to mitigate our emissions.<br/><br/>11. We are maximising solar deployment on rooftops and open spaces, such as reservoirs. In 2021, PUB completed the first large-scale floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) project at Tengeh Reservoir which has a capacity of 60 megawatt-peak (MWp). I am pleased to announce that PUB has launched a tender for its second large-scale FPV project at Pandan Reservoir. The floating solar system at Pandan Reservoir will have a capacity of 55 MWp and when completed in 2028, will generate enough solar energy to power the equivalent of 16,000 four-room HDB flats. The FPV will generate renewable energy to power PUB's operations while reducing carbon emissions that is equivalent to taking 5,800 cars off the road.<br/><br/>12. For businesses, we have the Energy Efficiency Grant to co-fund investments required to switch to more energy efficient equipment. To further accelerate the net zero transition, JTC, the government agency in charge of our industrial progress, will be launching the Decarbonisation Living Lab @ JID Innovation Call with the support of Enterprise SG today. Under this Innovation Call, businesses in the Jurong Innovation District can tap on up to $4 million of grants to trial and deploy carbon-saving solutions. The development of sustainable technologies will help reduce carbon footprint across the industry, and reinforce JTC's goal to achieve net zero emissions in its industrial areas. More details will be shared by JTC later today.<br/><br/>13. In our pursuit of sustainable development, we must lower our resource footprint. One way to achieve this is to close our resource loops and pursue better resource recovery. The successful closing of the water loop - where used water is treated and purified to produce NEWater - is a prime example in Singapore.<br/><br/>14. Building on that milestone, we are pursuing our vision of a Zero Waste Nation. We launched the Zero Waste Masterplan in 2019 to set out our goal of closing our waste loops and achieving a circular economy. I am pleased that many households and companies have joined us on our journey towards zero waste.<br/><br/>15. There has been a heartening shift towards \"reduce\" and \"reuse\". Despite steady growth in Singapore's population and economy, domestic waste generated per capita has dropped by more than 15% over the past decade, while non-domestic waste generated per $ GDP has dropped by 30% over the same period.<br/><br/>16. More households are recycling, with National Environment Agency's (NEA) survey last year showing that our household recycling participation rate increased from 64% in 2021 to 72% in 2023. However, the overall recycling rate, which includes waste from commercial premises such as factories and construction sites, decreased from 57% in 2022 to 52% in 2023, largely due to the change in the mix of waste, with the amount of construction and demolition waste which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Even so, we have observed a decline in overall recycling rates in the past decade due to structural factors. Our local recycling market is small, and we are reliant on offtakes from other countries which are dependent on factors such as freight costs and commodity prices.<br/><br/>17. Despite these challenges, we are enhancing our efforts in recycling our priority waste streams.<br/><br/>18. On food waste, we are completing the development of the Food Waste Treatment Facility at Tuas Nexus.<br/><br/>19. For packaging waste, including plastics, we are implementing the Beverage Container Return Scheme.<br/><br/>20. And we are studying how to extend the Extended Producer Responsibility approach to other types of packaging.<br/><br/>21. We are also actively seeking ways to extract more value out of our waste. Today, the primary mode of waste disposal in Singapore is mass burn incineration. We are exploring new technologies that could generate higher value products from our mixed municipal solid waste, while reducing carbon emissions.<br/><br/>22. NEA will issue a Request for Information (RFI) for alternative disposal technologies. These technologies would involve treating mixed municipal solid waste as feedstock and processing them to generate higher value products with sustainable offtake demands, compared to landfilled incineration ash. NEA will assess the information gathered on industry's interests and the commercial viability of technologies and where suitable, conduct pilot trials to evaluate the potential of expansion to full-size disposal facilities.<br/><br/>23. I invite industry partners to join us on our zero waste journey, to explore and seek out new recycling pathways and opportunities to close our waste loop.<br/><br/>Towards a sustainable and clean environment<br/><br/>24. Even as we work on these long-term initiatives, we must continue to keep our everyday environment clean. Public hygiene is the cornerstone of a clean and green environment. This is why my Ministry has designated 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene.<br/><br/>25. The environmental services industry is our critical partner in advancing public hygiene. Faced with a shrinking workforce and higher service demands, we must continue to leverage technology to raise the bar on keeping our environment clean.<br/><br/>26. Last year, NEA facilitated cleaning service company 800 Super, and technology provider Weston Robot, to trial an autonomous cleaning robot to remove flotsam on our waterways. The fully solar-powered autonomous boat, currently deployed at Sungei Seletar, improves productivity by 80 per cent. NEA intends to work with another service provider, Chye Thiam Maintenance, to expand the initiative to two more regions later this year. Do visit the NEA Innovation Pavilion at Level 1 to learn more about the robot, among other NEA innovations.<br/><br/>Adapting to the impacts of climate change<br/><br/>27. Beyond changing our practices and habits to protect the environment, it is also important for us to plan ahead to adapt to the effects of climate change.<br/><br/>28. In Singapore, our third national climate change study (V3) has projected more wet and dry extremes and accelerating increase in mean sea levels. To protect our lives and livelihood, we have undertaken significant efforts to enhance our flood and coastal resilience.<br/><br/>29. We have invested heavily in the construction of canals, drains, and reservoirs to manage stormwater runoff effectively. Where possible, we integrate them into our urban environment so that they can double up into spaces for functional and recreational purposes.<br/><br/>30. We are looking forward to the completion of the Alkaff Lake at the new Bidadari Housing Estate.<br/><br/>31. Alkaff Lake will serve two purposes. During heavy rainfall events, it becomes a stormwater retention pond for flood control, reducing the risks of flash floods to surrounding residential areas. Under sunnier conditions, it turns into a recreational space with features such as terraced wetlands and a cascading creek for residents to enjoy.<br/><br/>32. The nearby Bidadari Underground Service Reservoir will be Singapore's first to be built on low ground and will be integrated with Bidadari Park to optimise land use. It will help fortify water supply to meet the water demand of present and future Bidadari residents.<br/><br/>33. As a low-lying island susceptible to increasing sea levels, protecting our coastline is also a priority.<br/><br/>34. I will share more about our efforts at the Coastal and Flood Resilience Leaders Summit tomorrow.<br/><br/>Innovate and collaborate for a brighter future<br/><br/>35. I am hopeful that human ingenuity, which has enabled us to confront global challenges throughout history such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, will be the key to us weathering the looming challenges of climate change and resource scarcity. Innovation drives the development of novel technology, which often has the potential for widespread scalability, allowing solutions to reach and impact large populations across the globe and in some cases, even save lives.<br/><br/>36. Today, I would like to honour Professor Gertjan Medema from the KWR Water Research Institute for his significant contributions in the field of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). His innovation enabled the use of wastewater surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic which played a key role in fighting the spread of the virus in many countries. This includes Singapore, where we have recently expanded the use of wastewater surveillance to detect the presence of Zika virus. Professor Medema is the recipient of this year's Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize, and will be giving the \"Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize 2024\" public lecture later today.<br/><br/>37. Innovation is most powerful when coupled with collaboration.<br/><br/>38. I am pleased to launch the Singapore Water Center today, a partnership between Singapore and the World Bank.<br/><br/>39. Established within the World Bank Group's Singapore Office, the Centre will serve as a knowledge hub of Singapore's experience in water management, ranging from water policies to technological and innovative practices for the water sector.<br/><br/>40. We hope that the Centre will also be a valuable source of thought leadership in urban water management for the region and beyond.<br/><br/>41. The Singapore Water Center exemplifies the spirit of what we aim to achieve here at the SIWW and CESG, which is to build partnerships and provide platforms for collaboration to advance a global agenda.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>42. Ladies and gentlemen, international events such as SIWW and CESG are crucial for bringing together thought leaders, experts and practitioners from governments, academia, and industry to exchange ideas and co-create solutions. I wish everyone a productive Summit ahead, one where you will gain new insights and forge new partnerships.

The Kyoto Protocol contained binding commitments for developed countries, whose cumulative emissions have been estimated to be as high as 92 per cent of the global total.  </p><p> The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, which allows developed countries to buy carbon credits from developing countries as a way to offset their own footprint, also inspired a number of market-based innovations. </p><p> These included the Chicago Climate Exchange -- an effort championed by former US vice-president Al Gore to create efficient mitigation projects between the United States and Brazil. Though well-intended and well-funded, it ultimately failed to live up to designer expectations and closed in 2010.</p><p> Recognition of these trends led to the Paris Agreement's consensus for greater innovations and bottom-up climate pathways that would incorporate public and private finance to spur climate-friendly markets and technological innovations. </p><p> Each country meets its Paris commitments through \"nationally determined contributions\", which include setting domestic emissions reduction targets, and a shared pledge to limit emissions to \"well below\" 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels, with aspirations of 1.5 deg C.</p><p> The agreement allows for countries and the private sector to transfer carbon credits in order to accelerate decarbonisation pathways. </p><p> This spurred DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange and Standard Chartered Bank to launch Singapore's Climate Impact X -- which was designed with a mission to create credible carbon markets while incorporating broader environmental, social and governance concerns, including biodiversity and social outcomes. </p><p> The Singapore case studyThe question emerges then: Can we expect Singapore's climate policy efforts to buck historical trends elsewhere to be both durable and effective?  </p><p> There is a very good reason to believe the answer is yes. </p><p> Why? Because Singapore is quite unique in its quest, and ability, to design policies for the long term. </p><p> Let us consider three illustrative examples. </p><p> Over 60 years ago, Singapore introduced its Housing and Development Board flat system as a means to provide housing security not only to its existing population, but for future generations. </p><p> While many see this approach as an example of infrastructure-led development, the first step was an innovative policy design mix to achieve its highly durable objectives. </p><p> Great attention was given to the nitty-gritty of policy specifications, including anticipating future effects of decisions regarding applicants' age of eligibility, the kinds of loans available, and an ability to tap into Singapore's equally unique Central Provident Fund. </p><p> The long-term implications of this policy today are profound: The ability of local citizens to buy a house is much higher today in Singapore than in other major cities around the world -- greatly reducing economic anxiety than it otherwise would have been.</p><p> Turning to more recent times, Singapore's Covid-19 management, when measured by per capita lives lost, was one of the most successful examples of any country around the world. </p><p> While some saw this as a technological and epidemiological success story, what preceded was a longstanding policy and governance design, including plans for an inter-agency committee that could be invoked for any future pandemic. </p><p> It was the design and governance of this system -- including its legitimacy to make swift decisions -- that explains why Singapore was able to deploy technology to limit the spread of the disease when so many other countries, which had access to the same technology, were unable to do so. </p><p> This forward-looking expertise is also illustrated in Singapore's sophisticated policy designs for conducting monetary policy which is managed through adjustments in the \"nominal effective exchange rate\" of a pre-established currency basket rather than by interest rates. </p><p> But it was also designed with foresight to withstand currency speculators that otherwise could have threatened its viability.</p><p> Its monetary policy is also reinforced by constitutional provisions that make it virtually impossible to respond to short-term demands for expenditures that would produce harmful long-term structural deficits.</p><p>Singapore policy officials demonstrated a strong ability to design policies in ways that anticipated long-term effects -- even when, at the time, the evidence that their expectations were accurate would not show up until far too late to inform their policy mix innovations. </p><p> What lessons, then, can we learn from Singapore's approach, and my own collaborative work over the last three decades, about how to design policies that foster durable and effective outcomes'</p><p> Lessons for climate policyFirst, advances in finance, technology, and related infrastructure developments are necessary but insufficient without innovative policy levers. </p><p> In each of the Singapore cases above, policy designers unleashed smart policy mixes that fostered long-term effectiveness that otherwise could have gone in an unintended direction. </p><p> One has to look no further than the failed experiment with US social housing projects, and infrastructure projects in North America and Europe that led to social dislocation and suburban sprawl. Likewise, Covid-19 morbidity rates in the US and Europe were vastly higher than in Singapore. </p><p> Low carbon technologies might look good in isolation, but without innovative policy designs, it is just as possible that simultaneous technological innovations might produce accelerated high carbon outcomes -- such as the high energy needs associated with Bitcoin mining -- which blindsided sustainability policymakers all around the world. </p><p> Second, policy design innovations benefit from swift and widespread knowledge diffusion. </p><p> Consider how Singapore learnt from the US' failure in public housing by tweaking policy calibrations and settings, including selling HDB flats directly to individuals, rather than providing rental subsidies. </p><p>Singapore's ratcheting-up carbon tax policy reflects similar designs in other jurisdictions, including British Columbia's efforts to foster ratcheting-up that lowers carbon emissions alongside efforts to enhance public support. </p><p> Likewise, over 160 jurisdictions around the world -- including Singapore -- have developed a policy mix first developed in Germany, known as a \"feed-in tariff\", that was designed to successfully accelerate renewable energy uptake. </p><p> The question remains: How is knowledge best integrated given its diversity and complexity? </p><p> This is highly challenging as it requires bringing together sophisticated technical knowledge, largely produced within and across the Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines, with work on legitimacy, trust and good governance, which have been the focus of the social sciences in general, and the policy sciences in particular. </p><p> After all, Singapore's success on Covid-19 was not only owing to an ability to adapt to new epidemiology as the disease unfolded, but also because it enjoys high levels of trust from its citizens that their Government has the society's long-term interests in mind. </p><p> The problem is that producers of required knowledge on technical aspects of a particular problem and its solutions, and producers of knowledge relevant for generating trust and legitimacy to operate in the long run, face all kinds of difficulties in sharing knowledge among themselves. </p><p> They speak different languages, apply different methods, and do not fully understand the relevance of the other community. </p><p> As a result, there is a tendency to engage with \"like-minded\" knowledge producers, which undermines integration of all relevant forms of knowledge for generating long-term effectiveness and durability. </p><p> Third, great care must be placed on how to best nurture anticipatory policy design exercises. </p><p> We know that innovative policy mixes can emerge through multi-stakeholder policy learning dialogues that shift attention from short-term, interest-based compromises to designing policies for durability and effectiveness to solve specified problems. </p><p> The trick is how to accelerate these processes given the nature of the climate crisis. </p><p> It is well known that Singapore is an innovator when it comes to advancing finance, technology, and infrastructure for the betterment of its people and welfare. </p><p> Its innovative successes have been sources of inspiration for years as other countries seek to understand, and emulate, the Singapore miracle.</p><p> What is less known is that Singapore is also an innovator in designing policies to be both durable and effective. </p><p> If the world is to avoid the \"policy creation euphoria, implementation depression\" cycle of global climate governance, it cannot repeat business as usual by turning to climate finance, technology, and infrastructure programmes alone. </p><p> It must also draw on, and diffuse, lessons from anticipatory policy analysis capable of producing design innovations for the long term.</p><p> Benjamin Cashore is Li Ka Shing professor in public management at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) and director of LKYSPP's Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES), which emphasises policy design capacity building through research, training and dialogues.

Many countries will not have the resources to cope with the worsening impact of climate change. </p><p> The Adaptation Gap Report published in October stated that additional adaptation finance of between US$194 billion (S$260 billion) and US$366 billion a year is needed by 2030.</p><p> Finance sources come from international public finance, countries' domestic expenditure and private finance. It has been challenging to garner private finance to fund adaptation projects as these are often not profitable. </p><p> The proposed Long Island project, which will be reclaimed off East Coast Park, will not only serve as Singapore's response to the threat of rising sea levels and inland flooding, but also create up to 60,000 new homes, which will be a mix of both public and private housing. </p><p> The sea level around Singapore is expected to rise by 1m by the end of the century. When coupled with high tides and storms, this could make the Republic vulnerable to heavy flooding.</p><p> Mr Lam said during a panel discussion on Dec 9 at the Singapore Pavilion of the COP28 summit: \"Unfortunately, adaptation doesn't attract as much finance because the returns (on investments) are the prevention of losses. </p><p> \"And prevention of losses is something you don't see until the loss actually happens.\" </p><p> Multi-functional coastal protection solutions that Singapore has adopted could be viable for other cities to attract private-sector finance, he added.</p><p> To ensure more adaptation finance is given to rural communities to protect them from sea-level rise, some revenue from carbon projects involving nature-based solutions, like the planting of mangroves, can be directed to adaptation, said Mr Lam.  </p><p> Mangroves are not only coastal guardians against sea-level rise, but also huge stores of carbon dioxide, trapping the planet-warming gas in their roots. </p><p> The other panellists were Ms Hazel Khoo, national water agency PUB's director of coastal protection; Ms Meike van Ginneken, water envoy for the Netherlands; and Mr Takahiro Konami, director of international affairs office at Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.  </p><p> Ms van Ginneken pointed to the latest figures by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which found that only 9 per cent of private finance has gone to adaptation.</p><p> She suggested that the bulk of public finance be channelled to more adaptation projects, and for private finance to be used for renewable energy, which helps to mitigate climate change.  </p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had launched a US$5 billion blended finance initiative to channel finance to projects that would otherwise not be profitable, such as those in clean energy, nature-based solutions, and waste and water management.  </p><p> MAS told The Straits Times that the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership is \"not precluded\" from investing in climate adaptation projects if it meets the risk-return and climate-impact criteria for the investment themes under the partnership. </p><p> Ms Khoo said multi-functional coastal protection solutions also enable Singapore to optimise its space constraints.  </p><p> \"Beyond that, we also want to see whether we can employ nature-based solutions that can be incorporated with engineering measures so that we can enhance our marine biodiversity and natural development at the same time,\" she added. </p><p>Singapore is conducting eight islandwide site-specific studies of its coastlines to determine the most suitable coastal protection solutions for each segment. </p><p> Asked whether Singapore has plans for coastal infrastructure at each of the coastlines, Ms Khoo said: \"There are a lot of opportunities for hybrid solutions, but I wouldn't say that at this point in time, we will be able to nail down specifically what works at each segment of the coastline. </p><p> \"We are learning a lot from other countries, we have learnt from Japan and we want to see what they have done there to inspire us to similarly think about the type of approach towards nature-based solutions.\" </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["She suggested that the bulk of public finance be channelled to more adaptation projects, and for private finance to be used for renewable energy, which helps to mitigate climate change.

They include the lingering impact of the pandemic, greater economic volatility due to supply chain disruptions and inflation, as well as the existential challenge of climate change. According to the World Bank, developing countries are projected to grow just 3.9% in 2024, more than one percentage point below the previous decade's average. Developing countries are disproportionately affected by these challenges, such as how small island developing countries are especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change and extreme weather events.</p><p>These challenges have also led to a significant rollback of hard-won development gains.According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), last year, about 238 million people experienced food insecurity, an increase of about 21 million from the previous year. TheSustainable Development Goals (SDGs)Report released by the UN Secretary-General in 2023 also showed that 30% of SDG targets are stagnating or declining.</p><p>As the largest grouping of developing countries at the UN, the G77&amp;China has a unique role in contributing to solutions towards the array of development challenges that we face.We are in a position to amplify the voice of the South on these issues, and work with others within a rules-based multilateral framework to find collective solutions.In particular, we must continue our unwavering efforts towards the collective achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs remain the most critical pathway for ensuring the continued progress of developing countries. The G77&amp;China should build on the SDG Political Declaration adopted at the SDG Summit in September last year. We should also seize opportunities to do more, including at the 4thInternational Conference on SIDS and the Summit of the Future this year, which will be crucial milestones to push forward the implementation of the SDGs.</p><p>Singapore remains committed to working with fellow developing countries to achieve the G77&amp;China's priorities, particularly in four key areas.First, we need to do more to address the pressing challenge of climate change.The decision by Parties at COP28 to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems - in a just, orderly, and equitable manner - is a significant and positive development. This will come as a cost - felt more acutely by developing countries. Thus, more must be done to mobilise technology and finance in developing countries so that we may enable greater ambition while supporting sustainable development. While the developed countries must lead the way in this area, there is scope for greater South-South cooperation so that no one is left behind.</p><p>Singapore will do our part to support fellow developing countries in ways that we can make a meaningful contribution. For example,atCOP28, Singapore announced various new initiatives to support and accelerate green transition in our region and beyond. This includes the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) blended finance initiative, which aims to catalyse up to US$5 billion from concessional and commercial capital providers globally. Singapore also provides technical assistance and capacity-building courses through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which has seen close to 150,000 participants from over180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations over the last three decades. Under this programme, we have also launched theSustainability Action Package to give greater focus to the global sustainability agenda, and share best practices in climate adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Second, on trade, we welcome the G77&amp;China's longstanding commitment to an open and rules-based multilateral trading system.We also echo the G77&amp;China's concerns regarding unilateral and protectionist measures that run counter to the spirit and rules of the WTO.</p><p>Third, on technology. We thank Cuba for making Technology a priority of its G77&amp;China Chairmanship in 2023.Technological advancements offer immense opportunities for development and towards the achievement of the SDGs. However, serious and concerted efforts are required to harness the benefits of technology, including by working with global and community partners to bridge technological and digital divides, and promote greater inclusion and connectivity.</p><p>Lastly, transformation of global governance.Governments should work together to build a more inclusive global governance system, including through the reform of key global institutions, to better reflect current realities and respond to emerging challenges.The UN High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism had put forth several bold and ambitious proposals, including on repurposing of the multilateral development bank system.

We also echo the G77&amp;China's concerns regarding unilateral and protectionist measures that run counter to the spirit and rules of the WTO."]}, {"relevance_score": 48, "title": "Nature-based solutions critical to S-E Asia's adaptation to global warming", "published": "2023-09-25", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">FLOODS, droughts and chronic heat are the most pressing areas in which South-east Asian countries must prioritise adaptation investments, sustainability professionals told The Business Times.While companies need to address their physical risk exposure, greater onus is on governments to implement system-wide policy changes that integrate climate resilience into urban planning and economic development, the observers said. The effectiveness of nature-based solutions, in particular, should not be underestimated.Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first \"Global Stocktake\" synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.Adaptation measures Lubo Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re, said historical estimates show that Asia has suffered the highest flood-related economic losses. Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.Neha Bhatia, partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, also pointed out that there have been studies that estimate rising sea levels might slash between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of South-east Asia's total gross domestic product over the next 50 years in the worst-case scenario.Beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers said.Noting that nature-based solutions are not only cost-effective, but also help to drive carbon sequestration and support biodiversity well-being, Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact, said that policymakers should focus first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems.With a better understanding and valuation of the Earth's natural ecosystems, businesses will also be better able to incorporate these resources into their decision-making, such as ensuring that there are sufficient climate resilience considerations through the environmental impact assessments of new development projects, they added.Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures help to evaluate nature and biodiversity and contextualise the financial impact that businesses will feel should these resources not be managed.Hence, beyond governments, private entities also have a vested interest in investing in the conservation of these ecosystems as it protects their assets, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific climate and resilience hub.\"(We've) been getting these ecosystem services for free. </p><p>So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus\u00c2\u00a0resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.\"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.\"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much... There is just no future without investments in adaptation,\" she added.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.

Good morning everyone. I was just here earlier for the \"Women in Carbon\" breakfast so happy International Women's Day. To all of you, a warm welcome to Singapore. I really want to thank you for inviting me again for the second edition of Carbon Forward Asia.<br/><br/>2. At last year's Carbon Forward Asia, I spoke of the importance of moving the needle on climate change, and how Singapore can be a catalyst for carbon markets and international cooperation. Last week, at the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Committee of Supply (COS) debate, I also highlighted the need for Singapore to encourage trade flows in areas such as carbon credits. Collectively, we have made important strides both globally and regionally.<br/><br/>Strong Global Momentum on Climate Issues<br/><br/>3. On the global front, 2023 was significant for the completion of the first Global Stocktake (GST) at COP-28 and adoption of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience as part of the UAE Consensus.<br/><br/>4. Although there was little progress on the operationalisation of Article 6.4 at COP-28, Article 6.2 remains operational since the establishment of the rulebook at COP-26 in 2021. Countries are already engaging in Article 6.2 collaboration. Most recently, the world's first Article 6.2 transaction was completed between Switzerland and Thailand. This has set the stage for more Article 6.2 transactions to come, and we are confident many more high-quality projects will continue to come from Asia.<br/><br/>Carbon Market Developments in Asia<br/><br/>5. Asia has been actively developing international carbon markets. Allow me to update you on some of these developments.<br/><br/>a. Malaysia's Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX) completed its first carbon credit auction in March 2023.<br/><br/>b. Indonesia launched its first carbon exchange IDX, in September last year 2023.<br/><br/>c. Vietnam has announced plans to pilot a carbon trade exchange next year with full operations expected in 2028.<br/><br/>d. Thailand submitted its Premium T-VERS (Premium Thailand Voluntary Emissions Reduction Program) for CORSIA eligibility in May last year.<br/><br/>e. Bhutan became the first country to be fully integrated with Climate Action Data Trust (CAD Trust) to prevent the double counting of carbon credits. It also announced the substantive conclusion of negotiations with Singapore on a legally-binding agreement for Article 6 collaboration in Dec last year.<br/><br/>f. In January this year, Cambodia launched its operations manual for the Implementation of Article 6.<br/><br/>6. Countries are also working together for progress. In September 2023, ASEAN adopted the Strategy for Carbon Neutrality to accelerate the region's transition towards carbon neutrality. One of its goals is to develop carbon markets that are interoperable with one another and with global markets. 2023 also saw the launch of the \"ASEAN Alliance on Carbon Markets\" (AACM), the first private sector led body aiming to support the growth of both voluntary and compliance markets in the region.<br/><br/>7. We firmly believe that Asia is poised to play a pivotal role for international carbon markets, and Singapore is committed to unlock its full potential.<br/><br/>Singapore's Commitment to Carbon Markets<br/><br/>8. On the sidelines of COP-28, Singapore signed our first Implementation Agreement, or \"IA\", with Papua New Guinea on carbon credits collaboration. I am glad I can share this here, almost one year after I met with Simo Kilepa, the Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change of Papua New Guinea, who was in Singapore for the inaugural Carbon Forward Asia. The IA between Singapore and Papua New Guinea sets out a legally binding framework between two countries, to enable the international transfer of carbon credits aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.<br/><br/>9. There are three key principles undergirding the IAs which we are working on:<br/><br/>10. First, to enable high quality carbon credits projects to be developed to generate benefits for the host country in the form of sustainable development outcomes, including bringing investments and new jobs. Singapore published our Environmental Integrity (EI) criteria last year. Our Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment has also established an International Advisory Panel for Carbon Credits (IAPCC) to advise Singapore on maintaining a robust and transparent carbon market.<br/><br/>11. Second, to enable faster time-to-market. Singapore's IAs are designed to tap on existing carbon crediting programmes and methodologies. This allows us to ramp up the operationalisation of our IAs and provides more clarity for project developers. Singapore published our List of Eligible Methodologies in December for the Papua New Guinea Agreement, which includes methodologies under Gold Standard, Verified Carbon Standard, American Carbon Registry and Global Carbon Council.<br/><br/>12. Third, to support climate adaptation in host countries and also overall mitigation of global emissions. Singapore's IAs support host countries by contributing a 5% share of all authorised carbon credits towards climate adaption in these countries. We will also cancel 2% of all authorised carbon credits as an additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions (OMGE).<br/><br/>Singapore's Commitment to Green Finance/Transition<br/><br/>13. Beyond these G2G agreements, Singapore is also expending efforts to address the region's growing green and transition finance needs, which are necessary for the growth of the carbon markets.<br/><br/>14. Last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the launch of a new Transition Credits Coalition, called \"TRACTION\". This coalition of ecosystem players will help identify barriers and potential solutions to develop transition credits as a viable market solution, such as credits from the early retirement of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs).<br/><br/>15. MAS also launched a new blended finance platform called Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, or \"FAST-P\", which aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to de-risk and finance transition and marginally bankable green projects in Asia.<br/><br/>Working with the Private Sector<br/><br/>16. We need to keep innovating and improving on our existing approaches to accelerate climate action. This is not something that governments can do alone.<br/><br/>17. We need businesses and ecosystem players to continue the momentum set last year. These include companies who are innovating to support the development of carbon markets. In the last few years, we have seen innovations in areas including insurance for carbon credits, such as with carbon credit insurers Kita, and ratings agencies providing independent ratings on projects such as with Sylvera and BeZero. We are glad these companies have decided to establish a presence in Singapore.<br/><br/>18. Today, we have over 120 companies in our carbon services and trading ecosystem. We welcome the incubation of more of these businesses in Singapore and are keen to be involved in the co-creation of solutions to spur on the developments of carbon markets, especially in Asia.<br/><br/>Closing<br/><br/>19. Let's work together to continue supporting a thriving and growing carbon services and trading ecosystem to capture opportunities in a low-carbon future.<br/><br/>20. I wish the organisers a successful and fruitful event.<br/><br/>21.

I am confident that under Uganda's chairmanship, we will be able to make significant strides towards building a stronger Global South.<br/><br/>As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the G77&amp;China this year, it is timely to reflect on the strong progress that developing countries have made in human capital development over the last few decades. For example, the World Bank estimates that the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has fallen dramatically from about 50% in the 1960s to about 8.8% in 2021.<br/><br/>However, the road ahead has become more uncertain as the world faces a confluence of serious challenges. They include the lingering impact of the pandemic, greater economic volatility due to supply chain disruptions and inflation, as well as the existential challenge of climate change. According to the World Bank, developing countries are projected to grow just 3.9% in 2024, more than one percentage point below the previous decade's average. Developing countries are disproportionately affected by these challenges, such as how small island developing countries are especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change and extreme weather events.<br/><br/>These challenges have also led to a significant rollback of hard-won development gains. According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), last year, about 238 million people experienced food insecurity, an increase of about 21 million from the previous year. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report released by the UN Secretary-General in 2023 also showed that 30% of SDG targets are stagnating or declining.<br/><br/>As the largest grouping of developing countries at the UN, the G77&amp;China has a unique role in contributing to solutions towards the array of development challenges that we face. We are in a position to amplify the voice of the South on these issues, and work with others within a rules-based multilateral framework to find collective solutions. In particular, we must continue our unwavering efforts towards the collective achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs remain the most critical pathway for ensuring the continued progress of developing countries. The G77&amp;China should build on the SDG Political Declaration adopted at the SDG Summit in September last year. We should also seize opportunities to do more, including at the 4th International Conference on SIDS and the Summit of the Future this year, which will be crucial milestones to push forward the implementation of the SDGs.<br/><br/>Singapore remains committed to working with fellow developing countries to achieve the G77&amp;China's priorities, particularly in four key areas. First, we need to do more to address the pressing challenge of climate change. The decision by Parties at COP28 to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems - in a just, orderly, and equitable manner - is a significant and positive development. This will come as a cost - felt more acutely by developing countries. Thus, more must be done to mobilise technology and finance in developing countries so that we may enable greater ambition while supporting sustainable development. While the developed countries must lead the way in this area, there is scope for greater South-South cooperation so that no one is left behind.<br/><br/>Singapore will do our part to support fellow developing countries in ways that we can make a meaningful contribution. For example, at COP28, Singapore announced various new initiatives to support and accelerate green transition in our region and beyond. This includes the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) blended finance initiative, which aims to catalyse up to US$5 billion from concessional and commercial capital providers globally. Singapore also provides technical assistance and capacity-building courses through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which has seen close to 150,000 participants from over 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations over the last three decades. Under this programme, we have also launched the Sustainability Action Package to give greater focus to the global sustainability agenda, and share best practices in climate adaptation and resilience.<br/><br/>Second, on trade, we welcome the G77&amp;China's longstanding commitment to an open and rules-based multilateral trading system. We also echo the G77&amp;China's concerns regarding unilateral and protectionist measures that run counter to the spirit and rules of the WTO.<br/><br/>Third, on technology. We thank Cuba for making Technology a priority of its G77&amp;China Chairmanship in 2023. Technological advancements offer immense opportunities for development and towards the achievement of the SDGs. However, serious and concerted efforts are required to harness the benefits of technology, including by working with global and community partners to bridge technological and digital divides, and promote greater inclusion and connectivity.<br/><br/>Lastly, transformation of global governance. Governments should work together to build a more inclusive global governance system, including through the reform of key global institutions, to better reflect current realities and respond to emerging challenges. The UN High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism had put forth several bold and ambitious proposals, including on repurposing of the multilateral development bank system. We are pleased that some of these proposals have been incorporated in the G77&amp;China's input to the Pact of the Future. Singapore will continue to work closely with G77&amp;China to ensure that the Summit of the Future will deliver outcomes that benefit all, including developing countries.<br/><br/>In closing, let me reaffirm Singapore's steadfast commitment to working with fellow developing countries, to ensure that no one is left behind in our journey towards a better tomorrow.

It includes the \"sponge city\" approach to addressing storms and floods, just as it includes building coastal embankments and better drainage systems. Similarly, smart forest management, for example by building fire breaks, would seek to minimise forest fires. </p><p> These adaptation techniques do not really mitigate climate change or address the root causes of excessive greenhouse gas emissions, but they ameliorate the impact of the disasters. </p><p> A few steps, however, both mitigate and adapt, such as protecting mangroves that help to absorb carbon emissions while also slowing the fury of storms. </p><p> A sponge city is a new urban model for flood management first suggested by Chinese researchers in 2000 to combat the concrete and asphalt that prevent drainage. It makes the most of natural \"sponges\" such as trees, lakes and parks that absorb water and let it drain away safely. </p><p> Cities that have embraced this approach to some degree include Shanghai, New York and Cardiff, with their inner-city gardens, better river drainage and planted footpaths. </p><p>Singapore, too, has incorporated principles of a sponge city in its adaptation efforts, particularly integrating rainwater into city functions. The Republic's 2030 Green Plan includes elements of permeable or porous sidewalks, wetland parks and underground storage tanks. </p><p> However, unrelenting downpours starting on July 29 that inundated cities in northern China put into sharp relief the limitations of the country's innovative \"sponge city\" measures amid relentless global warming. </p><p> The case of China's  sponge cityThe deluge wreaked havoc in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, unleashing over 260mm of rain water by the morning of Aug 1. Rivers swelled, bridges crumbled and flash floods ravaged communities, exposing the fragility of infrastructure. By Aug 8, 33 lives were lost, 18 individuals were missing and nearly 300,000 people were left reeling from the impact in Beijing alone. </p><p> Vice-Mayor Xia Linmao described it as \"historically rare torrential rains\", with 60 per cent of the annual average rainfall descending within just 83 hours. </p><p> It was exactly the scenario the sponge city concept was intended to tackle -- but couldn't.</p><p> The background: China is home to 16 of the 20 global regions considered most vulnerable to climate change. It is for this reason China invested substantially in recent years to fortify climate defences. The devastating 2012 Beijing flood that claimed 79 lives spurred President Xi Jinping to champion sponge cities. </p><p> In April 2015, 16 cities were identified as inaugural sponge city pilot projects. A target was set for key features of the programme in urban built-up areas: exceeding 20 per cent by 2020 and surpassing 80 per cent by 2030. Performance evaluation reports in 2019 showed impressive progress, with 920 sq km of sponge city construction across 30 pilot cities and an investment exceeding 160 billion yuan (S$29.6 billion).</p><p> These water management designs, however, were predicated on rainfall patterns three decades before 2014. They are grossly inadequate for today's amplified impacts of climate change. </p><p> In Beijing's Mentougou district, for instance, efforts centred on controlling 75 per cent of annual run-off since 2018. This equates to rainfall of just 25.9 mm within 24 hours. Yet, the recent heavy rainfall in Beijing reached an astounding 270.2mm, highlighting that the current sponge city blueprint is ill-suited for climate change-driven weather extremes.</p><p> What happened in  Canada, MauiThe limitations of the current sponge city approach also put the spotlight on the limitations of other adaptation measures, too. </p><p> Take the deadly fires in Canada and Hawaii's Maui, for example. With more than double the previous annual record for emissions from wildfires, and the release of 300 million tonnes of carbon into the air, 2023 could easily be the worst year for forest fires in Canada's history. </p><p> The scale of devastation in Maui, from the historic district to schools and homes, is tough to fathom. </p><p> The proximate reasons for these wildfires could be lightning, the careless lighting of a match, or a campfire, but the underlying reason is unusually warm weather and lack of precipitation driven by human-caused climate change.</p><p> And regarding adaptation, there were serious managerial and engineering lapses too. </p><p> The lack of preparedness for wildfires in Canada has been known for some time, especially as disaster management agencies faced budget and staff constraints and cuts. </p><p> In Maui, there were serious gaps in early warning systems and the local capacity to get people out of harm's way. </p><p> Review of current measures is neededThe cascade of unprecedented floods and storms on the one side, and deadly heatwaves and forest fires on the other, sounds alarm bells on two fronts. </p><p> For one thing, adaptation measures need to be constantly reviewed to ensure that their engineering specifications are up to date. </p><p> The second is the realisation that all the adaptation efforts will have little effect on the loss of lives and livelihoods caused by climate change unless the root cause of global warming is addressed -- carbon emissions that continue to be pumped into the atmosphere at record rates using fossil fuels.</p><p> All the adaptation efforts, including sponge cities, will fall short unless major emitters like China, the United States, India, Japan and Russia transition successfully to a low-carbon economy. </p><p> When fires decimate Maui, the Greek islands, or Northern Canada, it is natural that all the attention is on local causes, everything from the lighting of a match to the mismanagement of escape routes. But common to all is the extreme heat and bone-dry vegetation caused by global warming resulting directly from excessive carbon emissions that trap atmospheric heat.</p><p> Effecting a meaningful shift to a low-carbon growth trajectory requires substantial resource reallocation and technological advancement, particularly in energy production and consumption. </p><p> The reality is economic and political pressures everywhere in the world prioritise disaster relief and recovery way over preventative measures. Financial incentives are also tilted to favour any means of advancing short-term economic growth at the expense of environmental and disaster protection, especially at provincial or state levels across the world. </p><p> Correcting these misplaced priorities calls for astute top-level signals and policy design, coupled with an education campaign and changed incentives aligned to the requisites of a more sustainable growth pattern.</p><p> There is great urgency in investing more financial and staff resources and revising sponge city engineering design specifications, for example, to adapt and cope better with extreme floods and storms. There is also a need to look at the big picture of mitigation and prevention. </p><p> That calls for bold policy decisions that go beyond responding to immediate risks even during a crisis, and tailoring adaptability to an escalating climatic catastrophe.</p><p> While this transition to the new reality of climate change entails financial costs, it is worth remembering that the benefits -- ranging from mitigating climate-related damages to fostering sustainable green development -- are vastly larger.</p><p> Liuyang He is a researcher at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore; Vinod Thomas is a visiting senior fellow at ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute, and a former senior vice-president at the World Bank, and author of Risk And Resilience In The Era Of Climate Change (2023).</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The pace of climate change is playing havoc with one of the key approaches to dealing with it -- that of adaptation, where societies try to adjust to the impact of changing weather patterns and other harmful effects of a warming planet.

I am delighted to join you at this evening's Gala Dinner, which is held in conjunction with the Canada-in-Asia Conferences (or CIAC).<br/><br/>2. The CIAC was made possible by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada and Universities Canada. Thank you for choosing to hold the CIAC in Singapore again. The inaugural CIAC last year sparked interesting dialogues on many topics of importance, such as trade and multilateralism, climate change, agri-food, health, and higher education. The CIAC exemplifies our shared vision to drive action to tackle the challenges facing our generation and future generations. It offers an opportunity for our business leaders, academia and government officials to deepen collaboration to address these challenges.<br/><br/>Climate Change and Food Systems: Two Inter-Connected Issues<br/><br/>3. This year, the CIAC is shining a spotlight on two complex and inter-connected challenges - climate change and agri-food security. Both issues are at the heart of much of my Ministry's work.<br/><br/>4. Climate change no longer exists in future projections. It is a reality that we are now experiencing firsthand. 2023 was Earth's warmest year on record. Canada and many regions in Asia experienced record-breaking heatwaves. Numerous cases of heat-related illnesses were reported across Asia. High temperatures and dry conditions contributed to unprecedented wildfires across Canada, leading to deaths, poor air quality, displacement of residents, and property damage.<br/><br/>5. Both our regions will suffer long-term negative consequences of climate change if we do not take urgent action. The latest climate change study from the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (or CCRS) projected that by the end of the century, Southeast Asia will experience annual mean temperature increases of 0.5 to 5.4 degrees Celsius. Canada is also expected to warm. In \"Canada's Changing Climate Report\" 1 , it was estimated that Canada will warm at a rate double that of the global rate, with projected increases of 0.8 to 6.3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Rising temperatures and other changes in weather patterns will trigger many negative effects, such as food insecurity.<br/><br/>6. Canada and Asia are major food producing regions - Canada is known for producing grains, red meats and dairy, while Asia is considered the \"rice bowl\" for the world. The production of these foods is highly sensitive to the climate. One immense concern is the loss of arable land, which reduces capacity for food production. A warmer climate brings new pests and diseases that threaten crop yield and livestock health. Extreme weather events, which are projected to increase in occurrence and intensity, exacerbate crop losses and disrupt food supply chains. One immense concern is the loss of arable land, which reduces capacity for food production. A warmer climate brings new pests and diseases that threaten crop yield and livestock health. Extreme weather events, which are projected to increase in occurrence and intensity, exacerbate crop losses and disrupt food supply chains. Our food systems need to undergo significant transformation to remain functional amidst climate change.<br/><br/>7. Food systems, however, are not mere victims of climate change. They also contribute to climate change. Currently, about a third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions result from food and agriculture. Much of these emissions arise from deforestation to avail land for farming, as well as unsustainable farming practices. Production of livestock and rice - key produce from Canada and Asia - generate high levels of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. Downstream of food production, food loss and waste contributes about half of the total emissions We could do more to reduce these emissions, by adopting climate-friendly farming practices, addressing inefficiencies in thefood chain through better matching of supply to demand, and reducing unnecessary food waste.<br/><br/>Singapore's Experiences in Climate Action and Food Security<br/><br/>8. Like Canada and many ASEAN member states, Singapore is committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. We are taking active steps to transit to a low-carbon and more sustainable future.<br/><br/>9. In 2021, we launched our Singapore Green Plan 2030, a whole-of- nation sustainability roadmap to rally bold efforts and collective action to tackle climate change. We are the first country in the region to introduce a carbon tax, to strengthen the impetus for businesses to invest in decarbonisation. This year, we raised our carbon tax to $25 per tonne and will progressively raise it further to $50 to $80 by 2030. We are undertaking a comprehensive suite of climate mitigation measures. These include greening our energy mix, by increasing solar deployment and preparing ourselves to utilise low-carbon alternative fuels such as hydrogen. We are also actively decarbonising our aviation and maritime activities. We are venturing beyond our shores and seeking out opportunities for international collaboration on renewable energy imports, green technologies and carbon credits.<br/><br/>10. We have implemented measures to protect Singapore's population from rising temperatures and sea levels. To strengthen our food security in the face of climate change, we have set a goal to increase local food production. We are pursuing efforts such as urban agriculture and novel proteins, demonstrating our dedication to a greener future.<br/><br/>Leveraging Complementary Strengths for Global Impact<br/><br/>11. Platforms like the CIAC bring value in galvanising collective action across national borders.<br/><br/>12. Climate change and agri-food security are global challenges that we cannot solve alone. We will need to work together and leverage on each other's strengths to deliver solutions with greater global impact. In September last year, ASEAN member states and Canada established the ASEAN-Canada Strategic Partnership to closely collaborate in strategic areas such as climate adaptation and mitigation, agricultural trade and capacity building in agri-food research. In particular, we noted Canada is well-positioned to be a reliable supplier of clean energy and agricultural fertilisers for Asia. Singapore and Canada are like-minded countries in climate action. We are part of the Canada-led Powering Past Coal Alliance (or PPCA), which is working to advance the transition from unabated coal power generation to clean energy. We are also members of the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership (or FCLP), which aims to reduce forest loss, increase forest restoration, and support sustainable agriculture. Singapore and Canada are part of the initial group of partners to support the Ghana Country Package under the FCLP, which will pull together financial resources from public, private and philanthropic sources to fund Ghana's plans in forest and biodiversity conservation, through innovative solutions such as blended finance and high integrity nature-based carbon credits. Products and services from Canadian climate and agri-food companies have rapid scaling potential in Asia, with its burgeoning markets and increasingly climate-conscious population. In the area of agri-food, investments have been increasing between Canada and the Asia-Pacific in both directions over the past two decades. Asia's producers are eager to transform and adapt to modern climate challenges, and will greatly benefit from Canadian investments. Additionally, there are many learning points that we can draw from Canada's culture of sustainability and responsible resource management.<br/><br/>13. Amongst participants today, we have a good mix of leaders from the climate and agri-food sectors. I encourage you to make full use of CIAC to exchange knowledge, strengthen old connections and forge new networks and partnerships.<br/><br/>14. I wish you a good Conference ahead.

Good evening. I am delighted to join you this evening at the EB Impact Charity Gala Dinner to witness the launch of the EB Impact Sustainability Education Grant.<br/><br/>The global climate crisis<br/><br/>2. At last December's COP28, the UN's annual climate change conference, the world came to a historic agreement following the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake to transit away from fossil fuels, triple renewable energy capacity, and double energy efficiency improvements globally by 2030.<br/><br/>3. However, the Global Stocktake was also a stark reminder that current efforts are not sufficient to keep us within 1.5 degrees Celsius of temperature rise. More than ever, countries realise the urgent need to step up efforts to reduce their emissions. Many countries around the world are impacted by extreme climate events.<br/><br/>4. Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. As a small and low-lying island state, Singapore is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including sea level rise. The increasing occurrence of erratic weather patterns around the world also threatens our water and food security. To better understand the impacts of climate change on Singapore, we have undertaken three National Climate Change Studies since 2007. These studies provide climate projections for Singapore and Southeast Asia until the end of this century, and shed valuable insights to help us better plan and strengthen our climate adaptation measures.<br/><br/>5. The Third National Climate Change Study, or V3, was released just last month. The bad news is, based on projections from V3, we will have to contend with more extreme climate conditions - accelerating rate of sea level rise, higher temperatures, heavier rainfalls, as well as longer and more frequent dry spells.<br/><br/>6. While end-century may seem somewhat far away, we are already feeling the impacts of climate change. 2023 was Singapore's fourth hottest year on record, and the world's warmest year on record. The impacts of climate change are very real, and we must collectively take climate action now to safeguard the well-being of our current and future generations.<br/><br/>Youths as agents of change<br/><br/>7. Our youths, as the leaders of tomorrow, play a pivotal role in shaping a sustainable Singapore. All around the world, youths are driving change.<br/><br/>8. For the first time, Singapore sent an official youth delegation to COP28, with participants identified from the Climate Youth Development Programme. The programme is an initiative co-led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), the National Climate Change Secretariat, and the National Youth Council to strengthen our partnership with the youth community in advancing climate action and sustainable development. In addition to learning more about international climate negotiations, our youth delegates hosted guests and helped to share the Singapore story at our Singapore Pavilion. They also organised programmes to profile our youth climate actions. I am heartened by their passion, and hope that their activism and commitment will inspire many more youths in Singapore to step up for sustainability.<br/><br/>9. Indeed, more youths in Singapore are emerging as agents of change to make a difference in their communities. Every positive action, no matter how small, contributes to the greater cause of environmental sustainability. Some of these youth changemakers are amongst us tonight. For example:<br/><br/>a. Ms Oh Chu Xian is the founder of Magorium, a business that transforms plastic waste into road construction material;<br/><br/>b. Ms Kong Man Jing, or more widely known as Biogirl MJ, creates accessible environmental content to educate and engage communities on climate change;<br/><br/>c. Mr Yasser Amin heads Stridy, a non-profit organisation which developed a mobile app to encourage accountability in waste cleanup efforts;<br/><br/>d. Mr Ho Xiang Tian co-founded LepakInSG, an environmental advocacy group which organises discussions with subject matter experts and members of the public on our environmental policies;<br/><br/>e. and Mr Mihir Pershad runs Umami Bioworks, a company that produces cultivated seafood using innovative production methods.<br/><br/>10. Thank you for your good work, and we look forward to your continued contributions towards our sustainability journey in your respective ways.<br/><br/>Education as a key enabler to catalyse climate action<br/><br/>11. Education is a key enabler to catalyse collective change, and our youths, equipped with the right knowledge, are an important driving force behind creating a green and resilient shared future. Under the Ministry of Education's Eco Stewardship Programme, environmental education is incorporated into the Campus, Culture, Curriculum and Community (4Cs) in our Primary, Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges to enhance our students' understanding of sustainability and climate change, and to build sustainability-conscious mindsets and habits in our younger generation. Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) partner with companies, agencies and the community on research and innovation projects in sustainability, and develop new solutions that advance the national sustainability agenda. IHLs are also investing in skills for the future so that graduates and working adults can tap on new opportunities presented by the green economy.<br/><br/>12. Corporates and organisations also play an important role in nurturing our youths to become environmental stewards. The new EB Impact Sustainability Education Grant will provide financial assistance and leadership development opportunities to selected youths in Singapore aiming to achieve a higher educational degree in a sustainability-related field. I am also happy to hear about the various initiatives under EB Impact that support our youths' sustainability aspirations. EB Impact's Sustainability Exchange is a youth mentorship-programme developed in collaboration with a wide range of partners including MSE, to enable youths in Singapore to work on real-world projects under the guidance of sustainability professionals. The programme has benefitted over 130 aspiring youths to date. I encourage more corporates and organisations to engage our youths and equip them with the relevant skills to thrive in the green transition.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>13. The need to address and mitigate the worsening impacts of climate change has never been more critical. However, it is not all doom and gloom. The world is undergoing a green transition, and this opens up new opportunities in many sectors for our youths to pursue.<br/><br/>14. Let us continue to enable our youths to become agents of change, and empower them to lead the charge and contribute actively towards our sustainability development.

I am heartened that this event is centered around the youths from the Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Programme.</p><p>2. Singapore and Japan have enjoyed a long and close friendship since establishing ties in 1966. In many ways, and at various levels, our countries have become reliable partners over the last 57 years. Our partnership has been comprehensive, substantive and mutually supportive, including through challenging times such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>3. Our economic partnership continues to grow strength-to strength. Singapore was Japan's top Asian investor and third largest source of Foreign Direct Investment stock in 2022. In the same year, Singapore was also Japan's third largest investment destination in Asia.</p><p>4. Beyond trade, our countries have expanded cooperation in areas such as renewable energy, climate change and green development. My ministry, MSE (Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment) signed two Memoranda of Cooperation with the Japanese Ministries of (i) Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and (ii) Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to enhance collaboration in food security, agri-tech, climate science and climate adaptation. These partnerships will allow both sides to learn from each other and advance our respective goals of building a more sustainable future.</p><p>5. Last year, Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry also signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) with Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to deepen cooperation in long-term emissions reduction strategies and pathways.</p><p>6. At the regional level, Japan has been a steadfast partner to ASEAN for five decades. We are like-minded and committed in supporting ASEAN, and have deepened collaboration through ASEAN-led mechanisms such as the ASEAN Plus Three, East Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional Forum and ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus.</p><p>7. Singapore has consistently supported Japan's ASEAN initiatives, including:</p><p>* Japan's Strategic Partnership for ASEAN Climate and Environment (SPACE), which was recently launched in Vientiane at the ASEAN-Japan Ministerial Dialogue on Environmental Cooperation; and</p><p>* just last week at the ASEAN-Japan Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry (AMAF) meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the ASEAN-Japan Midori Cooperation Plan was also launched to enhance food security cooperation.

At the international level, we also cooperate closely through key international platforms such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the International Maritime Organisation.</p><p>9. As we come together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Dialogue Relations this year, it is important to remember that trust and respect have been at the root of the ASEAN-Japan partnership.

These include some $2.2 billion worth of investment in the decade since 2011 to strengthen our drainage system and the establishment of a coastal and flood protection fund in 2020 with an initial outlay of $5 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Considering the stakes, it could also do more to lean into its climate adaptation strategy by \"front-loading\" the outlays on defensive structures and coping mechanisms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> For instance, shoring up coastal defence is of utmost priority, given the inexorable rise in sea levels as a result of global warming and the low-lying nature of the island. A third of Singapore, including its central business district, is less than 5m above sea level.</p><p> Another priority area is our drainage systems, which need reinforcing to withstand more intense and frequent flash floods.</p><p> Urgent attention too needs to be given to the resilience of our food supplies. Singapore is land scarce and highly dependent on imported food. This makes it vulnerable to shocks arising from crop losses in countries devastated by floods and droughts, not to mention war. Rising global temperatures are a threat to agriculture. For instance, India, currently in the grip of a killer heatwave with temperatures crossing 49 deg C in New Delhi and other places, has slapped restrictions on the export of wheat for fear of shortages ahead.</p><p> Last month, Singapore was hit with the highest temperature recorded since 1983. For densely-built up Singapore, prolonged spells of high temperatures can present health and other problems.</p><p> The government alone cannot do it all in trying to meet the many challenges arising from climate change. Greater collaboration with other stakeholders - business and civil society - is needed. Crucially, coordinated steps with neighbours are also vital for climate solutions.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;WHY SOONER IS BETTER&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Adaptation measures, such as investing in seawalls, protective land reclamation and dykes, are capital intensive and expensive. But these expenditures need to be seen alongside their rewards in the form of damage avoided.</p><p> One example is comparing the cost of constructing a seawall with the even higher losses averted from inundation, not to mention the extra value of enhanced biodiversity if the seawall was designed with that in mind.</p><p> Much of these gains from adaptation are social and environmental, for example in lives and livelihoods saved and biodiversity protected. Protecting beaches and mangrove estuaries can carry a high valuation.</p><p> It is this calculus that implicitly underlies the Government's announcement in 2019 to spend $100 billion over this century to safeguard the island from the impact of climate change. Much of the funds for climate adaptation measures goes to tackling the fallout from rising sea levels. A sum of $400 million spread over two years was set aside to upgrade drainage.</p><p> But are these measures enough? Crucial questions concern Singapore's climate adaptation plan's timing and phasing, composition, and efficiency as well as complementary steps.</p><p> Scientific reports are continuously raising the projected climate damage, one reason being the lacklustre and disappointing progress in climate mitigation globally. So, the authorities need to push the envelope further, in advancing the timing of the investments, sharpening its composition, and taking complementary measures to ensure ecological and financial sustainability.</p><p> One way is to front-load investments, that is, spend more over the next 10 years instead of waiting until the 2040s.</p><p> Clearly, there are trade-offs between investing in climate resilience and reviving the economy from Covid-19. There is merit in being flexible and looking for new technologies to lower adaptation costs. But a reason for front-loading the investments is that it is better to build resistance before the problem gets progressively worse.</p><p> Furthermore, putting a greater weight on the earlier period can also enable gains to be realised earlier and longer.</p><p> The cost of sea level defences is known to increase exponentially; in one assessment for Singapore, it went from US$0.3 million-US$5.7 million (S$416,000 to S$7.9 million) by 2050 to US$0.9 million-US$6.8 million by 2100. In this spirit, immediate outlays, including building the docks of the container terminal at Tuas more than 5m above sea level, are justified. The same could be said for installing additional pumping stations at Marina Barrage that seals off the Singapore River.</p><p> The choice of priorities for climate adaptation matters greatly. As mentioned earlier, coastal defences are vital given Singapore's geography. A project to build a barrier along 21 per cent of South Korea's coastline has shown that the benefits that accrue from building such safeguards in terms of flooding and other damage averted exceed the sizeable investment costs.</p><p> A complementary approach should be to scale up the variety of nature-based solutions that are becoming available. One example is designing seawalls that work together with natural elements such as mangroves to dissipate waves and prevent coastal erosion. It helps that Singapore has experience in nurturing mangroves in Pulau Semakau and Pulau Tekong.</p><p> Interventions are also needed to enable Singapore to withstand more intense rainfall and extreme storms. PUB, the national water agency, has made a solid start by introducing flexibility and adaptability to the drainage system. Beyond deepening and widening drains and canals, its approach incorporates solutions that slow down the flow of stormwater into the drainage system. Adopting this approach is paying off in other countries, including the Netherlands. More such innovative measures should be encouraged.</p><p> It will also be essential to co-opt the private sector and civil society as partners in the Government's efforts. Capital intensive projects, like coastal defences, with long pay-off periods will indeed require the Government's lead, but they, too, should have private sector participation. In smaller scale initiatives, local answers are best derived from societal involvement, be it ways to flood-proof subway stations or the development of green \"sponge\" areas to absorb floodwaters.</p><p> Strong collaboration with business and civil society is also crucial in finding ways to boost food security in land-constrained Singapore. For example, modern farms, such as Sky Greens, are increasingly using new technology to increase food production.</p><p> Finally, Singapore cannot go it alone in climate adaptation. Complementary actions are needed with neighbours to confront rising sea levels, sharing water and trading in clean energy. Tsinghua University projects a one-third drop in gross domestic product in Asean in the event temperatures are allowed to rise to 3.2 deg C by 2048, including from heavy agricultural losses. Singapore cannot avoid economic stress if its neighbours are battered by drought, floods and other effects of climate change. Food supply and tourism are two areas that are likely to be hit.</p><p> The Asean Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response is a modest example of regional cooperation in adaptation. Its plan for 2021-2025 sets out specific ways in which disaster agencies in member countries can better share know-how and resources in the event of floods and typhoons.</p><p> As with Covid-19, the impact of climate change does not respect national boundaries.

But this year, more so than any other year within my lifetime, there are people around the world who are suffering in conflict areas and dealing with catastrophic weather events. With so many being forced to flee their countries and the natural world in a fragile state, what could it mean to get into the holiday spirit this year? As we revel in the comfort of our homes with family and friends, I invite those who've been given the gift of privilege to contemplate how your resources can be harnessed to make the world a better place. </p><p>Whether you're curious about starting your giving journey or are an active contributor, here are five lessons I've learnt as a next-gen philanthropist.Finding your purpose takes patience and workDespite how naturally it may come to some, identifying your true calling can take time. As a child, I had the opportunity to witness my father's humanitarian work first-hand. Driven by his passion for helping others and sharing that with us, he would often take us kids out to the field. From the coastlines of the Philippines to the mountains of Thailand, I would trail after him as he interviewed villagers, conversed with aid workers and negotiated with local businesses. I saw how he channelled the fire from his poverty-stricken childhood into work that positively impacted vulnerable communities. And how, despite lacking a university degree, he relied on his resolve and passion to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, support schools and orphanages, and use microfinance as seeds of change.Even after watching my father in the field, it took me nearly eight years of exploring the ocean while scuba diving and free-diving to begin my own journey. I needed to first witness how humans are destroying the ocean and its inhabitants, to then realise that I didn't need to have a degree in marine biology or work in government to contribute towards its protection. It became clear that the only obstacle in the way of exploring the impact I could have was my own self-limiting beliefs.Good philanthropy goes beyond generosityPhilanthropy is often misunderstood as being solely tied to the depth of one's pockets. While it's true that many high-profile philanthropists are wealthy, the essence of philanthropy is far from giving a certain amount, nor is it solely about the money. Originally coined to signify the \"love of humanity\", philanthropy goes beyond generosity and is about the desire to promote the welfare of others or society as a whole. Today, good philanthropy is strategic, addresses root causes, requires commitment and collaboration, and involves systems thinking and risk-taking. True philanthropy begins with humility, and always puts the mission first.My entry into philanthropy independent of my father's started with micro grants, crowdfunding campaigns and leading ocean clean-ups. As a young person upset by the destructive trends of our world, these acts gave me a sense of agency, and the more projects I got involved in and changemakers that I met, the more experience and knowledge I accumulated to consider the wider ecosystem.Always value people and partnershipsIn a way, building relationships with non-profit partners is a bit like dating. You get to know one another, decide whether you want to commit, build an emotional connection, then journey together. And sometimes, as in the world of dating, not all experiences lead to lasting relationships. Reasons vary from misaligned values and ineffective use of funds to lack of impact, governance issues, or simply because the person you worked with in the organisation has left. People form the heart of organisations, and it's important when collaborating with non-profits to build relationships with multiple team members, while emphasising trust and respect. Today's landscape of strategic philanthropy involves engaging with various stakeholders, extending beyond non-profits and their teams to communities, governments, corporates, academia, beneficiaries and other philanthropies. Philanthropists who value people and partnerships in fostering initiatives are in a better position to scale their impact. The role of philanthropy in discovery and experimentationPhilanthropy is often referred to as \"risk capital\", and holds the potential for significant outsized impact. Tackling complex issues demands unconventional approaches and reframing what success looks like. In the realm of philanthropy, capital serves as a tool to bolster impactful programmes that lack financial viability, test innovative and early-stage initiatives that create positive social and environmental benefits, and offer seed funding to emerging entrepreneurs dedicated to solving pressing challenges.Functioning as risk capital, philanthropy assumes a distinct role alongside government and big business to address global challenges. While the size of philanthropic funding may seem insignificant next to other sources, it often has the ability to take risks that others can't, which is why its impact within the ecosystem can be outsized and transformative. The momentum for blended finance opportunities is rising where multiple stakeholders with different risk tolerances invest alongside one another in the same projects. Here, philanthropy serves as a critical catalyst to unlock large volumes of private and public sector funding to scale impactful solutions.Find like-minded communities to amplify your impact I'm grateful to be involved in amazing communities of inspiring practitioners that have helped to accelerate my journey. Two of these are the Asia Philanthropy Circle, a membership platform for Asian philanthropists to jointly grow our impact, and their Climate Collective, a close-knit community of like-minded individuals interested in learning and collaborating on climate action in Asia. With opportunities to discuss challenges and practices, these communities forged by collective dedication have sparked partnerships, nurtured personal growth and refined our giving strategies. Beyond these benefits, they provide access to a reservoir of resources and expertise. Philanthropy can be an emotional journey, so regardless of which communities you join, surrounding yourself with fellow givers not only provides a pillar of support, but also amplifies the impact of one's efforts. Embarking on your philanthropic journey may feel like a daunting task, but our broken world calls for universal collective action. Whether you seek to contribute towards education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, human rights, nature conservation, climate adaptation, animal welfare, the arts, community development, gender equality, disaster relief or the plethora of other challenges we face today, there's so much to be done. The essence of philanthropy lies not in how much we give, but in our commitment to making a difference. As the renowned author and researcher Brene Brown says: \"Leadership is not about titles or the corner office. It's about the willingness to step up, put yourself out there, and lean into courage. The world is desperate for braver leaders. It's time for all of us to step up.\" The writer is a director of Singapore-based family office Rumah Group and its philanthropic arm, Rumah Foundation</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Philanthropy can be an emotional journey, so regardless of which communities you join, surrounding yourself with fellow givers not only provides a pillar of support, but also amplifies the impact of one's efforts.

Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening.<br/><br/>2. I am delighted to join you today, to celebrate the launch of the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA).<br/><br/>3. It is remarkable that we have over 150 representatives from diverse sectors gathered here - from the financial sector, corporates, industry bodies, non-governmental organisations, and government bodies. This gathering augurs well for the future of sustainable finance - where we need partnerships and a strong ecosystem of diverse players to support the region's net zero transition.<br/><br/>Singapore: A Leading Centre for Sustainable Finance in Asia<br/><br/>4. Singapore has come a long way in sustainable finance in less than 10 years.<br/><br/>a. In 2015, the Association of Banks in Singapore launched the Guidelines for Responsible Financing.<br/><br/>b. In 2017, we saw the first issuance of a green bond by a Singapore company, City Developments Limited. This was followed by DBS.<br/><br/>c. In 2019, MAS launched the Green Finance Action Plan.<br/><br/>d. And we refreshed the plan last year, with the Finance for Net Zero Action Plan, expanding our focus beyond pure green to include transition finance. This is a recognition that greening the economy goes beyond just financing green activities.<br/><br/>5. Today, Singapore is one of the leading sustainable finance centres serving the net zero transition needs in Asia and beyond.<br/><br/>a. We are ASEAN's largest market for green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds and loans. In 2022, more than S$30 billion worth of such bonds and loans were originated from Singapore.<br/><br/>b. We have a vibrant carbon services and trading ecosystem of over 100 firms, the highest concentration in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>c. We are a key centre for climate risk financing instruments. Catastrophe bond issuances in Singapore totalled S$2.5 billion over 2021 and 2022, more than twice the total from 2018 to 2020.<br/><br/>d. We also house a vibrant sustainable finance research and talent development ecosystem, comprising centres of excellence in our universities, reputable training providers, and at least 20 Asia Pacific sustainability hubs established by financial institutions.<br/><br/>6. Singapore has also stepped up in leading change and seeding solutions. We have shaped standards and guidance, and championed innovative financing approaches for green and transition finance projects, together with international partners.<br/><br/>a. In October last year, MAS was one of the first jurisdictions to propose supervisory expectations for financial institutions to have sound transition planning processes. This can in turn, enable effective climate change mitigation and adaptation measures by their clients.<br/><br/>b. Just last month, we launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy, which many of you here contributed substantively to. The taxonomy is the world's first to pioneer the concept of a \"transition\" category, in recognition of Asia's needs. It will direct greater cross-broader capital flows to green and transition activities.<br/><br/>c. MAS also worked with the GFANZ Asia Pacific Network and other international partners to publish the world's first guidance to help financial institutions finance a credible phase-out of coal plants in Asia.<br/><br/>7. These capabilities and initiatives give us a good foundation to build on, to better serve the needs of our region in the transition to net zero. We can strengthen our contributions on three fronts - Standards, Solutions and Skills.<br/><br/>Strengthen Sustainable Finance Growth - Standards, Solutions and Skills<br/><br/>8. First, standards. Clarity and credibility in standards are foundational to a trusted sustainable finance centre. They can mitigate the risk of greenwashing and at the same time, provide greater confidence for capital to be channelled to legitimate green and transition activities.<br/><br/>a. For example, MAS issued guidelines for the disclosure and reporting of ESG retail funds in 2022, and an industry code of conduct for ESG Rating and Data Product Providers last year.<br/><br/>b. We are also working with international organisations such as the International Energy Agency to develop sectoral pathways that are contextualised to circumstances faced in Asia. With clearer science-based and region-contextualised sectoral decarbonisation pathways, financial institutions can develop strategies to capitalise on the financing opportunities.<br/><br/>9. Second, solutions. In mobilising private capital for the net zero transition, we must adopt innovative financing approaches to tackle marginally bankable or currently unbankable projects.<br/><br/>a. Blended finance is key to scale the financing needed for marginally bankable projects and solutions. Together with our partners, we announced a blended finance initiative called Financing Asia's Transition Partnership, to scale the financing for green and transition infrastructure and technologies in the region.<br/><br/>b. The carbon market is another tool to unlock financing. Here, MAS is piloting the concept of transition credits to accelerate the early retirement of coal plants in Asia. We launched the Transition Credits Coalition and two pilot projects last month to explore the unlocks needed for this potential financing avenue to complement other regional financing initiatives.<br/><br/>10. Third, skills. We need a deep pool of skilled and adaptable talent. We must therefore invest in the skills and capabilities of our people and organisations.<br/><br/>Deepening Cross-sector Collaboration through SSFA<br/><br/>a. MAS, the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) and Workforce Singapore have embarked on a Jobs Transformation Map to study the impact of sustainability on our financial sector workforce.<br/><br/>b. Preliminary findings suggest that most of the jobs must be augmented by upskilling to support changes in regulations, products, and processes to better serve their clients. In addition, new and highly specialised roles such as sustainability risk analysts, will be created.<br/><br/>c. We will share our detailed findings, and just as importantly, the key initiatives by the MAS and IBF to support the sector's upskilling, in April.<br/><br/>11. To make a difference through standards, solutions and skills, the financial sector and industry will need to come together to collaborate and leverage the deep expertise that resides in each domain.<br/><br/>12. The Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA) will be a key platform to achieve this.<br/><br/>a. In setting standards, SSFA can lead in developing industry best practices in areas such as carbon credits trading and transition finance. You will have a crucial role in channelling the industry's perspectives as standards continue to evolve.<br/><br/>b. In driving innovative solutions, SSFA can bring together financial institutions and industry sectors to identify more integrated approaches to address barriers in scaling the financing needed. For example, it can combine financing solutions from different asset classes, including risk mitigation tools, to improve the bankability of projects. This applies not only in climate mitigation, but also in financing less bankable projects related to climate adaptation and biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>c. In developing skills, SSFA can contribute to upskilling and capacity building initiatives by guiding the relevance of sustainable finance courses. This includes training courses offered by Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and other training providers. In tandem, SSFA can also promote the take-up of IBF's skills certification schemes, and organise capacity building workshops in areas not readily offered by the training providers. For example, carbon markets, taxonomy application and blended finance.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>13. Sustainable finance is a key thrust of Singapore's development as a leading international financial centre. We have made a good start and are on a promising trajectory.<br/><br/>14. Let us continue to strengthen partnerships across the financial sector and with industry to support the region's low-carbon transition. The SSFA will be instrumental in coordinating this.<br/><br/>15. Everyone here today has something to offer.<br/><br/>a.

Given the fortitude and resilience of the Japanese people, I am confident that those affected by the earthquake will recover from this stronger than before.</p><p>I had the honor of addressing the 16th JSS held in Singapore last year. It is a pleasure to be here in Tokyo to speak at this distinguished gathering again. I would like to say a few words in Japanese to express my appreciation to our Japanese friends.Thank you for inviting me to the 17th Japan - Singapore Symposium. I am happy to be able to come to Tokyo during the wonderful season when cherry blossoms bloom. (Translation: Thank you for inviting me to the 17th JSS . I am happy to be here in Tokyo, especially during this wonderful season of cherry blossoms.)</p><p>Let me also wish to express appreciation for the service of the former Singapore co-chair of the JSS, Ambassador Tommy Koh. He has made many contributions to Singapore-Japan relations over the years, including as the first and longest co-chair of the JSS since its inception in 1995. However, just as the sakura bloom beckons the coming of spring and new beginnings, this year we have Singapore's former Ambassador to US, Mr Ashok Mirpuri, as our new co-chair. I have every confidence that Ashok will build on the good work by Ambassador Koh, and advance Singapore-Japan relations further through his co-chairmanship of the JSS.</p><p>Apart from having a new co-chair, this year's JSS is special for another reason. This is the first time in five years that the JSS is being held in-person in Japan. This is an excellent opportunity to reconnect with our Japanese friends and also to reach out to the wider Japanese public and deepen mutual understanding between our two countries. I look forward to the discussion on how we can strengthen bilateral cooperation and work together regionally and globally on issues of common interest.</p><p>International Outlook</p><p>The theme of this year's JSS is \"Japan-Singapore Partnership in the Regional Architecture\". It is apt and timely. This is because the world is facing a host of interconnected challenges: strategic rivalry between the US and China; the Russia-Ukraine war; the Israel-Hamas conflict; climate change; and rapid advancement in technology, particularly in bioscience and AI. These are technological changes that require strong governance. These challenges mean that we require strong governance to deal with the accompanying risks and to ensure that the benefits are distributed fairly among economies that are already grappling with inequality and challenges to a rules-based multilateral trading system. And the list of challenges goes on.</p><p>What Japan and Singapore can do together in shaping and supporting regional architecture must be informed by our appreciation and analysis of these challenges. Among them, I would like to focus on one key challenge - the state of relations between the US and China.</p><p>The relationship between the US and China is the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world with broad implications on global security and prosperity, and an outsized impact on regional stability in Asia. Tensions appear to have eased somewhat in recent months, which is a positive sign. We are encouraged that the US and China have continued to demonstrate commitment to maintaining open lines of communication and managing their relations responsibly. But this is a journey that inevitably will be challenging and comes with twists and turns. I am sure many of you will be familiar and would have noticed the recent passage of a bill in the US with serious implications on Tiktok's operations and possibly ownership. This points to the fact that fundamental divergences remain. There is still a dearth of strategic trust between both sides. In the absence of trust, both sides will only assume the worst of each other, and this can lead to miscalculation over various flashpoints and fuel escalation. This is especially worrying for both Japan and Singapore given that both our countries have valuable and broad-ranging relations with the US as well with China, and because I believe we share the view that a world in which the US and China can co-exist peacefully and work together constructively is a safer and a more prosperous environment for us.</p><p>Our region has been fortunate to have benefited from a long period of relative peace and security since the end of the Vietnam War. One of the key enablers for this has been the US' sustained presence and leadership in Asia-Pacific. At the same time, our region has also seen significant economic growth and development, including the emergence of China as the world's second largest economy and more broadly, the rise of Asia's share of the global economy, which is remarkable in being an epochal transformation that took place amidst relatively little friction. As the rest of the world becomes much more divided and dangerous, the question is whether the long and sustained period of relative peace we have enjoyed in the Asia-Pacific can endure. If the US and China are able to cooperate in areas of common interest even as they compete in other areas, this will help to address a range of security challenges. This includes the conflicts I have mentioned earlier that are raging further afield as well as potential flashpoints like Taiwan, the East and South China Seas, and the situation on the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>In the area of prosperity, the world also needs new engines of growth and innovation to solve the challenges posed by ageing societies, inequality and climate change. Societies like Singapore and Japan, which are economically mature and also aging rapidly, experience the most pressing concerns. It is projected that those aged 65 or older will account for about 35% percent of Japan's population in 2040 while 25% of Singapore's population will be over the age of 65 by 2030. Productivity growth would have to pull more and more weight in order to maintain a good standard of living for our populations since workforce growth will be limited or even negative and with older consumer populations that have greater care needs and demands but are also more price-sensitive. A well-oiled and properly functioning multilateral trading system with as few barriers as possible coupled with flexible, resilient supply chains that reflect true comparative advantages becomes even more meaningful than ever, because we need them for sustained access to competitively priced consumer goods and services. So what can be done?</p><p>Leading economies should be pooling together their resources, and jointly focusing attention to maximise the opportunities of technology breakthroughs, for example, in AI, as well as the establishment of sound governance frameworks to minimise risks and ensure that benefits are fairly and evenly spread. And also, to arrest the trend towards a more fragmented and decoupled global system to ensure that the global supply chains are strengthened while the trading system is kept free, open and rules-based so that as many as possible can benefit. Any departure from this would mean a less prosperous and more divided world.</p><p>Japan-Singapore Partnership</p><p>This is the backdrop against which Singapore and Japan can work together to build a stronger and more stable regional architecture for a secure and prosperous future. Let me offer three recommendations for consideration.</p><p>One, given our convergence of strategic outlook and shared commitment to upholding an open and rules-based multilateral trading system, we should further strengthen our close cooperation at multilateral and regional fora. We are both members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). We also work closely at the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In fact, our countries, together with Australia, are co-convenors of the Joint Statement Initiative (JSI) on E-Commerce at the WTO. We achieved substantial conclusion of a package of global digital trade rules last year, and we hope to conclude negotiations on the JSI in 2024. I hope that continued joint efforts to strengthen multilateralism and the rules-based global order will lead to a stronger, more stable and inclusive regional architecture as well.</p><p>Two, to enhance our cooperation in the context of ASEAN-Japan relations. Japan has been a steadfast and trusted partner to the region for many decades. We thank Japan for its consistent support for ASEAN Centrality. 2023 marked a major milestone for ASEAN-Japan relations as we celebrated our 50th anniversary and upgraded relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Singapore is honoured to be taking over as country coordinator for ASEAN-Japan relations this July, for the next three years. We look forward to the further strengthening of Japan's ties with ASEAN and its contribution to the regional architecture as outlined in the 2023 ASEAN-Japan Vision Statement. Singapore believes that Japan has much to contribute to regional security cooperation based on a stable, open and inclusive regional and international order. We should also work together in other areas of mutual interest such as upgrading the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership (AJCEP) Agreement, concluding an ASEAN-Japan Air Services Agreement, and implementing tangible projects under the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo Pacific (AOIP).</p><p>Three, while Singapore and Japan already enjoy excellent and multifaceted relations, there remains much scope for us to do more. We share mutual interests on issues such as the future economy, climate change and sustainability, and energy transition. Over the years, our economic ties have been underpinned by the 2002 Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement (JSEPA), which was Japan's first ever Free Trade Agreement and Singapore's first with a major trading partner. As the JSEPA entered into force more than 20 years ago, we should explore how we can keep this agreement relevant and updated for our businesses, including by working together on the digital economy.</p><p>On climate change and sustainability, we should work towards implementing concrete initiatives arising from the August 2023 Joint Statement on climate and environmental cooperation; and Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) on climate science and climate adaptation. On energy transition, Singapore congratulates Japan for hosting a successful Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) Leaders' Summit in December, which Prime Minister Lee attended. There is much that we can do together on decarbonisation. The MOC on the establishment of a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor signed in December 2023 is one concrete example. We can also explore joint research and development on low-carbon technologies and collaboration to facilitate high integrity carbon markets aligned to the Paris Agreement such as the Article 6 Implementation Partnership initiated by Japan.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, Singapore and Japan will mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2026, which is a very significant milestone, as State Minister Tsuge had noted just now. We look forward to working closely with Japan to commemorate this anniversary not just in form but also in substance.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The JSS has always been a symbol of the enduring bonds and collaboration between our two countries. In a time where profound and pressing challenges are facing our region in general, and our two countries in particular, fora such as JSS have never been more necessary. I hope that the discussion today will yield constructive ideas and insights to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation and the regional architecture.

The draft proposal will be decided at COP28. There has, however, been contention over the World Bank's proposed role as host, and over the lack of specifics on the fund's size and who must contribute.While most South-east Asian states were relatively quiet on this issue last year, Nithi Nesadurai, director and regional coordinator at environmental non-profit Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the region's representatives are starting to get behind it given that the region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change.Carbon marketsWhile progress was made at COP27 on the Article 6 rulebook addressing double counting in carbon markets, other issues remain unresolved. </p><p>These include the treatment of legacy credits from the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol - the predecessor to the current Paris Agreement.Frederick Teo, chief executive of decarbonisation investment platform GenZero, said private sector investors are seeking clarity around both the demand of carbon credits - what the credits can be used for - and supply - what are accepted as high-quality credits.\"If you look at the recent turbulence in the carbon markets, it is all about people questioning whether or not this has impact or no impact, right? Now, (investors) are just allocating capital and investing into things. So actually, it is up to some of these multilateral organisations and governments to tell us what are the rules,\" Teo said.Echoing similar sentiments, Anjali Viswamohanan, director of policy at the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors are looking forward to the resolution of\u00c2\u00a0global carbon market rules, which will further accelerate the shift in global capital towards zero-carbon projects and provide developing economies in Asia with potential revenue opportunities in green industries and infrastructure.Mitigation and just transitionHaving a clear mitigation target will help catalyse private sector investments, said Sandeep Chamling Rai, senior adviser for global climate adaptation policy at environmental non-profit WWF\u00c2\u00a0International, although he acknowledged politics often get in the way.The outcome from the global stocktake will inform how much countries have to accelerate climate action when they submit their new climate plans - called nationally determined contributions - by 2025. If countries raise their ambitions, it would provide a signal to private investors.Central to the issue of mitigation is the use of fossil fuels. A longstanding sticking point in the final decision text of previous COPs has been whether the use of fossil fuel would be \"phased down\" versus the more ambitious \"phased out\", and it looks like this will continue at COP28.Investors are keen to see more resolve from governments on tackling the issue of fossil fuel dependence, said Viswamohanan. Expectations are slim that \"phasing out\" will take hold this year, though, especially considering COP is hosted and led this year by an oil-rich nation.COP28 president-designate Sultan Al Jaber had previously called for a \"responsible phase-down of fossil fuels\".While the phasing out of fossil fuels is not likely, the COP28 presidency's earlier call for governments to treble renewables capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030 is gaining momentum among many governments. Al Jaber has set a target of installing 11,000 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2030, which would mean a trebling of the 3,629 GW\u00c2\u00a0installed\u00c2\u00a0by the end of 2022.There is also greater recognition of the need for a \"just transition\", which refers to minimising the economic and social fallout arising from a country's energy transition.The just transition work programme was established at COP27 and it will have its first high-level ministerial roundtable at COP28.All eyes will also be on the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) inked between Indonesia and a group of developed countries comprising mostly the Group of Seven countries almost a year ago. The investment plan for the US$20 billion climate deal was just released a week before COP28 and updates to the first transactions under the JETP may be announced at the event.Scaling climate financeDiscussions are ongoing to increase the amount of money developed countries have to provide to developing countries to address their climate needs. Currently set at US$100 billion per year, it is set to increase after 2025 and COP28 will lay the groundwork for establishing a new climate finance goal. Beyond government-to-government financing, an increasing focus is the mobilisation of private-sector capital for climate transition projects.Viswamohanan said investors are looking for government climate commitments that are more robust and more ambitious.\"These high-level commitments on targets would be integral to unlock the capital that Asean requires to facilitate energy transition,\" she added.GenZero's Teo added that there is a need to shift away from viewing developed countries' financing towards developing countries as donor aid.Instead, these funds could be provided to impact-investment managers to generate commercial returns beyond merely environmental and social impact. The economic returns can then be recycled and channelled to another country.Nesadurai said South-east Asian countries should organise a high-level ministers meeting after each COP to discuss the outcome's implications on the region, and the positive actions they can take as a whole to facilitate investment flows. Decisions made at COP can then be sent directly to the Asean secretariat for implementation.This is because Asean is not represented as a bloc at COP, with the region broken up into several other negotiating blocs. Singapore, for example, is part of the Alliance of Small Island States, while Indonesia and Malaysia are part of the Group of 77 countries.Said Nesadurai: \"We have the infrastructure. Yet we are all in different blocks being dictated to by the priorities of other countries, some very large, some very small. So, we don't have an identity of our own.\"Follow The Business Times' coverage of COP28 at bt.sg/cop28</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["So actually, it is up to some of these multilateral organisations and governments to tell us what are the rules,\" Teo said.

V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6)[2].<br/><br/>2. V3 updates Singapore's national climate change projections from the previous study (V2) released by CCRS in 2015. Based on a carefully selected set of global climate models from IPCC AR6, V3 downscales[3] the projections to higher resolutions of 8km over Southeast Asia and 2km over Singapore using CCRS' customised Regional Climate Model. Compared to V2, the V3 projections incorporate improved representations and a wider range of physical processes in the global climate system, enabling more accurate simulation of our regional climate on a finer scale.<br/><br/>3. V3 uses three projected global socio-economic pathways affecting greenhouse gas emission levels to explore the possible range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by end century. These correspond to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)[4] used in the IPCC AR6. The low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) reflects a shift to sustainable development pathways with net zero targets achieved after 2050 while the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) is driven by energy intensive, fossil fuel-based development. The medium emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) takes a middle-of-the-road pathway where historical patterns of development continue throughout this century.<br/><br/>Very Hot Days and Warm Nights the New Normal by End Century<br/><br/>4. Consistent with earlier projections, Singapore is expected to become warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius by end century. Singapore's annual mean temperatures, which increased at a rate of 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade in the past 40 years, is projected to rise to 0.55 degrees Celsius per decade by end century under the high emissions scenario.<br/><br/>5. Very hot days will become more frequent. Singapore experienced daily maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius[5] 21.4 days per year on average in the last 40 years. By end century, we will see between 41 and 351 days per year on average of such high daily maximum temperatures. More warm nights where temperatures exceed 26.3 degrees Celsius are also projected. From an average of 76 nights per year in the last 40 years, Singapore could experience such warm nights most nights in the year by end century.<br/><br/>Rainfall Extremes to Intensify, Dry Periods to Get Drier<br/><br/>6. Singapore's rainfall is highly variable at seasonal time scales. By the end of century, total rainfall during the southwest monsoon dry season of June-through-August could fall significantly below the historical low of 314 mm (recorded in 1997) around once every three years. For the northeast monsoon wet season of November-through-January, the corresponding seasonal total rainfall is projected to exceed the historical high of 1507 mm (recorded in 2006) occasionally.<br/><br/>7. Extreme daily rainfall[6] is projected to increase across all seasons, with increases ranging from around 6 to 92 per cent in the inter-monsoon months of April and May. On the other hand, dry spells[7] could be more frequent and last longer, with Singapore experiencing on average one dry spell every 10 to 60 months by end of century.<br/><br/>Mean Sea Level to Rise<br/><br/>8. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario. This increase from the previous V2 projections (around 1m by end century) is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels.<br/><br/>Staying Resilient in The Face of Climate Change<br/><br/>9. Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. Singapore is doing our part, with the Singapore Green Plan. We are committed to reach net-zero carbon by 2050.<br/><br/>10. In addition, the Government takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change. The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate resilient.

In addition, MSS will be collaborating with international entities and the wider scientific community to undertake joint research using V3 data.<br/><br/>12. To deepen our understanding of the impacts of climate change, NEA today also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impacts Science Research (CISR) Programme[8] for new research proposals on food security, impacts on human health, water resources, sea level rise and impacts on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector. In December last year, eight projects were awarded under the Programme's first grant call. These projects will make use of V3 results to look into areas like the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore, changes in our tropical forest landscape, among others.<br/><br/>13.

In Asia-Pacific (Apac), however, infrastructure means much more. It is an asset class with real growth potential, underpinned by structural tailwinds of decarbonisation, digitalisation and rising prosperity of the middle class. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In particular, Apac's demographics and growth dynamics will drive demand for transport and technology infrastructure. Healthcare infrastructure also faces strong prospects as consumers increasingly prioritise healthcare spending and populations grow older.</p><p> More broadly, the region will also need sizeable investments in industrials, utilities, waste management, renewables, data centres, education services, airports, highways and railways. Developing Asia alone will require an estimated US$1.7 trillion of annual infrastructure investment to sustain its economic development and enhance climate adaptation and mitigation, according to the Asian Development Bank. </p><p> Historically, institutional investors have accessed infrastructure assets mainly through private assets, both equity and credit. Unfortunately, this is increasingly challenging with private asset valuations reaching high multiples amid rising competition from sovereign, pension, infrastructure and private equity funds. Listed infrastructure stocks now trade at effective discounts of 30-40 per cent to private infrastructure assets, while offering comparable long-term returns. </p><p> Compelling possibilities  in public marketsThus, listed investors can have access to similar cash flows with better liquidity (allowing investors to manage their cash-flow needs) and lower operating costs versus comparable private assets.</p><p> There is certainly no dearth of choice when it comes to listed infrastructure stocks across Apac. Total market capitalisation easily exceeds US$1 trillion today and is growing rapidly. The universe of infrastructure stocks includes Australia, New Zealand, mainland China, Hong Kong, India and Taiwan, with an increasing share also originating from the fast-growing South-east Asia economies.</p><p> To illustrate the breadth of opportunities in this area, we need only look at a handful of examples from different regions and sectors. </p><p> New Zealand's leading generator of geothermal electricity is on track to deliver over 20 per cent compound annual growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation and a dividend yield of over 4 per cent over the next three years. </p><p> In India, a leading listed infrastructure trust comprising 46 grid transmission lines is delivering sustainable dividend yield of about 10 per cent, with historically low price volatility relative to the broader market. </p><p> In China, a toll road operator in the country's most prosperous province, where traffic is now materially higher than before the Covid pandemic, trades at just seven times earnings and a 7 per cent dividend yield, even though the company has never reduced its dividend per share for the past 25 years. </p><p>Indonesia's dominant mobile tower company is on track to grow net profits by over 16 per cent annually and deliver a dividend yield of over 3 per cent over the next three years, while boasting a markedly under-levered balance sheet.</p><p> Listed infrastructure assets sit somewhere near the middle of the risk-return spectrum, with limited earnings volatility because they generally provide essential services and face limited competition. </p><p> Investors can choose to compile portfolios with assets that are higher and lower on the risk curve.</p><p> Mature infrastructure providers, such as regulated utilities, and electricity or gas transmission and distribution companies, display relatively lower potential risk and returns. Such investment returns are dominated by yield, while capital growth is generally more modest. </p><p> For a slightly higher potential risk and reward, investors can pursue pro-cyclical infrastructure assets, such as airports, seaports and toll roads. These are recovering at different paces following the pandemic, and should provide returns through a mix of cash yield and capital growth.</p><p> Emerging social infrastructure -- which includes healthcare, retirement and education facilities -- is also set to benefit immensely from Asia's growth story and demographic trends. As these companies are investing cash flow into capital expenditures to drive future growth, this category of listed infrastructure usually offers higher return profiles but less dividend yield. </p><p> In Apac, investors can also balance their portfolios between developed and emerging markets to suit their risk appetite. </p><p> Emerging markets such as India, China and Indonesia are set for considerably stronger economic growth in the coming years than the global average, accompanied by a boom in mass affluence, creating robust demand for various types of infrastructure and driving returns higher. </p><p> Lower risk profileInfrastructure assets in the region's developed markets of Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong benefit from their lower risk profile. This is an important consideration when investing in regulated businesses, where investors need strong government institutions and rule of law to generate stable returns.</p><p> This breadth and diversity explains why major investors are now looking beyond the private markets to take a view on infrastructure trends. As a defensive way to ride on key structural themes, such as energy transition, aspiring middle class, mobility, digitalisation and ageing, listed infrastructure in Asia-Pacific is hard to overlook. </p><p> The writer is a portfolio manager at Tribeca Asian Infrastructure Fund</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["More broadly, the region will also need sizeable investments in industrials, utilities, waste management, renewables, data centres, education services, airports, highways and railways.

This tracks well compared with other segments, given that OCBC's green and sustainable finance loans made up 9 per cent of total loans.</p><p> Giving the update two years into the launch of its SME sustainable financing framework on Tuesday (Nov 15), Goh said the growth accompanies a three times rise in the number of SMEs taking up this option with the bank on the year, to over 600 SMEs.</p><p> About 500 of the lot are Singapore SMEs, which are set to make up some 80 per cent of the S$3 billion in green and sustainability-linked loans issued. About half of these loans relate to the built environment, and another quarter relate to renewables and energy efficiency, Goh pointed out.</p><p> The rest is derived from OCBC's ventures into Malaysia and Hong Kong. In Malaysia, renewable energy, particularly solar, was the top sector, with potential for growth seen in climate adaptation projects, in light of its government's flood mitigation efforts.

This works, in part, by allowing the SMEs to \"pre-qualify\" for a loan if they passed the hoops to qualify for a sustainability-related government grant.</p><p> Goh on Tuesday said this mechanism is important as SMEs continue to struggle with having the time and the funding to get their green projects accredited. \"Truth be told, the world over, the number of consultants and service providers available to help all the big companies is not even sufficient. Leave alone to say, the number of firms who specialise or focus on serving the SMEs, this is even less,\" he added.</p><p> To capitalise on the momentum, Goh said OCBC will refine the framework to broaden access to sustainable finance to support a bigger spectrum of businesses. The framework currently covers nine sectors, with the ninth category -- climate adaptation -- added in December last year. </p><p> OCBC will also embark on more industry partnerships to extend more self-help emissions measurement and reporting tools to SMEs to help them capture data and benchmark, he said. </p><p> One such partnership with the Building and Construction Authority had led to the formation of a tool that makes it simpler and more convenient to predict and improve the energy performance of property projects and facilities, providing assessments within minutes, Goh said. Precision engineering and aerospace company Coway Engineering &amp; Marketing is a client that had utilised the tool in its application for a green commercial property loan with OCBC, he noted.</p><p> OCBC also partnered the Global Compact Network Singapore, the local chapter of the United Nations Global Compact, to create a carbon and emissions recording tool, which allows companies to compute their emissions data on energy, water and waste, and use the information to guide their plans on emissions reductions. </p><p> The bank could use such data to finance capability building or decarbonisation investments, innovations and projects, and in turn extend green loans to more businesses targeting to shrink their carbon footprint, Goh said. Engineering services company Dyna-Mac Holdings is one such client that used this tool to apply for a sustainability-linked loan with OCBC, he revealed.</p><p> With these pieces in place, Goh is also looking to grow the sustainability-linked loan segment of its sustainability financing business with SMEs.

A study in 2022 found that urban areas of Ahmedabad are 3 deg C to 4 deg C warmer than the adjacent rural areas.</p><p> Faced with so many climate-linked threats, Asia's megacities are employing a range of strategies. These range from the very simple projects, such as planting more trees, creating more green spaces and painting the roofs of homes and commercial buildings white, to complex engineering ones, such as building sea walls, subway flood barriers and deep drainage networks.</p><p> Cool roofsIn Ahmedabad, Ms Kavethiya is already feeling the benefit of her reflective roof.</p><p> On April 4, the afternoon temperature outside was 41.3 deg C, but inside her home it was a more tolerable 38.9 deg C.</p><p> \"I am thinking, this summer, I will get some relief,\" she said, hoping to put in additional work and earn more money.</p><p> While it costs around 30 rupees to paint one square foot with the reflective paint, Ms Kavethiya's household and about 160 others in Ahmedabad's Koyli Talav neighbourhood were given the paint for free by Mahila Housing Trust, an Ahmedabad-based non-profit organisation that seeks to improve living conditions for poor urban communities. </p><p> The organisation has so far deployed around 10,000 such \"cool roofs\" across the country. It is a low-carbon, low-cost cooling solution for India's less privileged communities who, despite being highly exposed to heat stress, cannot afford cooling appliances such as air-conditioners.</p><p> \"These people have to cool down somehow,\" said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, the former director of Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar in Gujarat's capital city Gandhinagar.</p><p> \"And this white paint is one of the cheaper options. Plus, it is passive, it does not require any electricity,\" he added.</p><p> The cool roof has also helped Ahmedabad resident Umaben Ashokbhai Metkel, 49, who works at home packing birthday party materials. Before her roof was painted, she found it unbearable to be in her house and could work to earn only 100 rupees a day.</p><p> Now, the heat has eased enough so she no longer suffers from dizziness as a result. She can work longer hours and increase her income to between 150 rupees and 200 rupees each day. </p><p> The paint could prove to be a key option for the poor as summers in India become more brutal. The year 2023 has been the second-warmest for India since record-keeping began in 1901.</p><p>India's meteorological department has already predicted that most of the country could be hit with above-normal temperatures and heatwaves during summer from April to June.</p><p> Low-income Indian neighbourhoods often face issues that aggravate heat-related stress. This includes overcrowding, cheek-by-jowl construction that prevents ventilation and the use of cheap but heat-trapping roofing materials.</p><p> This can cause both short-term health problems such as heat-related fainting -- which Ms Kavethiya suffered from -- and long-term ones such as cardiovascular disease.</p><p> Heat stress also reduces earnings. The latest Lancet Countdown on health and climate change estimates India lost 191 billion potential labour hours due to heat exposure in 2022. This potentially amounts to a US$219 billion (S$298 billion) income loss in 2022, equivalent to 6.3 per cent of India's gross domestic product.</p><p> In 2010, Ahmedabad experienced one of its worst heatwaves, leading to an additional 1,344 deaths in May that year, compared with the mean of figures from corresponding periods in May 2009 and 2011. Reasons for these additional deaths included heat-induced dehydration, cardiac disease and respiratory issues.</p><p> The sudden surge in fatalities compelled the authorities to work on a heat action plan, which was launched in 2013 to reduce deaths from heat-related stress.</p><p> The plan, the first such initiative in South Asia, includes a colour-coded early warning heat alert system for the city's officials. This sets in motion wide-ranging measures, such as strategically deployed ambulances, the delivery of drinking water to poorer areas, and the distribution of public awareness materials to teach residents how to cope with heat stress. </p><p> The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, together with civil society organisations, has also put in place simple but effective measures such as having drinking water stations in public spots and enhancing the city's green cover. There are also oral rehydration corners at primary health centres, which are stocked with rehydration sachets and supplements for people showing signs of dehydration.</p><p> An estimated 1,190 deaths have been prevented each year since the heat action plan was put in place.</p><p> Mahila Housing Trust is trying to partner with more local municipal bodies and corporates to support a wider roll-out of its cool roofs across the nation, a step that could save more lives. </p><p> AI-powered park in SydneyIn wealthier cities such as Sydney and Tokyo, heat is also a growing problem. Communities are tackling this by creating cool zones, using special paints on roads and pavements, and making better use of green spaces, among other measures.</p><p> In western Sydney, temperatures can exceed 40 deg C in summer, far hotter than the coastal eastern parts of the city 20km or more away. It does not help that swathes of western Sydney's more rapidly growing suburbia also have dark roofs and less greenery, although local councils are trying to address the situation.</p><p> Sweltering Cities, an Australian not-for-profit organisation formed in 2020, works with communities across Australia to advocate for community-based solutions to rising suburban temperatures. It has led a campaign for sheltered bus stops in western Sydney and is pushing for a ban on dark roofs, which cause hotter homes by trapping heat rather than reflecting it.</p><p>Ms Emma Bacon, the organisation's founder and executive director, said the group formed after it became clear a growing number of residents in western Sydney were reporting they could not walk down the streets due to the heat or could not take their children to the playground because of a lack of shade.</p><p> \"We have these large suburban areas with hardly any trees, lots of concrete, and new developments with no spaces on the street for trees,\" she added.</p><p> \"Often people feel the heat is an individual problem. But these are problems that affect hundreds of thousands or millions of people at once. There needs to be a community voice for finding solutions.\"</p><p> One project holds the promise of a network of cooling parks, helped by artificial intelligence (AI) controlling the irrigation system.</p><p> During a hot, early autumn day at Bicentennial Park in western Sydney on April 7, the afternoon sun was blazing, but finding the coolest spot in the park was refreshingly simple.</p><p> This 42ha park, billed as the world's largest data-based urban cooling project, has an app that indicates, in real-time, the hottest and coolest spots there.</p><p> On April 7, the coolest spot -- at 26.4 deg C -- was a large, shady patch of grass, surrounded by a circle of native vegetation and fanned by a gentle breeze. The hottest spot, closer to 28 deg C, was about a kilometre away, on an exposed hillside that faced the sun.</p><p> In reality, the difference in heat between the two spots seemed much starker, because the app is based on air temperature rather than the \"feels like\" temperature, which also takes into account humidity, solar radiation and wind.</p><p> But this park does much more than guide visitors to the coolest spot for a picnic. Its main role is to use technology to keep the park's temperatures as cool as possible and to push cooler air into the surrounding high-density residential and business areas.</p><p> 'Natural air-conditioning'The director of the project, Professor Sebastian Pfautsch, said that increased urban development and climate change were causing sharp rises in temperatures in western Sydney.</p><p> The aim of the park project was to adapt to this heat by \"turning the park into a natural air-conditioning system\", said the professor of urban planning and management at Western Sydney University.</p><p> \"In this densely populated part of Australia, you cannot mitigate the heat, but you can adapt,\" he added.</p><p> The project, known as SIMPaCT (Smart Irrigation Management for Parks and Cool Towns), uses AI and smart technology to monitor temperatures and weather conditions to direct the park's irrigation. It relies on soil moisture and air temperature data collected from 50 temperature and humidity sensors, 200 soil devices and 13 weather stations scattered throughout the park.</p><p> The data is then applied to a digital model of the park, which considers its undulations, vegetation and surface types, as well as official weather forecasts, to determine how and where to provide irrigation across the park's 200 irrigation zones. The park's irrigation algorithm is also constantly incorporating data on how previous irrigation methods have fared.</p><p> \"We store data about decisions made in the past, so the algorithm can learn from its decisions about the best ways to irrigate the park and keep a threshold of soil moisture,\" Prof Pfautsch said.</p><p> \"Normally, in extreme weather, plants and trees don't have enough water and basically shut down. We hydrate them so that they transpire at maximum rates to cool the park at the maximum level possible.\"</p><p> Transpiration, the evaporation of water from a plant, can help cool the surrounding environment. As the moisture evaporates from the leaves, heat is removed from the air, providing a cooling effect.</p><p> Prof Pfautsch added: \"Cool air also travels downwind, and this cools the surrounding area and reduces the electricity demand.\"</p><p> The park is estimated to be able to send air that is 3 deg C to 4 deg C cooler than surrounding temperatures about 600m into the neighbouring residential and business districts.</p><p> The project is crucial for an area such as western Sydney.</p><p> Though Australia is known for its disasters such as bushfires, floods and drought, more residents die from heatwaves than any other natural hazard. About 700 people are hospitalised and 29 die each year from heat-related conditions such as cardiac arrest or organ damage.</p><p> Residents in Sydney's western area are particularly vulnerable. The area has a fast-growing population -- which is due to grow from 2.7 million today to 3.2 million by 2036 -- but it already experiences temperatures about 6 deg C to 10 deg C higher than coastal suburbs during heatwaves.</p><p> According to a report released in March by the Committee for Sydney, heatwaves cost western Sydney's businesses and residents A$1.4 billion (S$1.24 billion) a year, based on extra cooling costs, productivity losses and health costs, and this amount is due to rise to A$6.8 billion by the 2070s.</p><p> Local councils and the state and federal governments have been trying to tackle the problem, by means including support for projects such as SIMPaCT, which has cost almost A$4 million.</p><p> Tokyo's climate planTokyo, Japan's sprawling metropolis with 14.1 million residents, is also taking steps to combat increasingly extreme weather, including heat. The capital sweltered in 2023 with a record 90 days above 30 deg C, including 22 \"extremely hot days\" at above 35 deg C.</p><p> Mr Toshifumi Fukuyasu of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's (TMG) climate change department said the government was subsidising the installation of \"cool spots\" such as water coolers and mist-spraying stations in public spaces, and promoting the increase of greenery, including on rooftops and walls.</p><p> Another measure is to embed heat-blocking innovation in pavements and roads.</p><p> There are two main methods: either by coating them in a special material that can effectively reduce surface temperatures by up to 8 deg C, or by embedding water-retaining material that can reduce temperatures by up to 10 deg C.</p><p> The solar heat-blocking pavement has a coating that can reflect infrared radiation using a mixture of heat-reflecting pigment and hollow ceramic microspheres. The water-retaining pavement uses a porous asphalt mixture with the void filled with a water-retaining material. The evaporation of water curbs the rise of pavement temperatures. </p><p> About 190km of roads under the TMG's purview had the heat-resistant coating as at March 2024, with a total of 245km to be coated by 2030. Another 21km of roads had the water-retention feature as at March 2023.</p><p> The method involving water-retaining material has more drawbacks, however.</p><p> \"The temperature is lowered when water evaporates, but it won't work unless we use sprinklers or if it rains for a while,\" said Mr Shinji Wada of the TMG's Construction Bureau. Such roads also tend to be less effective in mitigating noise.</p><p> The heat-blocking coating requires no maintenance work such as water-spraying and has the added advantage of reducing road wear by traffic, he added.</p><p> Flood preventionFlooding and sea level rise are major threats to cities throughout the Asia-Pacific.</p><p>Singapore has invested heavily in expanding and deepening its drainage network, for instance, by building more flood retention tanks and tunnels. It has also raised the minimum height of reclaimed land.</p><p> It recently mapped out how to protect the East Coast area from sea levels that could increase by a metre by the end of this century -- by reclaiming three tracts of land off East Coast Park in the Long Island project.</p><p> Reclaimed land and tidal gates would protect a large stretch of coastline and, in addition, create a reservoir. Around 20km of new coastal and reservoir parks could be added.</p><p> It is all part of the city's broader strategy to adapt to climate threats, and plans have continually been adjusted as the challenges become better understood.</p><p> Tokyo has also taken steps to reduce flood risks.</p><p> On March 28, TMG revised its climate change adaptation plan, enacted in 2021, as it observed an increase in short-term but intense rainfall and record-breaking heat conditions.</p><p> This complements the Tokyo Resilience Project, which has 17 trillion yen (S$149 billion) worth of infrastructure upgrades planned over the next two decades.</p><p> The amount includes 7.1 trillion yen for measures against flooding caused by stronger typhoons, as well as tsunamis triggered by earthquakes.</p><p> The TMG is raising river and coastal embankments, and expanding its intricate cavern of underground water reservoirs that temporarily store flood waters.</p><p> It is also fortifying its extensive subway network and sewerage system against flooding -- everyday infrastructure that many take for granted.</p><p> \"Underground spaces such as subway stations flood faster than above ground and, once flooding begins, water rushes in all at once. This makes it difficult for passengers to evacuate,\" said a policy paper by the TMG's Bureau of Transportation issued in February 2023. \"This makes it all the more urgent to take measures against flood damage.\"</p><p> The TMG manages the Toei Subway, which consists of 106 stations across four lines and had an average of 2.24 million users per day in 2022, but is also working with other railway operators like the Tokyo Metro on disaster mitigation measures.</p><p> Among the first lines of defence are water-stop plates and/or waterproof doors at station entrances and exits, while remote-controlled flood-prevention devices are installed at ventilation openings to stop water from rushing in.</p><p> Inside the tunnels, watertight gates can be activated to prevent flood waters from spreading.</p><p> The goal is to complete work on the entrances at seven stations and ventilation openings of 20 stations by March 2025 on the Toei Subway. </p><p> By the 2040s, the entrances and ventilation openings of 65 stations will be protected, while watertight gates will be in place at seven locations.</p><p> Elsewhere, the TMG is also building new trunk sewers in the wastewater collection system to increase stormwater drainage capacity, using the revised hazard maps and flooding run-off analyses.</p><p> \"Imagine if your toilet becomes unusable, or if the sewage pumps are damaged by flooding and unprocessed water flows back to the surface,\" said Mr Takashi Abe of the TMG's Sewerage Bureau.</p><p> \"If sewerage facilities are flooded due to flood damage and sewerage functions are lost, it will have a significant impact.\"</p><p> Watertight gates are being installed at sewerage plants across Tokyo that altogether process 5.5 million cubic metres of water per day, to protect their electrical systems, and water pumping and disinfection functions. This includes one at the Nakagawa Sewage Treatment Plant that is deemed high-risk as it is located near four rivers.</p><p> Across the region, much more needs to be done to dial back the risks from increasingly severe climate impacts. While the technology and resolve exist to make cities more resilient, the risks are growing for those who fail to act. </p><p> \"Global temperatures are not going to decrease any time soon, and climate-driven hazards will very likely become more frequent and intense,\" said SMU's Prof Chow.</p><p> \"When these events hit fast-growing but unprepared cities in the region, the impacts to vulnerable populations and key infrastructure in cities will be severe.\"</p><p> He added: \"In an increasingly climate-disrupted world, city leaders who fail to prepare should prepare to fail.\" </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["To survive these threats, cities must adapt. The good news is that despite the gloomy predictions about the future, ordinary people, grassroots groups and governments are starting to act and in so doing, creating a safer future. \"Urban residents are on the front line of climate-driven hazards, and communities also can provide essential local knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of resources deployed to reduce climate risk,\" he told The Straits Times. The ongoing heatwave in South-east Asia and floods in southern China as well as the deadly floods in Dubai are the type of growing risks cities face, said Prof Chow."]}, {"relevance_score": 102, "title": "Singapore: LATEST CLIMATE PROJECTIONS FOR SINGAPORE SHOW INTENSIFYING URBAN HEAT AND MORE WET &amp; DRY EXTREMES", "published": "2024-01-05", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore, Jan. 5 -- Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study (V3) presents the world's highest resolution climate projections for Southeast Asia based on the IPCC 6th Assessment Report</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), under the Meteorological ServiceSingapore, has released the findings of the Third National Climate<br/><br/>Change Study (V3[1]) today. V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6)[2].</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. V3 updates Singapore's national climate change projections from the previous study (V2) released by CCRS in 2015. Based on a carefully selected set of global climate models from IPCC AR6, V3 downscales[3] the projections to higher resolutions of 8km over Southeast Asia and 2km over Singapore using CCRS' customised Regional Climate Model. Compared to V2, the V3 projections incorporate improved representations and a wider range of physical processes in the global climate system, enabling more accurate simulation of our regional climate on a finer scale.</p><p>3. V3 uses three projected global socio-economic pathways affecting greenhouse gasemission levels to explore the possible range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by end century. These correspond to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)[4] used in the IPCC AR6. The low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) reflects a shift to sustainable development pathways with net zero targets achieved after 2050 while the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) is driven by energy intensive, fossil fuel-based development. The medium emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) takes a middle-of-the-road pathway where historical patterns of development continue throughout this century.</p><p>Very Hot Days and Warm Nights the New Normal by End Century</p><p>4. Consistent with earlier projections, Singapore is expected to become warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius by end century. Singapore's annual mean temperatures, which increased at a rate of 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade in the past 40 years, is projected to rise to 0.55 degrees Celsius per decade by end century under the high emissions scenario.</p><p>5. Very hot days will become more frequent. Singapore experienced daily maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius[5] 21.4 days per year on average in the last 40 years. By end century, we will see between 41 and 351 days per year on average of such high daily maximum temperatures. More warm nights where temperatures exceed 26.3 degrees Celsius are also projected. From an average of 76 nights per year in the last 40 years,<br/><br/>Singapore could experience such warm nights most nights in the year by end century. Rainfall Extremes to Intensify, Dry Periods to Get Drier</p><p>6. Singapore's rainfall is highly variable at seasonal time scales. By the end of century, total rainfall during the southwest monsoon dry season of June-through-August could fallsignificantly below the historical low of 314 mm (recorded in 1997) around once every threeyears. For the northeast monsoon wet season of November-through-January, the corresponding seasonal total rainfall is projected to exceed the historical high of 1507 mm (recorded in 2006) occasionally.</p><p>7. Extreme daily rainfall[6] is projected to increase across all seasons, with increases ranging from around 6 to 92 per cent in the inter-monsoon months of April and May. On the other hand, dry spells[7] could be more frequent and last longer, with Singapore experiencing<br/><br/>on average one dry spell every 10 to 60 months by end of century.<br/><br/>Mean Sea Level to Rise</p><p>8. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario. This increase from the previous V2 projections (around 1m by end century) is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels Staying Resilient in The Face of Climate Change</p><p>9. Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. Singapore is doing our part, with the Singapore Green Plan. We are committed to reach net-zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>10. In addition, the Government takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change. The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate resilient.

MSS will also be sharing the V3 data with ASEAN Member States at a later stage. In addition, MSS will be collaborating with international entities and the wider scientific community to undertake joint research using V3 data.</p><p>12. To deepen our understanding of the impacts of climate change, NEA today also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impacts Science Research (CISR)Programme[8] for new research proposals on food security, impacts on human health, water resources, sea level rise and impacts on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector. In December last year, eight projects were awarded under the Programme's first grant call. These projects will make use of V3 results to look into areas like the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore, changes in our tropical forest landscape, among others.</p><p>13.

As a city-state with limited land and natural resources, research and development in Urban Solutions and Sustainability continues to be a key national priority so that we can build a sustainable, resilient, and liveable city. This is especially so as we chart Singapore's long-term development.</p><p>2. At the Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS) R&amp;D Congress today, Guest-of-Honour Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, reaffirmed the importance of strong partnerships between the Government, Institutes of Higher Learning, research institutes and firms, to effectively translate research findings into applicable outcomes.</p><p>3. The USS domain is one of the four verticals under Singapore's Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plan. It aims to challenges in sustainability, liveability, and resilience, through the transformation of our built environment. The USS domain has its roots as early as 2006 when the Science and Technology 2010 plan was developed primarily to address our energy and water constraints. In 2015, the scope of the USS domain was expanded to address other imperatives related to the sustainability and liveability of our future city. These include food, waste, urban design and mobility, as well as climate science.</p><p>4. This year, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has partnered the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) to organise the event. This partnership underscores the growing collaboration across USS agencies and a stronger emphasis on environmental sustainability.</p><p>5. Themed \"Building Sustainable, Resilient and Liveable Cities of Tomorrow\", the Congress features more than 60 eminent speakers from various disciplines, across topics such as leveraging technology for resource circularity, climate adaptation, building cities that nurture citizens' health and well-being, and building resilience in the built environment sector through automation and digitalisation.</p><p>6. At the Congress, Minister Desmond Lee announced several key initiatives to support R&amp;D efforts within the USS domain:</p><p>a) Strategic Collaboration between URA and SUTD on urban planning research</p><p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is working with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) on a five-year strategic collaboration focusing on urban planning research. This partnership aims to enhance urban planners' decision-making processes, support them to better address emerging trends and disruptions in a fast-changing and complex environment, and uplift Singapore's competency in urban planning and design.

Even as we build up scientific knowledge through research, today's competitive landscape with shorter innovation cycles requires us to actively proliferate innovative solutions to the market for wider adoption. To achieve this, the USS domain has provided funding platforms to fast track the innovation process, such as the Built Environment Technology Alliance (BETA), Built Environment Accelerate to Market Programme (BEAMP) and the Living Lab (Water) Funding Initiative. Together with the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), we have also set up the USS Innovation &amp; Enterprise Office (USS IEO), a national platform that aims to bring more impactful technologies from lab to market for the USS domain. The USS IEO does so by facilitating technology translation in partnership with the larger innovation ecosystem, which includes research performers, industry and agencies such as IPI Singapore.</p><p>8 The Government has also cultivated public-private partnerships through initiatives such as NEA's Innovating and Curating Better Automation and Technology for Environmental Services (INCUBATE) partnership programme. The programme offers a platform for the technology providers, service providers, and progressive premises owners to co-create innovative and productive solutions, conduct trials, and scale-up implementation to address market needs.</p><p>9 As the science and technology landscape is constantly evolving, the Government will continue to provide support though various RIE initiatives to strengthen the USS ecosystem, so that we can continue to build a more sustainable, resilient, and liveable home.</p><p>Issued by: Ministry of National Development, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment</p><p>Date: 4 October 2023</p><p>ANNEX A (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow</url>) : URA-SUTD Strategic Collaboration</p><p>1. In October 2021, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) embarked on a strategic research collaboration. The 5-year cross-sector collaboration provides a sustained platform to develop R&amp;D solutions and capabilities through quick experimentation, test-bedding and implementation of joint research projects. Through this partnership, URA aims to enhance urban planners' decision-making processes, enable them to better address emerging trends and disruptions in a fast-changing and complex environment, and advance Singapore's competency in urban planning and design.</p><p>2. This is the first of several strategic research collaborations that URA has been discussing with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) in Singapore.</p><p>3. Under the URA-SUTD collaboration, faculty members including PhD students contribute their expertise and lead research projects co-developed with URA officers. URA will support the funding of these research projects and programmes over the five-year period, which will also include knowledge-exchange and capability-building programmes.</p><p>4. One ongoing research project is titled \"Computational Modelling for Optimisation of Planning and Urban Design Parameters\", led by SUTD's Asst Prof Peter Ortner in collaboration with URA's Design &amp; Planning Lab. Tapping on SUTD's expertise in computational modelling, this project aims to develop a generative design and optimisation workflow for planners to simulate and test planning scenarios within a shorter timeframe, as well as formulate development control and urban design guidelines more efficiently.</p><p>a. Since its commencement in January 2022, the project has demonstrated prototypes that can procedurally generate land parcellation and residential development scenarios as well as optimisation techniques to evaluate and shortlist generated solutions that best fit development constraints.</p><p>b. The SUTD team is also developing a proof-of-concept web application which incorporates generative design and optimisation processes with interfaces tailored to the planning workflow. When implemented, this application has the potential to facilitate more efficient work processes for planners.</p><p>c. This research project is targeted to be completed in 2025. The outcomes will be progressively integrated within URA's ePlanner, an in-house geospatial web application that currently serves over 1,000 planners across 40 public agencies.</p><p>5. The URA-SUTD collaboration has demonstrated the benefits of adopting an inter-disciplinary approach to tackle challenges in urban planning. For instance, the use of mathematical algorithms for land parcel generation and optimising urban forms has introduced opportunities for productivity gains as well as new planning insights. As the Whole-of-Government Urban Planning &amp; Design Technology Centre of Excellence (URBEX), URA will continue to partner IHLs and research institutes to translate research outcomes into user-friendly tools that can improve the work of planning agencies across the government.</p><p>ANNEX B (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):</url> Media Factsheet</p><p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE CENTRE FOR LIVEABLE CITIES AND SINGAPORE-ETH CENTRE IN KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND CAPABILITY BUILDING</p><p>1.

The proper management of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) is aligned to the global drive towards circular economy, which contributes to the fight against climate change. E-waste recycling creates \"urban mining\" opportunities to recapture precious and critical metals that could replace primary raw materials such as gold, platinum, lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel. Singapore can play our part in the green economy in recovering critical, precious, and rare earth metals from e-waste to generate economic returns while enhancing the resilience of critical resources.</p><p>2. Through the Closing the Resource Loop (CTRL) Funding Initiative in RIE2025, NEA has pledged $17 million to support the NTU Singapore-CEA Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE) to research on developing cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions for recycling e-waste.</p><p>3. This fund enables SCARCE to build on the promising findings of their Phase 1 research (conducted from 2018-2023). The focus of Phase 2 is to integrate the developed processes into closed loop resource recovery solutions for test bedding, leading to their adoption at an industrial scale. SCARCE will also embark on new and innovative research areas, such as recycling of lithium-ion batteries, smart sorting and mechanochemical methods into achieving better material recovery yield.</p><p>4.

Under the first RIE2025 Grant Call of Cities of Tomorrow's City in Nature research pillar, the National Parks Board (NParks) is awarding its first project to the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The project would kickstart the long-term monitoring of key ecosystem processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling within our forests and urban green spaces. This $1.82m project will be led by researchers from the Asian School of the Environment (NTU), over a 3-year period.</p><p>2. Plants take in and release nutrients throughout their growth and decomposition, and nutrient flows can serve as indicators of ecosystem health. This project aims to establish baseline rates of nutrient release from leaf litter and soil in Singapore's forests and urban green spaces, and to develop a protocol for continued long-term monitoring. This is key for understanding patterns of nutrient flows across different natural and urban landscapes, and detecting fluctuations due to weather, climate, and urbanisation.</p><p>3. Data from this project will enable predictive modelling of nutrient cycling rates under different environmental conditions and landscape management practices. These insights can then inform the enhancement of existing urban greenery management strategies to optimise urban nutrient cycles for improved climate resilience and ecosystem health. By contributing towards the long-term monitoring of ecosystem health, the project will guide our overall City in Nature efforts to conserve and extend our natural capital, and further integrate nature into the urban environment.</p><p>About Cities of Tomorrow's City in Nature research pillar</p><p>As one of the five key pillars under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the City in Nature vision aims to further restore and integrate nature into Singapore's urban fabric, so as to strengthen our distinctiveness as a highly liveable city, while mitigating the impacts of urbanisation and adapting to climate change. To provide a scientific foundation to support these transformative efforts, the Cities of Tomorrow Research &amp; Development Programme set up a new City in Nature research pillar under RIE 2025, led by NParks. This new research vertical will build upon existing R&amp;D efforts in greenery and biodiversity, to strengthen our ecological and climate resilience, and will also seek to inform nature-based solutions for social resilience. The vertical has been allocated $17.9m in research funding from NRF's Urban Solutions and Sustainability domain, from FY21 to FY25.</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: ESG]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["The Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS) domain, part of Singapore's Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plan, focuses on addressing challenges in sustainability, liveability, and resilience in the built environment.

The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events today - from droughts in Africa and the USA, to heat waves in Asia and Europe - are clear warning signs for us to take decisive action and secure our collective future.</p><p>The first Global Stocktake presents a timely opportunity for the world to course-correct to keep the target of 1.5C within reach. This can only be achieved if we deliver substantive, inclusive, and balanced outcomes at COP28 across mitigation, adaptation as well as means of implementation. At this critical juncture, we need to foster even stronger multilateral cooperation than before. Today, Singapore reaffirms its commitment to domestic climate action, regional partnerships and global collaboration.</p><p>Domestic climate action</p><p>First, Singapore is committed to doing its part by delivering progress on domestic climate action.</p><p>Last year, Singapore raised our climate ambition. We submitted our enhanced Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) with a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and our updated 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce our emissions to 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, after peaking our emissions earlier.</p><p>Since then, Singapore has been focusing our efforts on implementation and delivering progress. Our climate targets are backed by concrete policies and plans.</p><p>Singapore's carbon tax covers around 80% of our national greenhouse gas emissions and has one of the highest coverages in the world. We will raise our carbon tax level five-fold to 25 Singapore dollars, or around 19 US dollars, per tonne of emissions in 2024 and progressively to 50-80 Singapore dollars, or 37-60 US dollars, by 2030, making it one of the highest in Asia. This will send a strong price signal and drive emitters to decarbonise, while giving companies greater price certainty for forward planning.</p><p>We have mandated zero vehicle population growth since 2018 and have put in place policy levers to support our vision for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. Our 2040 target is for public, active and shared transport modes to account for 9 in 10 of all peak-period journeys.</p><p>We are developing a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply ecosystem for Singapore. Neste, a Finnish energy company, recently completed its US$1.76 billion expansion to increase SAF production capacity to up to 1 million tonnes per annum, making Singapore home to the largest SAF production site in the world. Following a 20-month pilot completed in November 2023 which found Singapore to be operationally ready to supply SAF, we are developing a structural offtake mechanism to support SAF adoption in Singapore.</p><p>We have put in place stronger emission standards for the power sector. From 2024, we will require all new and repowered natural gas power plants to be 10% more efficient and at least 30% hydrogen-compatible by volume.</p><p>Singapore is alternative energy disadvantaged and faces an uphill challenge given the lack of domestic mitigation options. Nevertheless, we have invested in holistic and innovative solutions to overcome our constraints.</p><p>Although we have limited to no potential for hydroelectric, tidal, wind and geothermal power, we have spared no effort in harnessing solar power. We are already halfway towards achieving our target of 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.</p><p>Given our small physical size and high population density, we have made innovative use of our limited land. We have deployed large-scale floating solar farms, which leverage the surface area of our reservoirs to scale up solar deployment. In 2024, Southeast Asia (SEA)'s first floating and stacked Energy Storage System, Seatrium's Floating Living Lab, will also start operations in Singapore.</p><p>Regional partnerships</p><p>Second, Singapore is committed to working with other Parties to deliver on our pledges through regional partnerships. Through such collaboration, we aim to unlock decarbonisation potential across national boundaries more quickly and effectively for all Parties, to accelerate Asia's low-carbon transition.</p><p>One key enabler is the channelling of finance to catalyse our region's transition. It is estimated that Asia will need US$1.7 trillion in climate and infrastructure investments per annum through 2030. This is a substantial amount - it will be necessary to crowd in both concessional and commercial capital. At COP28, Singapore will announce Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships (FAST-P), a new blended finance initiative that aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion in finance. FAST-P will bring together public and private sector partners to de-risk and finance transition and marginally-bankable green projects in Asia. Through FAST-P, we hope that climate action will be realised as an opportunity for collective regional growth.</p><p>Another key enabler is the promotion of win-win partnerships to fast track our region's energy transition. As cross-border clean energy trade develops, Singapore has announced plans to import around 4GW of low-carbon electricity from Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam by 2035. This lead demand forms the buildings blocks of our joint vision of an ASEAN Power Grid, which will strengthen energy resilience and decarbonise power generation across Southeast Asia.</p><p>Beyond mitigation, regional partnerships are essential to strengthening our collective climate resilience. An important first step is to advance our common understanding of climate science and the regional impacts of climate change.</p><p>To support mutual learning, Singapore will share the findings from our Third National Climate Change Study (V3), the world's first high-resolution regional climate projections based on the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), with regional partners through the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) and the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment for the Southeast Asia Region. We will also work with partners to conduct more robust assessments of climate impacts in specific areas such as food, water and livability.</p><p>Singapore also actively participates in partnerships to advance adaptation priority areas such as food, water, and heat resilience, as well as coastal and flood protection.</p><p>By incorporating V3's regional climate projections into the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's climate risk assessment tools, regional partners can conduct climate change impact assessments on their agrifood systems.</p><p>These efforts complement our other capacity building programmes for water management and governance, such as the Temasek Foundation Water Leadership Programme. Similarly, for heat resilience, the National University of Singapore will host the Global Heat Health Information Network's Southeast Asia Regional Heat Health Node, to build regional capabilities in addressing extreme heat risks.</p><p>For coastal protection and flood management, Singapore has launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI). CFI Singapore forges strong connections with industry partners and international experts, to enhance capabilities and expertise in coastal and flood protection. Singapore will also continue to share our perspectives and knowledge through platforms such as the Singapore International Water Week and the International Panel on Deltas and Coastal Areas.</p><p>In line with the UN Early Warnings for All Initiative, which Singapore supported at COP27, we conduct regional capability building activities to strengthen our collective climate resilience. This includes training workshops under the ASMC Capability Building Programme in areas such as regional climate projections, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, as well as fire hotspot and haze assessments.</p><p>Global collaboration</p><p>Third, global collaboration is essential to ensure a just and inclusive transition. To accelerate implementation without leaving anyone behind, we must promote knowledge sharing and mutual learning among countries.</p><p>Singapore has been providing capacity building through our Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) and its Sustainability Action Package (SAP). Close to 150,000 officials from over 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations have participated in programmes covering topics such as climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, and green finance.</p><p>Multilateralism at platforms such as the UNFCCC continues to be key to ensuring a just and inclusive transition. Singapore is committed to helping forge global consensus, to achieve substantive, balanced and inclusive outcomes.</p><p>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu will co-facilitate the Ministerial consultations on Mitigation with Norway.</p><p>Chief Negotiator Joseph Teo will lead the Joint Contact Group for the Global Stocktake discussions as co-chairman with the UK.</p><p>As IPCC WGII's Co-Chair for the 7th Assessment Report (AR7) cycle, Associate Professor Winston Chow will help advance global assessments of climate change vulnerability and adaptation options, which will inform the second Global Stocktake in 2028. These findings will be especially valuable for fellow developing countries.</p><p>At COP28, Singapore is pleased to support the following initiatives which call for collective and inclusive climate action:</p><p>We have co-sponsored the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge. Singapore's energy intensity is ranked 11th lowest, when compared to 38 OECD countries.</p><p>To demonstrate support for the COP28 Presidency's Early Coal Retirement Initiative to reduce global dependence on coal, the Singapore government is prepared to offtake transition credits if it meets our standards for high environmental integrity. This is aligned with COP28's focus on accelerating the energy transition, while ensuring sustainable socio-economic development.</p><p>As the country lead for package development under the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership, we will announce Ghana's Country Package for Forest, Nature and Climate.</p><p>To support the development of emerging technological and market solutions, we will also be signing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and Implementation Agreements (IAs) on carbon credits and low-carbon solutions cooperation with countries such as Papua New Guinea.</p><p>We stand at a critical crossroads. The decisions we make, the actions we take at COP28 will shape the future of our planet and generations to come. The window of opportunity to tackle climate change, the existential crisis of this generation, is small and closing quickly. We must urgently grasp this chance to course-correct and take decisive action to keep the target of 1.5C in sight.</p><p>Let us face climate change not as individual nations, but instead seize this opportunity to Unite, Act and Deliver.</p><p>Source: National Climate Change Secretariat, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Regulatory and Legal]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["To accelerate implementation without leaving anyone behind, we must promote knowledge sharing and mutual learning among countries.

The NGFS Annual Plenary Meeting on 25 April 2023 brought together in person and virtually its 144 member institutions and observers to discuss the progress of its workplan in the past year as well as upcoming deliverables. Members discussed climate scenarios and vulnerability assessments of the financial sector, the implications of climate change for monetary policy, the role of supervisors with respect to transition planning by financial institutions, central banks' net zero strategies, and training and capacity building.</p><p>3. The NGFS also conducted its Plenary Outreach with Asia-Pacific members, which discussed identifying and managing climate-related financial risks in the region and facilitating financing flows to support Asia's transition. The group recognized the critical role of Asia in the global transition toward net zero, underscored the importance of climate scenario analysis and the stewardship role of financial institutions in their clients' transition plans.</p><p>4. On 26 April 2023, the NGFS held a full-day Workshop for more than 160 participants, including NGFS members, and bringing together speakers from across the Network, the financial sector and academia. Participants discussed how central banks and supervisors could further support the following areas:</p><p>* Blended Finance: Participants discussed the role of public-private partnerships through blended finance in supporting the transition to net zero and climate adaptation. They also discussed the need to broaden the investor base, grow local financing capacity, scale up cross border private capital flows into blended finance projects, and the importance of credible data and disclosures to measure impact.</p><p>* Macroeconomics of Climate Change: Participants discussed the implications of climate change on financial market pricing, macroeconomic modelling, and monetary policy. This included the challenges in estimating the impact of climate change on macroeconomic variables such as inflation, and the limits of economic models in capturing the significant uncertainties in future climate events.</p><p>* Nature-related Risks: Participants discussed the early findings by the NGFS Taskforce on Biodiversity Loss and Nature-Related Risks, including progress in assessing such risks, the interconnectedness of climate and nature-related risks, as well as challenges faced by financial institutions in measuring and managing these risks. There were also discussions on potential future work, including bridging data gaps and scenario analysis of biodiversity loss.</p><p>* Transition Planning: Participants discussed the importance of transition planning by financial institutions to manage risks from both micro- and macroprudential perspectives. They emphasised the role of financial institutions in stewarding the real economy to transition towards net zero, as opposed to simply divesting and de-risking. Discussion on future work touched on the need to build capacity among central banks and supervisors to effectively engage financial institutions on their transition planning processes and to better understand the regional and domestic contexts of transition pathways and adaptation efforts.</p><p>5. Mr Menon said \"The rich discussions at the NGFS over the past two days is testimony to the progress made by the global community of central banks and supervisors in working with the financial industry to manage climate-related financial risks and supporting an effective transition to a net zero economy.

Good morning. I wish to thank Commissioner Mais for the gracious invitation to speak at this year's Connecticut Conference on Climate Change and Insurance (C4I).</p><p>2. I am glad to be joined this morning, in person and virtually, by fellow insurance supervisors, academics and members of the financial services industry. We are here today with a common purpose: to learn, engage in discussions, challenge existing paradigms, and most importantly, to listen. C4I's agenda this year encompasses a comprehensive range of topics where insurance supervisors, public sector leaders and legislators have vital roles to play, be it \"Bridging Data Gaps\", \"Cultivating Resilient and Sustainable Practices\" among insurers or \"Fortifying Resilience\" through legislative initiatives.</p><p>3. These topics are at the core of how the climate crisis is impacting the insurance industry, its customers and our communities, and where thoughtful, bold and collective actions are needed.</p><p>Role of insurance amidst climate change</p><p>4. It is important to remind ourselves that the insurance industry has been managing natural catastrophe and weather-related risks for decades, making it a crucial player in addressing climate change Insurers manage significant investment portfolios and are increasingly investing in renewables and low-carbon assets, supporting the transition to a greener economy. Insurance also acts as a financial safety net, shifting a portion of the financial burden from individuals and businesses to insurers in the event of climate-related disasters.</p><p>5. Insurers offer specialized policies such as flood or wildfire insurance for climate-related risks, of which some of the most sophisticated are here in the United States, aiding the recovery from climate-induced losses.</p><p>6. Insurers also invest in research to evaluate climate-related risks, to better understand the impacts of events like natural disasters and extreme weather on policyholders. In addition, insurers advocate for climate-friendly policies and are progressively implementing eco-conscious practices within their operations.</p><p>7. It is very encouraging to see how the insurance industry is contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This is good news for our societies and communities. Three important questions remain - what more needs to be done, where can private-sector initiatives be complemented by public sector intervention and assistance, and what must change to bring about public-private synergy and multiply our combined efforts. I am hopeful that today's C4I discussions will provide some answers to these questions.</p><p>International Climate Risk Work at the IAIS and SIF</p><p>8. Insurance supervisors can likewise contribute to robust climate risk management and ongoing public-private partnerships that facilitate national and global decarbonisation efforts. Supervisors at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF) are collaborating and working collectively towards this end.</p><p>9. First, to strengthen supervisory expectations, the IAIS is reinforcing the importance of incorporating climate-related risks into insurers' business operations and risk management practices by providing additional guidance on supervisory expectations, including through an ongoing review of applicable Insurance Core Principles (ICP).</p><p>10. The first of three consultation papers relating to climate risk supervisory guidance was published in March. This outlined proposed changes to the ICP Introduction to position climate risk within the global framework for insurance supervision, and further proposed changes to the existing supporting material related to governance, risk management and internal controls. The second consultation paper will be published next month, and will cover supervisory guidance related to market conduct, including greenwashing, together with an Application Paper on Climate Risk Scenario Analysis.</p><p>11. Second, the IAIS has undertaken work to improve the availability and transparency of climate risk related data. Climate data elements have been incorporated and analysed in the IAIS' Global Monitoring Exercise for the last three years, and this will continue. Each year's data collection and resulting report contribute to a global baseline of climate risk data, and helps enhance the supervisory community's assessment of the impact of climate change on the global insurance sector.</p><p>12. Third, with the finalisation of the ISSB's sustainability disclosure standards, the IAIS has embarked on new work relating to climate risk disclosures and regulatory reporting for the insurance sector. It will study the type and nature of climate risk disclosures that can provide supervisors, investors, policyholders and other stakeholders with the information they need to assess the risks to an insurer.</p><p>13. The aforementioned priorities of the IAIS are meant to be iterative and mutually reinforcing - climate change awareness reinforced by standards, implemented through scenario analysis and effective risk management, supported by quality and available data. It is also a necessary cycle - one that encourages insurers to invest in modelling longer-term risks and understanding the potential implications; and to appreciate the actions that are required now even as different parts of the financial sector contribute to an orderly transition towards net zero.</p><p>14. While the IAIS has a more extensive membership, the Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF) is a UNDP-supported grouping of about 40 like-minded insurance supervisors looking specifically into sustainability issues. Through its research and exchange of best practices on climate and biodiversity risks, the SIF is adopting a pathfinder role for the insurance sector by probing further and invoking deeper supervisory discussions, including on less explored areas in the sustainability space.</p><p>15. A 2022 high level stock-take among SIF members found that a number of supervisors had begun to include climate-related risks in their capital frameworks, mostly in Own Risk and Solvency Assessments (\"ORSAs\"), and more were planning to do so. SIF is conducting a deeper dive into the exact approaches taken, particularly among leading insurance supervisors.</p><p>16. Another area of SIF's focus is net zero transition plans. SIF is gathering views from insurance supervisors on national and supervisory thinking on transition plans and aims to enhance understanding among its membership on the progress of transition planning and development of transition plans by licensed insurers.</p><p>Singapore Developments</p><p>17. Let me take the opportunity to share some updates on the work we are doing in Singapore to further origination and access of ESG data, climate-related disclosures and transition planning.</p><p>18. MAS launched Project Greenprint to partner the industry in co-developing digital utilities to facilitate the efficient flow of trusted ESG data. This data would support financial institutions and businesses in mobilising capital toward sustainable projects, monitoring their climate and sustainability-related commitments, and measuring the impact associated with their investments.</p><p>19. Under Project Greenprint, MAS and the Singapore Exchange piloted a digital ESG disclosure portal last year. Titled ESGenome, this portal allows SGX-listed companies to report baseline ESG metrics in a structured and efficient manner, and for investors to access the data in a comparable and consistent format.</p><p>20. Over the past year, more than 180 listed companies have been onboarded onto ESGenome, with over 40% of them starting to populate their data. On average, these listed companies have filled in 60 ESG metrics, with some populating up to 300 metrics. Moving forward, MAS will be scaling Project Greenprint to support national-level reporting needs, including reporting by SMEs and private companies, as well as defining baseline metrics to streamline SME reporting across multiple sustainability reporting frameworks and methodologies.</p><p>Climate-related disclosures</p><p>21. On sustainability-related disclosures, MAS welcomes the publication of the International Sustainability Standards Board's (\"ISSB\") disclosure standards, which will serve as a comprehensive global disclosure standard for corporate sustainability reporting. In Singapore, listed companies in five prioritised industries are already required to provide full TCFD-aligned disclosures this year, and all other listed companies will also have to do so on a 'comply-or-explain' basis.</p><p>22. MAS is working with other government agencies to chart a coordinated Whole of Government approach on strengthening and phasing in sustainability disclosure requirements. Through Singapore's Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee (SRAC), government agencies will work closely with the private sector to develop a sustainability reporting roadmap for Singapore-incorporated companies, including financial institutions and other non-listed companies.</p><p>23. In a recently concluded public consultation, the SRAC has recommended, among others, to align climate-related disclosures to the ISSB Sustainability Disclosure Standards and to mandate climate related disclosures for non-listed companies of annual revenue more than $1bn from FY2027. These are significant steps towards promoting sustainability and mitigating climate-related risks across the whole economy.</p><p>Transition planning</p><p>24. On Transition Planning, the process of transition planning is a crucial means for insurers to aid their own transition efforts, and those of their customers and investee companies, towards a low carbon future.</p><p>25. In this regard, MAS issued a consultation paper on our Transition Planning Guidelines (\"TPG\") last month. The TPG builds on MAS' existing environment risk supervisory guidance and focus on insurers' internal strategic planning and risk management processes, so they can better prepare for the risks and potential changes in business models associated with the transition towards net zero.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding and managing climate-related risks, there is still much work to be done. The urgency of the issue requires the insurance sector, including supervisors, to continue studying climate risks, improving our capabilities in identifying, assessing, and measuring these risks, and exploring new and innovative ways to mitigate them. The industry also continues to have a role to play in climate adaptation, working with the public sector to find solutions to serve our communities in the face of climate change.</p><p>27. Conferences like C4I help draw out the key questions and issues, while providing a safe space for the insurance industry, supervisors, public sector leaders and academics to debate and find collective solutions.</p><p>28.

For the engineering innovations behind the Tuas Port Phase 1 (TPP1) Reclamation, Wharf Construction &amp; Dredging Project, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and project partners were awarded the 2022 World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO) H.J. Sabbagh Prize for Excellence in Engineering Construction. The ceremony for the WFEO award will be held later this year.</p><p>2. Key design innovations included large-scale reuse of recyclable materials such as dredged seabed material and land-excavated materials, which accounted for more than half of the reclamation fill for TPP1. The reclamation filling, which included clay, was treated to ensure stability of the reclaimed land is within the stringent limits for operating the driverless automated guided vehicles.</p><p>3. The stability of the reclamation fill is maintained using 10 storey-high caissons as earth-retaining walls. These caissons also form the foundations of Tuas port and wharf structures for vessels to berth alongside. The caissons were fabricated at a nearby casting yard, towed out to sea, and submerged on the prepared foundation in the seabed.</p><p>4. 221 caissons were used for the reclamation of TPP1 and the deep-water berths will be capable of accommodating future container ships with a draught of up to 21 metres.

According to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 43% in the next 7 years to reach net zero by 2050. We are now one third of the way through this \"critical decade\" and nowhere near this target. Emissions are still rising, not falling.</p><p>We need to convert commitments to plans and plans to outcomes. More countries and corporations are committing to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 so as to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But few have drawn up concrete plans to do so. Without credible transition plans and financing strategies to support them, climate action will be sporadic and ineffective.</p><p>Green and transition financing is nowhere near what is required to get to net-zero by 2050. The financial sector can play a key role in catalysing transition towards a low carbon, climate-resilient economy. But we are more than 35% short of the annual investment of US$9.2 trillion that would be required to get to net-zero by 2050.</p><p>The NGFS aims to promote the financial sector as a catalyst for the transition to a net-zero world. Through our diverse membership of 125 central banks and financial regulators from more than 90 advanced, emerging, and developing economies, we are well-positioned to do this. Our work programme is multi-faceted. We are:</p><p>* enhancing supervisory practices on managing climate risks;</p><p>* designing actionable climate scenarios;</p><p>* assessing the implications of climate change for monetary policy;</p><p>* providing guidance for central banks' own net-zero transition;</p><p>* analysing nature-related financial risks; and</p><p>* building skills and capabilities among the NGFS membership</p><p>Today, I want to talk about two relatively new areas where the NGFS is making a determined push:</p><p>* transition planning</p><p>* blended finance</p><p>SUPPORTING TRANSITION PLANNING</p><p>To achieve net zero, every economic sector will need to decarbonise. Different sectors will have different transition pathways. In hard-to-abate sectors, the transition could be quite disorderly. Those firms or industries that fail to adequately decarbonise may risk being left with non-viable businesses or stranded assets.</p><p>To support every sector to decarbonise, financial institutions need to fund activities supporting transition and not just green projects. This means channelling funds to:</p><p>* pivot business models for firms in economic sectors that are not so green to become greener; and</p><p>* invest in technologies with a lower carbon footprint or higher energy efficiency.</p><p>Transition finance in turn needs credible transition plans - by both financial institutions and their customers - as well as good transition planning.</p><p>* Many financial institutions have made net-zero commitments and set decarbonisation targets.</p><p>* However, when they finance their customers' own transition to net zero through loans or investments in cleaner technologies, they may see a short-term increase in their financed emissions.This would particularly be the case in hard-to-abate sectors like steel, cement and chemical production.</p><p>* The increase in financed emissions will likely draw pressure and criticism from investors and stakeholders.</p><p>* Only with credible transition plans will financial institutions be able to explain how their transition financing is consistent with their net-zero commitments and decarbonisation targets.</p><p>Financial regulators can set supervisory expectations for financial institutions on their transition plans in several ways.</p><p>* They can provide guidance to financial institutions on having a sound transition planning process that supports the credible transition efforts of their clients rather than divestment as the first choice.</p><p>* They can set expectations that financial institutions should engage their clients on climate risks and nudge them to draw up their own transition plans to mitigate these risks.</p><p>* They can signal to financial institutions the importance of referencing appropriate science-based sectoral pathways with meaningful intermediate targets for decarbonisation.</p><p>* They can adopt a multi-year approach when engaging financial institutions on their transition efforts. This includes acknowledging that there may be short-term increases in their financed emissions from supporting the transition of higher emissions clients towards climate positive outcomes.</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore intends to do all of the above.</p><p>The NGFS is providing thought leadership on the role of financial regulators with respect to financial institutions' transition plans and transition planning process.</p><p>* We are exploring the extent to which financial institutions' transition plans should be considered within the supervisory toolkit and overall prudential framework.</p><p>* While most financial institutions' transition plans have a climate focus, they have different nuances in objectives, ranging from climate risk mitigation to reducing financed emissions to supporting the real economy's transition to net-zero.</p><p>* But there are some common elements to all transition plans which are relevant to supervisors for assessing safety and soundness.</p><p>The NGFS has completed a stock-take of supervisory frameworks with respect to financial institutions' transition plans.</p><p>* We are sharing the results of the stock-take with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board, to facilitate greater coordination in the development of transition planning standards.</p><p>* We will publish a report on key findings and next steps that will provide a basis for further work on the role of transition plans in greening the financial system.</p><p>The next phase of the NGFS' work will develop guidance on transition planning to cater to different supervisors' mandates, toolkits, and prudential frameworks. Recognising that there is a spectrum of supervisory mandates, such guidance will be based on a building block approach to aid financial regulators with varying approaches in their review of financial institutions' transition plans or planning process.</p><p>SCALING BLENDED FINANCE</p><p>To move the needle on global emissions, we need to facilitate the decarbonisation of emerging markets and developing economies.</p><p>* Emerging markets and developing economies account for more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>* They are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their economic development and energy needs.</p><p>* Their energy needs are expected to grow significantly in the coming years alongside economic growth and development.</p><p>* It is not right to hold back their economic growth. Rather, we need transition finance to help decouple growth from emissions - through cleaner energy, greater energy efficiency, more electrification, and production processes with a lower carbon footprint.</p><p>But emerging economies and developing countries face several challenges in mobilising the transition financing necessary for decarbonisation.</p><p>* First, they have fiscal constraints . Public debt remains the main source of funding for transition in these economies. But there are tight limits to how much debt these governments can sustainably raise, especially in foreign currencies.</p><p>* Second, they have limited access to private capital . They lack depth in their domestic capital markets; they lack large corporations, and a broad investor base.</p><p>* Third, many of their transition projects are only marginally bankable. Regulatory and political risks heighten the likelihood of default, transaction lead times are long, projects require prohibitively large amounts of start-up capital, and there is limited access to expertise in project development and financing.</p><p>The current model of multilateral bank lending is inadequate to mobilise the capital that countries need for their transition. A good part of multilateral bank lending goes to bankable projects that could well have been financed by private capital. Multilateral banks tend to prioritise projects with lower risks to support their mandates of macroeconomic stability and growth. But in truth, their capital is most needed for riskier projects that are only marginally bankable but can support the transition.</p><p>What we need is public-private partnership in financing that is synergistic not duplicative. We need to make every dollar of public capital count. We need blended finance. Catalytic and concessional funding from the public sector, multilateral development banks, and philanthropic sources can potentially enhance project bankability and help to crowd in private capital. They can:</p><p>* mitigate a portion of project risks to improve the risk-return profile and attract a broader set of private investors;</p><p>* provide technical assistance at the project design stage to increase the pipeline of investable projects; and</p><p>* facilitate the development of a mature climate blended finance ecosystem in emerging markets and developing economies.</p><p>Blended finance is not new but we need to scale it up and this requires a collective effort. Central banks and financial supervisors can support this effort to varying degrees, depending on their mandates.</p><p>The NGFS has launched a Blended Finance Initiative to contribute to this collective effort in two ways.</p><p>* We will use our convening power to raise awareness of blended finance for climate action and help to bring the relevant parties into the room.</p><p>* We will identify any potential market, policy or regulatory barriers that hamper the scaling up of blended finance.</p><p>The NGFS aims to launch at COP28 a Handbook on Blended Finance. We will release next month a conceptual note on the Handbook which will serve as a preamble. The Handbook will be organised around three key themes.</p><p>First, identify key elements needed to build a climate blended finance ecosystem.</p><p>* To scale up blended finance for climate adaptation and mitigation, we need financial instruments and vehicles that can align incentives in both the public and private sector and entice private capital with varying appetite for risk.</p><p> For example, green bond funds or outcome-based debt instruments such as sustainability-linked bonds can attract various types of private sector actors if key contractual terms are appropriately set.</p><p>* To attract investors with different expected returns, risk profiles, investment horizons and objectives, the investor base should be expanded.</p><p> For example, we can aim for a higher level of participation by institutional and private equity investors as well as philanthropic capital.</p><p>Second, highlight best practices and principles to scale up blended finance for climate adaptation and mitigation. These include factors like:</p><p>* an appropriate institutional, legal and policy framework, and regulatory clarity;</p><p>* a robust climate information architecture for investment and performance risk assessment, comprising reliable and comparable climate data, internationally interoperable taxonomies, and climate disclosures; and</p><p>* some form of common finance reporting standards that can be used to measure, monitor, verify, and assess impact.</p><p>Third, identify demonstrative projects that showcase good mechanisms available to scale blended finance. Our scan of such projects has surfaced some preliminary observations on the key mechanisms to scale blended finance;</p><p>* standardised documentation to streamline due diligence and project preparation processes and to lower origination costs;</p><p>* effective currency hedging solutions to address local currency risks;</p><p>* effective currency hedging solutions to address local currency risks; pooling of investors at the fund or facility level and taking a portfolio rather than individual project approach; and</p><p>* leveraging on the significant catalytic effect of grants in the upstream project preparation phase.</p><p>We will study these observations further and present them in detail in the Handbook.</p><p>We must take an ecosystem approach to resolve the climate crisis. Getting to net-zero requires the real economy and the financial sector to move in lockstep. This requires applying the collective knowledge and resources of governments, central banks, and financial regulators and financial institutions, corporates and individuals. In a small way, this third edition of the Green Swan Conference contributes to this collective effort. Let us harness our strengths and coordinate our action across the ecosystem.

The research project will also look at developing a digital urban climate twin to assess urban cooling scenarios for Singapore.</p><p> The initiative also has synergies with the IPCC's upcoming Special Report on Cities and Climate Change -- a key priority of governments around the world, said Prof Chow. </p><p> The report is extremely timely as cities are consistently becoming larger, and about 70 per cent of the world's population will be living in cities by the middle of the century, he noted.</p><p> About 65 per cent to 70 per cent of current global greenhouse gas emissions come from these urban areas, and coastal cities in particular are incredibly vulnerable to a wide range of climate impacts, such as rising sea levels. </p><p> As those in densely built-up areas generally experience higher air temperatures, a larger segment of the population could experience heat stress during a heatwave, for instance.</p><p> While cities generally have the infrastructure to cope with this, they would need to invest in more expertise as heat stress could become more complicated with an ageing population, he added.</p><p> Likewise, with their immense knowledge base, and financial and social capital, cities are also well equipped to effectively mitigate climate change, said Prof Chow.</p><p> The special report hopes to bring together all these different aspects of climate change and its links to urban cities, which would help governments take the necessary action, he added. </p><p> \"Then, half my battle would already be won,\" said Prof Chow.</p><p>Singapore's Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment said in April that it had nominated Prof Chow as he is well-qualified to contribute to advancing the science of climate change, particularly in relation to cities. </p><p> Supporting Prof Chow in Nairobi, Mr Hazri Hassan, divisional director of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's International Policy Division, recalled that the atmosphere was \"tense with anticipation\" during the series of elections from July 25 to July 28 for numerous positions in the IPCC Bureau. </p><p> \"Despite the tension, I was quietly confident that Winston stood a good chance of being elected, given his credentials and the extensive preparatory work done ahead of the elections. However, we knew we could never take anything for granted.</p><p> \"That was why we continued to campaign for him right up to the elections for the Working Group II co-chair position.

The IPCC is the United Nations' body for assessing the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for mitigation and adaptation. IPCC assessments provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies and contribute to global climate action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p><p>3.

Winston Chow is Associate Professor of Urban Climate at the Singapore Management University's College of Integrative Studies, as well as a Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow. His main research interests and publications focus on urban climate change risk and vulnerability, and on urban climatology with a focus on heat island adaptation and mitigation. Since 2017, he has been a Principal Investigator for the multi-institute Cooling Singapore Initiative, which develops climate-resilient solutions to address the urban heat challenge in Singapore.</p><p>5. Associate Professor Chow has been actively involved in the IPCC. Under the Sixth Assessment Report Cycle (AR6), he served as the IPCC Lead Author for the chapters on \"Cities, Settlements and Key Infrastructure,\" and \"Cities and Settlements by the Sea\" in WG II, and contributed significantly on the urban aspects of climate change in the other WGs. He is also a member of the Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data), which provides guidance to ensure that the climate change data and scenarios used in the IPCC's work are available, transparent, consistent and of high quality. Given his extensive experience in this field, Associate Professor Chow is well-qualified to contribute to advancing the science of climate change, and shape practical recommendations on how governments and societies can effectively adapt to climate risks and enhance climate resilience. This is particularly given that the IPCC has decided to include a Special Report on Cities and Climate Change in the AR7 cycle, which is an area in which he has done much research and field work.</p><p>6. Associate Professor Chow said: \"I am honoured to be nominated by the Singapore Government for the important role of Co-Chair of IPCC's WG II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

Having Associate Professor Chow play a leadership role in the IPCC Bureau is part of Singapore's efforts to contribute to global cooperation to advance international climate science. Singapore has been contributing actively to the work of the IPCC. In addition to participating at the IPCC plenary sessions, Singapore hosted the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report Scoping Meeting and the 57th Session of the IPCC Bureau Meeting in October 2019. Singapore also hosted senior IPCC officials and authors in 2014 to present and discuss key findings and implications for Southeast Asia.</p><p>8.

At the current pace, the world is on track for a global temperature rise of at least 2.7 degrees in this century.</p><p>To spur the net-zero transition, it has become urgent that countries address the issue of carbon pricing. Setting a price on carbon quantifies the costs of emissions to economies and societies. It enables governments to penalise emitters and the tax collected may be used to fund climate adaptation needs.

A revised carbon tax for 2024 is expected to be announced in the next Budget. The International Monetary Fund has recommended a global average carbon price of US$75 per tonne, but a recent poll of climate economists by Reuters puts an even higher price of at least US$100 per tonne.</p><p>Carbon pricing mechanisms mainly take one of two forms: a direct carbon tax or an emissions trading system (ETS), also called cap-and-trade, which establishes a market price for emissions. To date, the World Bank estimates that 21.5 per cent of global GHG emissions are covered by carbon pricing instruments, compared to 15 per cent in 2020. Carbon prices set by the various jurisdictions vary widely from less than US$1 to as high as US$137 in Sweden. China, the world's largest emitter, launched its carbon market in July and prices have held steady at between US$7 and over US$8. But critics believe the system does not go far enough. Benchmark carbon prices in Europe breached 60 euros (S$94) in September and October.</p><p>To be sure, there are challenges in carbon pricing and taxation.

Quite apart from the inflationary impact, voluntary carbon markets are also fragmented and the quality of carbon credits, as pointed out by S&amp;P Global Platts, varies.</p><p>Singapore, which grapples with its own transition challenges, is stepping up to play a key role through the establishment of Temasek-backed Climate Impact X, a global carbon exchange and marketplace, later this year.

A leaders' summit on Nov 7 will set the pace for two weeks of negotiations to tackle difficult issues such as finance, decarbonisation, adaptation and farming practices. At the end, everyone will agree that this year's climate disasters show how little time is left to get on with the urgent task of keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Every delegate will be reminded of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' earlier warning: \"A third of Pakistan flooded. Europe's hottest summer in 500 years. The Philippines hammered. The whole of Cuba in blackout.\" And Hurricane Ian delivered a reminder that climate science is ignored at one's peril.</p><p> Yet, will all that hard bargaining that will go into a carefully crafted communique at meeting's end on Nov 28 really do anything? There's little room for optimism if past COP meeting outcomes are any guide. For instance, COP21 in 2015 delivered the Paris Agreement. It was hailed as the first legally binding treaty on climate change that committed 196 signatories to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. The rich countries promised to provide developing countries with US$100 billion a year for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020.</p><p> COP26 produced pledges on phasing out subsidies for coal and other fossil fuels. There was an agreement to halt clearing of the world's remaining forests and reverse land degradation. Even Brazil, home of the Amazon rainforest, signed on. The US and the European Union solemnly pledged to cut methane gas emissions, mostly from animal farming, by 30 per cent by 2030. The US and China, the world's top emitters of greenhouse gases, agreed to work in tandem to fight climate change over this decade. They vowed to work together on increasing the use of renewable energy. They also agreed to further develop and deploy carbon capture technology.</p><p> Looking back, these pledges look more like a catalogue of failures rather than milestones of progress. According to the Climate Action Tracker website, the world is still on track to hit 2.4 deg C of warming by 2100, which will not come as a surprise to any climate scientist. The annual US$100 billion promised for climate mitigation has never been met. Forests are still being cleared at an alarming rate. The outgoing Bolsonaro government in Brazil actually encouraged ranchers to clear the Amazon forests for cattle pasture during its time in office. Washington and Beijing are no longer talking to each other on climate matters (or on anything else, for that matter). And European priorities changed drastically once war broke out in Ukraine.</p><p> This is not to say that it is all for show. Last week the Climate Investment Funds, a partnership that channels concessional loans from the World Bank and other development banks, launched a US$2.5 billion coal transition investment programme.

Singapore is clear-eyed about the risks of climate change and takes the recent IPCC findings seriously. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) has started work on the Third National Climate Change Study, which will contextualise the IPCC findings and derive localised projections for Singapore.</p><p>2. The latest IPCC findings underscore the urgency to press ahead with our climate adaptation plans outlined under the 'Resilient Future' pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p><p>3. To address rising temperatures and the urban heat island effect, the Government has been developing a heat mitigation action plan, informed by science. This includes increasing urban greenery and green buildings and scaling up the use of cool materials. For example, the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB), together with the Tampines Town Council, have launched a pilot project to paint some 130 HDB blocks with cool paint to reduce ambient temperature. We are also intensifying greenery in our urban environment as part of our City in Nature efforts under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. For example, as part of our OneMillionTrees movement, we are planting 170,000 more trees in our industrial estates over the next 10 years, nearly tripling the current tree population. This can help to cool these industrial estates and create a more conducive work environment.</p><p>4. Climate change can also affect Singapore's biodiversity and natural ecosystem processes. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Plan 2025, NParks will lead research on the impact of climate change on terrestrial, coastal, and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Such research can guide our nature conservation efforts.</p><p>5. Another key area is strengthening Singapore's coastal protection and flood resilience. Site-specific studies to determine feasible measures for coastal protection are being carried out progressively, beginning with more critical and vulnerable regions such as the City-East Coast. PUB is also developing a Coastal-Inland Flood Model that can assess the combined flooding effects from extreme sea levels and intense rainfall.</p><p>5. To enhance flood resilience, PUB has invested almost $2 billion on drainage works in the last decade and will invest another $1.4 billion over the next five years. Drainage design standards were raised in 2011, which called for an increase in drain capacities by up to 50% to cater for more intense rainfall.</p><p>6. The Government will take a science-based and proactive approach to climate adaptation. The Government will review and update Singapore's long-term coastal protection plans based on the latest data, by adopting a flexible approach in planning protection measures and evaluating the plans across a range of scenarios. However, it will not be prudent or feasible to build infrastructure to accommodate every extreme climate scenario. The recent extreme climate events worldwide have highlighted that the collective response to such occurrences is just as important. We will seek to strengthen community resilience, in partnership with our local communities and stakeholders.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) has started work on the Third National Climate Change Study, which will contextualise the IPCC findings and derive localised projections for Singapore. 2. 3.

This underscores the importance of the topics that we are going to be discussing today, and the importance that you ascribe to sharing thought leadership, experience, ideas and innovation with one another.</p><p>3. I'd like to start by making a few words of thanks.</p><p>4. First to David and his team from Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS) for supporting and co-organising this year's conference with the Charity Council.</p><p>(a) Your team has helped us to reach out to a much wider audience, with more than 700 charity representatives here with us today.</p><p>(b) Some of your board members have also stepped up to become moderators and panelists for the Conference. The charities will benefit greatly from your very practical insights and experiences, bringing greater impact to the community and charity sector.</p><p>5. I want to also make a special thanks to the speakers and panelists for so generously coming forward to share your experience and to share your thought leadership.</p><p>6. This is really going to be an important and impactful conference.</p><p>7. I would also like to thank Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) for continuing to be this year's conference knowledge partner.</p><p>(a) Your expertise and commitment to education have been a tremendous asset to our charity sector.</p><p>(b) I think we need to make education a bedrock and a lifelong endeavour. We need to think of how we can constantly upgrade ourselves, how we keep ourselves knowledgeable and plugged into developments around the world.</p><p>8. Finally, I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the 9th Charity Council for your efforts in promoting good governance and accountability in the charity sector.</p><p>Currencies of Trust</p><p>9. I think it really goes without saying that openness, transparency, strong governance, accountability, these are all not just good to have concepts, but they are really the currencies of trust.</p><p>10. And without these currencies of trust, it will be very difficult for charities to have a good, open, working, beneficial relationship with the public.</p><p>11. It is really important that we stand by these principles and as we think about the different issues that we are confronted with today, and look at how we can remodel ourselves and improve, we must always keep these concepts as the foundational bedrock of what we want to achieve.</p><p>12. This morning I will speak on a few changes that we would like to see that will enhance our framework for good governance.</p><p>13. As I speak about them, you will see that what we are trying to do over the years as our charity sector matures, with more self-governance, with more rules of regulation, with lifting the standards overall of charities, we hope to be able to see a little bit of flexibility at the margins, so that the charities can be innovative and have a little bit of working room to start thinking of what they want to do out of the box.</p><p>14. I wanted to end my thanking section by also acknowledging the many who have stepped forward - stakeholders in the sector, those who have more experience or different experiences in the sector - to share ideas with us on how to strengthen Singapore's role as a philanthropy hub.</p><p>Achieving the highest governance standards is essential for charities to build trust and credibility with their stakeholders</p><p>15. Let me first start with the fundamental point about achieving high governance standards.</p><p>16. With a maturing charity landscape and coupled with our efforts over the years to strengthen trust and promote good governance in the charity sector, the Government has moved towards a more balanced disclosure regime for house-to-house and street collections for registered and exempt charities.</p><p>(a) This new regime aims to strike a balance between the need for transparency and accountability, and the need to minimise the administrative burden on charities.</p><p>(b) We recognize that sometimes in trying to put top-down rules governing charities, while it is very good, but at the same time it can cause a big burden on smaller charities. We are very mindful of this, very conscious, and what we want to do is to try to strike a very good balance achieving both at the same time.</p><p>(c) Therefore, it is important that there are still safeguards to help members of the public make informed decisions about their donations.</p><p>(d) Remember that I said that trust with the public is one of the key foundational pillars of a charity's relationship with the public</p><p>(e) Charities are self-encouraged to put in place adequate processes and internal controls to ensure compliance with the disclosure regime when conducting public fund-raising appeals.</p><p>(f) By working together, we can ensure that charities will be able to operate effectively and efficiently, while also maintaining the trust and confidence of the public.</p><p>Philanthropists seek to contribute more as they see opportunities to create meaningful change</p><p>17. Second, the philanthropy landscape in Singapore has been evolving over the years.</p><p>(a) There is a growing interest in impact investing and social entrepreneurship, with an emphasis on greater collaboration and deeper partnerships and an increasing focus on diversity, sustainability, and inclusivity.</p><p>18. In this landscape, grantmakers play a significant role in the overall philanthropic sphere and contribute to the national drive to build a more caring and inclusive Singapore.</p><p>19. They support charities by providing financial support, advocating for change, and providing guidance and expertise in many cases.</p><p>(a) For example, Quantedge Advancement Initiative, has supported our local university to conduct research on climate adaptation and develop essential tools that enable organisations to make informed decisions on when and how nature-based adaptation measures are important in mitigating the upcoming and ongoing climate threats.</p><p>20. As part of developing Singapore as a regional Philanthropy Hub, the COC's office will be making changes to the existing Guidance on Regulation of Grantmakers that includes the following:</p><p>(a) Retaining the current guideline of requiring Grantmakers to \"apply some of their funds in Singapore\", without hardcoding a minimum percentage.</p><p>(b) Allowing the conduct of non-grantmaking activities, limited to 10% of the Grantmaker's activities and subject to certain safeguards; and</p><p>(c) Allowing disbursements through non-grant instruments (e.g., social impact bonds, loans), limited to 10% of the Grantmaker's activities and subject to certain safeguards.</p><p>21. These changes help to promote the good work of grantmakers, giving them a little bit of flexibility, as I mentioned at the outset, but still fundamentally maintaining the core principle of transparency, governance, and strong sense of accountability.</p><p>22. These changes will clarify the parameters of the scheme and ensure that our regulatory framework remains relevant and effective in supporting the good work of our Grantmakers.</p><p>23. These changes will come in force at the start of next year.</p><p>Launch of the revised Risk Management Toolkit</p><p>24. Second, let me talk a little bit about the Risk Management Toolkit, which I am sure many of you are familiar with, or if not, you should be familiar with.</p><p>25. All innovation, all change, and whenever you try to push the envelope or try to be out of the box, they do come with a little bit of risk and because you are doing something differently from before, there is sometimes no precedent for it.</p><p>26. Such change in innovation should not be stifled, and we should be looking at how we can promote change in innovation from a ground-up perspective.</p><p>(a) Charities that are willing to innovate, push the boundary, push the envelope, try new things are often better positioned to address evolving social issues and thereafter make a positive impact on them.</p><p>(b) However, it is also important at the same time to strike a balance, to manage these risks carefully and effectively, at the same time keeping in mind the fundamental ethos that charities must all subscribe to.</p><p>27. Having a strong risk management framework can empower charities to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks that could impact their own operations, reputation, and also their financial performance.</p><p>28. A Risk Management Toolkit for charities was first developed in 2016 to guide charities on their journey towards better risk management.</p><p>29. With challenges from COVID-19, economic uncertainty, and ongoing and increasing geopolitical conflict, charities are themselves facing more demanding risks that require a broader and more effective risk management strategy, which also looks at some of the evolving paradigms that we see the sector is facing today.</p><p>30. An extensive Risk Management Survey for Charities was conducted early this year.</p><p>(a) I want to thank all respondents who participated so positively and actively in the survey.</p><p>(b) The findings tell us that there has been a significant improvement in the sector as compared to the 2016 survey.</p><p>(c) However, most charities are still establishing the foundations of a sustainable risk management programme and need more guidance on their journey.</p><p>31. As such, the Charity Council, KPMG Singapore, and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) have developed a supplementary risk management toolkit for the charities.</p><p>(a) It provides the 'next steps' guidance to improve and mature charities' Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) practices.</p><p>(b) It is designed as a supplement to the 2016 Risk Management Toolkit for charities, and additional templates have also been included.</p><p>32. The toolkit looks specifically at lessons learnt from COVID-19. We also deal with new and emerging risks such as ESG and climate risks which charities are now increasingly more concerned with.</p><p>33. Charities have to be constantly updated and evolved so that we can also understand and meet the needs of society's challenges today.</p><p>34. This toolkit will be put in place, but at the same time, this is not the end of the toolkit. We will continue to keep an eye out for such emerging trends and consequently new risks that may arise, and from time to time, we might continue to update this toolkit.</p><p>35. At the same time, with the toolkit in place, charities need make their own business continuity management programmes (BCP) . We need to look at this more seriously, because the pandemic, if there is one lesson from that, has shown us that we could be faced with an unexpected crisis of all sorts.</p><p>(a) What we need in such times of crisis is for a strong BCP to be in place so that there is assured continuity and stable platform for the programmes to continue.</p><p>(b) Our beneficiaries won't be affected adversely, and there will be a lot more stability. It should be framed in peacetime like now, so that when we are hit with an unexpected crisis, we will be able to confidently rely on an established protocol and a framework in the BCP that we can immediately trigger.</p><p>Charities' best qualities are exemplified by their dedication to service and kindness</p><p>36. Finally, before I conclude, I want to say a few words about Forward SG.</p><p>37. For the past year, Singaporeans have been actively, proactively in many cases, sharing their vision of what a future Singapore would look like, not just a future Singapore that they want to see because of policy, but how can they participate proactively in making a future Singapore go from an aspiration to a reality.</p><p>38. That really is the core of the Forward Singapore exercise.</p><p>39. A couple of weeks ago, we finalised our report, we launched it, we explained what the six pillars of Forward SG stand for, how they interact with one another, and how they become the foundational pieces of a new Singapore and the plans for a new social compact in Singapore.</p><p>40. At the heart of the social compact is the idea or the notion that we all have a responsibility to contribute to the well-being of our communities.</p><p>41. It is the idea that no one exists as an island, that we are all interconnected, that we all can and should contribute to the well-being of one another. And the fundamental idea is that in order for us to make Singapore truly inclusive and accessible, all of us have a role in doing that.</p><p>42. This concept applies, if not equally, much more strongly in the charity sector.</p><p>43. The charities embody this idea entirely, each and every one of you, in the work that you do, and in the beneficiaries that you touch daily. Your work complements the government's efforts to help foster greater social cohesion, a sense of belonging, a sense of community through volunteerism and community service.</p><p>44. All of you run organisations that in itself might be small or large, but collectively the social impact is tremendous, creating a very positive societal impact.</p><p>(a) The Government will commit to continuing to provide opportunities and assurances for charities and communities to contribute in your own way. We recognise that we want you to contribute in your own way, because each of your charities, each of your beneficiaries, you are all serving a different sector of society, and collectively we can become greater than the sum of our parts.</p><p>45. We want to do this to nurture a stronger culture of giving, especially among those who have done well in our society, better connect donors and volunteers to local community needs, thereby strengthening our multiracialism, our intrinsic quality of diversity, and greater interaction between different groups because charity knows no colour, creed or religion.</p><p>46. As a result of doing all this, to create a lot more avenues for ground-up participation, opportunities for us to step up to contribute and to make a greater impact than we can do on our own.</p><p>47. I hope that we can all think about what you do, the work that you do in the context of the Forward Singapore ideals and philosophy, and think of how we can come together to really build a truly caring, inclusive, resilient society for Singaporeans.</p><p>48. On that note, I want to just underscore the point I made right at the start, much as we want to move forward, evolve, look at developing trends in Singapore, at the core of what we need to get right is openness, accountability, and I would say, utmost scruples when it comes to scrutiny.</p><p>49. When we can assure the public of this, we will have a tremendous foundation on which to move forward with our programmes. Let us not shy away from scrutiny, but welcome it as an opportunity to learn, to improve, to innovate and to do better.</p><p>Closing: Together, we can make a positive impact through greater governance and accountability.</p><p>50. In closing, I hope this conference will give you some exposure to different learning, different experiences, thought leadership, and share ideas.</p><p>51. I think what is most important too, if you look around the room today, we come from different and diverse sectors, and a range of different experiences.</p><p>52. I hope that you also walk away from today with more networks, more friendships, more connections, because when we can do that and we can bring our charity sector together, then I think we will really be in a strong position to make a real positive impact.</p><p>53. Collectively, this charity sector will rise up in terms of the quality, uplifting each and every one of the charities to be able to serve Singapore and Singaporeans much better.</p><p>54.

It is a great privilege to join you at the World Sustainability Forum. I would also like to say a big hello to all the friends who are joining us virtually.</p><p>2. This year's World Sustainability Forum is held in Singapore for the first time, and also in Basel and Toronto. This global focus is appropriate because the effects of climate change can be felt worldwide, and presents an existential threat to all of humanity.</p><p>3. Indeed, Switzerland, Canada and Singapore have all experienced the impacts of rising global temperature. A Swiss weather balloon had to climb to an unprecedented 5,300 metres before temperatures fell to 0 degrees Celsius. This surpassed the previous record of 5,184 metres, which was set just a year ago. Since surveys began, the zero-degree line has risen between 200 to 700 metres, depending on the season. The zero-degree line is a key meteorological marker. Its rise demonstrates how the global water cycle has been impacted by climate change. Canada has been affected by an ongoing, record-setting series of wildfires beginning in March. According to scientists, these fires were made at least twice as likely by climate change. Singapore, too, has not been spared. In fact, we experienced the highest recorded temperature of 37 degrees Celsius in the last 40 years in May this year. And this decade is the warmest decade that we are experiencing.</p><p>4. What this shows is that climate change does not impact us in silos. Rather, it impacts all of us, which underscores the importance of partnerships, both domestically and internationally, to tackle climate change.</p><p>Supporting Climate Science</p><p>5. As a global community, we must continue to support the science of climate change, so that we can better understand its effects, and how we can mitigate or adapt. We are happy to have Associate Professor Winston Chow elected to the IPCC, or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This is just one way to show how Singaporeans are making an impact globally, and also having that connection to the rest of the global community. The IPCC prepares the Assessment Reports about the latest state of scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change, its impacts and risks, as well as options for mitigating the pace of climate change. As IPCC's Co-Chair for Working Group II, Prof Chow will contribute towards international efforts to assessing the impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities related to climate change.</p><p>6. The work that the IPCC does helps us with knowledge accumulation, to understand the regional and local impacts of climate change. In Singapore, this has been the focus of the Centre of Climate Change ResearchSingapore (CCRS) since it was established in 2013. More recently, CCRS is completing our Third National Climate Change Study (or V3), incorporating the latest findings from the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report.</p><p>7. These findings will produce an updated set of localised projections of key climate variables, such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, winds and sea level, for Singapore and the Southeast Asia region up to 2100 and beyond. This will be used to guide Singapore in many important areas, such as understanding the localised impact of climate change, as well as developing and reviewing our climate adaptation policies and plans. Internationally, Singapore will also be progressively sharing V3 data through platforms such as the climate impacts assessment tools of the UN Food &amp; Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to enable users to conduct more detailed assessments of the impact of climate change on agriculture. Countries in the region can share information and equip themselves better in understanding the effects of climate change. We have been offering these data through various ASEAN platforms and many of our counterparts have indicated interest to understand the impact of climate change from the IPCC, brought down to the Southeast Asia region.</p><p>Developing Climate Strategies</p><p>8. Understanding the impacts of climate change informs our climate strategies for areas such as heat stress and coastal protection.</p><p>9. As temperatures rise, it is important that Singaporeans are well equipped to protect ourselves and our loved ones. My Ministry launched the Heat Stress Advisory to help our general population make more informed decisions on undertaking prolonged outdoor activities, so that they can minimise the risk of heat stress and heat-related illnesses. For our attendees from Singapore, I encourage you to check the myENV app for the Heat Stress levels when planning for outdoor activities. Please share with your friends and family about the Heat Stress Advisory, and encourage them to download the myENV app! Sometimes in Singapore, we take our weather for granted because we are always in the tropics and the range of temperatures is consistent. But there are new factors that require us to be more sensitive to the weather, and we need to have the humility to acknowledge what the weather can do to our well-being. It is good to be more sensitive, to read up about weather forecasts, and to have that sense of awareness that can help us navigate through different weather conditions. Make it a habit, as you do in other countries, to pay attention to weather forecasts before you go out in Singapore.</p><p>10. Last week, I attended the launch of our Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute, or CFI. We had earlier announced PUB, Singapore's Water Agency's, new $125 million Coastal Protection &amp; Flood Management Research Programme and establishment of a Centre of Excellence to conduct coastal science research. CFI Singapore will facilitate the development of knowledge to support the various workstreams that PUB has embarked on to protect our coastlines, and harness expertise from our Institutes of Higher Learning.</p><p>Driving Sustainable Solutions through Partnerships</p><p>11. You may ask, does SUSS have a role? You definitely have a role, because when you look at adaptation, community and societal responses are absolutely important. Engineering solutions will not be effective unless communities embrace it, unless societies are able to live with the new adapted environments. In this process of change and getting ourselves ready, it is important for us to look at issues such as behavioural change for heat stress. We want this adaptation to be an inclusive one, and the societal aspect of it - to study the impact of all these adaptations on society, on humans, on communities, is an important part of our research programme.</p><p>12. Now that I have shared about the \"brainy\" topic of climate science, we need to go to the \"heart\" of the issue - how can we rally the community to work together to drive sustainable solutions?</p><p>Rallying the Community</p><p>13. In Singapore, we recognise the need for a Whole-of-Nation approach to rally the community and promote sustainability. To this end, my Ministry launched Go Green SG in July this year to strengthen partnerships and galvanise collective action for environmental sustainability. More than 160 partners organised over 300 activities, programmes and experiences for over 70,000 participants.</p><p>14. And it is not just the Government that decides how Singapore tackles climate change. Our people, too, have a say, and we need all hands on deck. As part of our Forward SG movement, we have engaged over 2,200 Singaporeans from businesses, non-governmental organisations, schools and the community. A key theme of the conversations was the challenges and trade-offs that Singapore must balance when it comes to environmental sustainability.</p><p>Partnerships to drive sustainable solutions</p><p>15. Besides rallying the community, partnerships are key to drive sustainable solutions that will have social and community impact - the focus of our forum today. For example, we have partnered with researchers to advance science-based solutions, to issues such as urban heat in Singapore, more closely. The Cooling Singapore 2.0 project led by the Singapore-ETH Centre is developing a digital model to simulate our urban climate and assess the effectiveness of various heat mitigation strategies. This enables us to understand urban heat in Singapore better and identify cost-effective heat mitigation strategies.</p><p>16. Our SG Eco Fund supports ground-up solutions for a greener and more sustainable Singapore. For the most recent grant call, about 80 sustainability projects were awarded $2.4 million.</p><p>17. The broad range of projects will help us to move towards our climate and Green Plan goals. Carolin Barr, who will be speaking next, is the founder of susGain, a recipient of the SG Eco Fund. The SG Eco Fund supported susGain to develop a 6-week gamified app challenge to champion schools to act on their commitment to reduce, recycle, reuse, and repurpose. I hear that the school communities have learnt a lot and had much fun through the activities, both in school and through the app. It is heartening to see many others like susGain, coming forward to go green in their own ways. If you have an idea for a project that supports environment sustainability and involves the community, I encourage you to apply for the SG Eco Fund, and be a part of Singapore's growing sustainability movement. This is really a good space for SUSS, where the science has to meet the people. We need a very fundamental change in mindset when it comes to protecting the environment. SUSS, through your faculty and students, has the ability to impact in getting the ground to be ready for this movement, to get mindset change and behavioural change.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>18. In conclusion, we can all make important contributions for sustainability. As individuals, we can encourage our friends and families to make simple changes to our everyday habits, such as by setting the air conditioning temperature to 25 degrees Celsius. Researchers can consider how to communicate your findings to the public more effectively, and pay greater attention to engaging the community. The example of susGain is really about communication and through gamification, causing change in behaviour. Businesses can lead the way by adopting more sustainable practices, tracking your carbon footprint and even setting a net zero target year.</p><p>19. In embracing sustainability as a core tenet of our collective vision, we can catalyse profound social and community impacts. Just as the challenge posed by climate change is multi-faceted, we need everyone on board to tackle it together. Forums like this one today can pave the way forward by sparking solutions for tomorrow.</p><p>20. I wish you all a very fruitful conference.

Voters were more concerned with the economy, healthcare, political stability, corruption and the cost of living.</p><p> Ms Raman said budget pressures from the economic impacts of the pandemic and inflation mean Malaysia should make a bigger push to access international green funding to help bankroll its climate action.</p><p> After the severe floods in late 2021, for example, Malaysia sought US$3 million from the donor-backed Green Climate Fund to develop a national plan to adapt to climate change.</p><p>Malaysia has a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, and the previous government's 2022 budget earmarked RM100 million (S$30.8 million) to help states protect forests and marine areas, up from RM70 million previously.</p><p> Ms Raman said greater financial incentives were needed for states whose economies largely rely on plantations of crops like durian, to help them stem forest loss.</p><p> The Prime Minister's Office did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p> Mr Renard Siew, a climate change adviser at Malaysian think-tank Centre for Governance and Political Studies, said many local green groups welcomed the quick decision to merge the natural resources and environment ministries.

She also shared about Singapore's partnership with fellow developing countries to enhance capacity building under the Singapore Cooperation Programme. The transcript of SMS Sim's speech is appended.</p><p>National Statement by Senior Minister of State For Foreign Affairs and National Development of Singapore Sim Ann at the Second Part of the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries</p><p>Mr President, Excellencies,</p><p>1. Let me first convey Singapore's appreciation to the Government of Qatar and the United Nations for organising this important meeting.</p><p>2. When we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, we made the fundamental commitment to \"leave no one behind\". We have now reached the critical mid-point of our journey. There is great urgency to reaffirm this core commitment and step up our efforts to address the needs and priorities of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).</p><p>3. In May last year, the UN Secretary-General warned that the \"very viability of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030\" is at risk. The LDCs are among those facing the greatest difficulties. They have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.</p><p>4. But there are also opportunities to \"rescue\" the SDGs as highlighted by the Secretary-General. This Conference is one such opportunity. We need to fulfil our commitment to the LDCs through concrete and collective action. Allow me to highlight four areas where we should focus our efforts: First, supporting climate resilience. The LDCs are the least responsible for climate change but are among the hardest hit. To help the LDCs build long-term resilience against the impact of climate change, we need to significantly scale up technical and financial support from the international community. In this regard, we strongly support the target of allocating 50 percent of climate financing to climate adaptation.</p><p>5. Second, closing the financing gap. Widening fiscal deficits and increased debt burden are hampering the ability of LDCs to eradicate poverty, respond to external shocks, invest in their people, and build inclusive societies. We must reform the global financial architecture to provide the scale and reliability of financing required to achieve the SDGs.</p><p>6. Third, accelerating digital transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital technology worldwide, but it has also laid bare the huge digital divide among and within countries. Only 25 percent of people in the LDCs use the Internet, compared to 80 percent in advanced economies. If we are serious about closing the digital divide, we will need to step up efforts to promote universal connectivity, enhance digital skills and training, and invest in digital infrastructure.</p><p>7. Fourth, strengthening global partnerships. Our experience with COVID-19 has shown that multilateral cooperation is the best way forward. Singapore strongly supports the Doha Programme of Action's call for a renewed and strengthened global partnership with South-South cooperation as an important pillar. Since 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme or SCP has been our platform for technical cooperation with developing countries. It originated as a way for Singapore to share our development experience and pay forward the assistance that we had received during our formative years. We have cooperated with UN agencies to deliver programmes in the Asia-Pacific and Africa. Our Third Country partnerships, including those with Chile, Japan, Qatar, Thailand, Trkiye, and the US, have facilitated North-South and South-South Cooperation. To date, we have welcomed close to 150,000 government officials as part of our SCP programmes, with more than 40 percent from the LDCs. This year, we will launch a three-year Sustainability Action Package to support capacity-building for all developing countries, focusing on resilience building strategies, green project management and financing, as well as carbon market development. We will continue to work with our partners to pool resources and expertise to better meet the needs of LDCs.</p><p>Excellencies,</p><p>8. As a global community, we must not leave anyone behind in our collective journey towards the SDGs. In line with the theme of this conference, \"From Potential to Prosperity\", let us work together to support the LDCs to realise their vast potential and achieve a prosperous future.</p><p>9.

I am happy to join you today to kickstart an exchange of views on sustainability, a topic of great resonance and importance not only to Singapore, but also the wider world</p><p>As we just heard from Kaylee, GAIL stands for \"Greening ASEAN: Initiatives and Leadership\".</p><p>This theme, of greening ASEAN, is relevant to countries both in the region and the world.</p><p>Climate change is an existential challenge of our times.</p><p>Today, all 10 ASEAN Member States are feeling the acute impact of a changing climate, be it through heatwaves and drought, or tropical storms and floods.</p><p>These extreme weather events are destroying infrastructure, disrupting economic activity, upending livelihoods, or worse taking lives.</p><p>So I commend the ONERHT Foundation for convening this Forum for the sixth time, to raise awareness and build momentum on putting sustainability into practice among your network of partners, stakeholders and clients.</p><p>The focus of this year's Forum - on energy, strategy and finance - is especially timely.</p><p>A study by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in 2022 identified insufficient financial resources, lack of R&amp;D, technology and expertise, and insufficient alternative energy resources as the top three obstacles to decarbonisation in ASEAN.</p><p>Even so, given the scale and depth of the climate challenge in our region, and indeed globally, we have no time to waste.</p><p>While we may not yet fully understand the effects of climate change, nor can we foretell the future, we must do what we can, now.</p><p>Left unchecked, the cumulative effects of climate change and rising sea levels could be even more severely damaging to all life on Earth.</p><p>I am glad that citizens in ASEAN recognise this.</p><p>In a survey conducted earlier this year across ASEAN, more than 57 percent of respondents ranked climate change as the region's second biggest challenge, after unemployment and economic recession.</p><p>As societies, we should collectively invest in sustainability as a priority, not just because it is fashionable or generates good returns today, but out of a sense of responsibility to future generations.</p><p>Indeed, we are but temporary custodians of this planet.</p><p>Let us be responsible stewards in the way we live, work, produce and consume, so as to hand over a healthy and functioning ecosystem to those who come after us.</p><p>To be effective and responsible stewards requires taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to sustainability, with the public, private and people sectors each playing our part and working together.</p><p>I am glad that you have brought together a diverse group - topical experts, regional practitioners, advocacy groups, businesses and investors - to discuss how we can work together to build a more sustainable world and a better future.</p><p>Now, how then should we think about stewarding a more sustainable future for ASEAN, and for the world?</p><p>Let me suggest four interlinking dimensions, using the \"GAIL\" acronym.</p><p>First, Galvanise.</p><p>In 2015, governments around the world negotiated the UN Paris Agreement and committed to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>8 years on, we are working diligently to deliver on this commitment. But there remains much to be done.</p><p>As a first step, governments should lay out a clear and deliberate vision to rally public support for a more sustainable future.</p><p>In Singapore, for example, we have published our Green Plan 2030 as a whole-of-nation sustainability roadmap, with clearly defined and concrete targets across sectors including energy, transport and infrastructure.</p><p>Several ASEAN governments have also outlined explicit targets for the achievement of net-zero emissions.</p><p>It will also be useful to have the world's two largest economies, the US and China, cooperate in leading the world in this green transition.</p><p>Now, in tandem, the private sector can also help to mobilise greater momentum for sustainability.</p><p>Businesses are increasingly setting out their own net-zero targets, to support national sustainability goals.</p><p>I understand that ONERHT, for instance, has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.</p><p>As Environment and Social Governance, or ESG, metrics gain greater prominence in investment and risk assessments, corporates will need to clearly articulate their core principles and metrics.</p><p>The ONERHT Foundation's G.R.A.C.E principles - Governance, Risk management, Anti-money laundering, Compliance and Ethics - are one such good example.</p><p>Such frameworks give businesses a common base understanding from which to map out their sustainability strategies, assess the progress they have made over time, and redeploy resources and expertise if necessary.</p><p>So that's the first \"G\", Galvanise.</p><p>Second, Accelerate.</p><p>As a region, ASEAN will need an estimated US$3.1 trillion in infrastructure investment alone between 2023 and 2030 to sustain economic growth, reduce poverty and respond to climate change.</p><p>It is unlikely that governments on their own can meet such high investment demands, especially amid prevailing global economic uncertainties.</p><p>The private sector and philanthropies can therefore help to unlock new green transition opportunities by crowding in private and other forms of capital to augment public expenditure.</p><p>Philanthropic capital, in particular, can be deployed via blended finance instruments to support high-risk investments and make projects more commercially viable.</p><p>This can have a powerful demonstrative effect that sustainability can be a profitable investment theme.</p><p>And in turn, this could draw more investment for sustainability-related projects.</p><p>Third, Innovate.</p><p>Stewarding ASEAN towards a more sustainable future will require significant innovation and technological breakthroughs, to lower the costs and raise the benefits of the green transitions required.</p><p>Within ASEAN, we can explore suitable options in renewable energy, reusable plastics, nature-based solutions and other innovations.</p><p>Besides mitigation and reducing emissions, we can also explore solutions for climate adaptation - to tackle problems relating to rising sea levels and food system disruptions.</p><p>ASEAN Member States should invest in R&amp;D and build closer cross-border scientific and research collaborations to harness one another's strengths.</p><p>For example, the National Research Foundation that I chair supports the Singapore Academies Southeast Asia Fellowship.</p><p>We have seen postgraduate researchers from the region do interesting work on emissions reduction, hydrogen storage and carbon capture.</p><p>But there is much more that we can do to meet ASEAN's collective climate aspirations.</p><p>And this brings me to the fourth dimension, Leap.</p><p>In particular, innovations and breakthroughs must be deployed at scale to achieve tangible impact over the long-term.</p><p>ASEAN currently has a combined population of 665 million people, and this is expected to grow to 717 million by 2030 and 741 million by 2035.</p><p>As a region, there is great potential for any new breakthroughs to be scaled up to achieve impact.</p><p>Over the years, we have made good progress on economic integration within ASEAN, to form a single production base and market.</p><p>By making it easier for businesses to test-bed solutions and to scale up, ASEAN not only has a better chance to make the green transition but can also serve as a pathfinder. In this regard, ONERHT's work in the region in providing a whole range of services will be valuable.</p><p>And we must also learn from and collaborate with partners around the world, to make the green transition together.</p><p>So, the ONERHT Foundation has taken a similar collaborative approach, bringing together different stakeholders and partners to work together.</p><p>Today, you are taking a further step by launching the ethBe (eth-bee) platform.</p><p>This platform will build awareness and grow a community of ethical leaders under the G.R.A.C.E framework.</p><p>Podcasts, curated content and capacity building programmes will help lay the foundation for a culture of sustainability stewardship by building greater expertise in relevant areas like carbon accounting and the assessment of domain risk.</p><p>By tapping on the ONERHT Foundation's network of partners and clients, ethBe will also help to build a sustainability ecosystem to foster closer collaboration and amplify the impact of individual initiatives.</p><p>Such ground-up initiatives by the private sector will be useful in reinforcing efforts by ASEAN governments to mobilise greater climate and sustainability action.</p><p>In conclusion, let me reiterate the importance of treating sustainability not only as a priority for the present, but as part of the legacy that we will bequeath to future generations.</p><p>Building and preserving this legacy rests on all our shoulders - government, business, and the people sectors alike.</p><p>It is the actions we take today, individually and collectively, that will determine the kind of world we hand over to our children, and their children.</p><p>Forums like this one today are important to bring interested stakeholders from different backgrounds and expertise to exchange experiences, cross-pollinate ideas, and to seed fruitful collaborations.</p><p>So I encourage all of us here today to make the most of the presentations and panel discussions that follow, and may you leave today with fresh inspiration on how we can be responsible stewards for the planet to build a better world and a better future.</p><p>So I wish you all a fruitful Forum.

Regulation, technologies and initiatives must be implemented quickly for maximum impact.\"</p><p> Feng says greater collaboration through public-private partnerships is needed, along with genuine representation from developing countries most at risk of the consequences of climate change, to drive forward efforts to decarbonise. \"Science tells us it's time for everyone to do their part to limit the impacts of the climate crisis on our planet, and global partnership-driven initiatives play a crucial role in ensuring a secure future. No organisation, government, or institution can do it alone.\"</p><p> Pant believes that transformative policy change across more economies is urgently needed in order to decarbonise at the speed and scale required to achieve net-zero by 2050. \"This is because action from governments can accelerate even more action from companies,\" he said.</p><p> Aubertin-Noel agrees: \"Global companies can make an impact not only on the countries where they operate, but also on their ecosystem, such as the social and economic fabric, to influence consumers to make smarter, more eco-conscious choices.\"</p><p> Pant adds that technology will play a key role in aiding such efforts: digitisation, powered by the Internet of Things, can help companies create achievable targets for a greener future and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, while technological solutions can also help rural communities to become more productive, efficient and increase their local revenues. \"Apart from efforts by local governments, corporates too have a vital role to play in enabling access to energy and allowing energy-poor populations to develop in a sustainable way,\" he said.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["\"This includes rethinking approaches to energy and reducing carbon emissions drastically by establishing more sustainable practices,\" he said. Efforts to adapt But just as important as addressing the cause of climate change, through mitigation efforts such as decarbonisation, is the need to adapt to the effect of climate change - by changing the way we live. Adaptation solutions also abound in urban planning - an area in which governments and corporations can unite their efforts; these can take the form of climate-proofing infrastructure or greening buildings.

The combination of climate adaptation and mitigation can allow us to prepare for the worst and achieve our sustainability ambitions. Singapore has set a vision to become a leading centre for sustainable finance and carbon solutions in Asia and globally. While we have made headway, what more can Singapore do to stand out as a regional hub'</p><p> Sustainable finance: a vital part of the region's decarbonisation and transition storyVarious measures under the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Green Finance Action Plan have helped lay a strong foundation for the development of a sustainable finance ecosystem here. Singapore itself has committed to issuing up to S$35 billion sovereign green bonds by 2030. The city state can seek to deepen its sustainable financing capabilities by fostering an enabling environment to scale sustainable finance in the region. This can include developing and implementing credible transition finance frameworks and taxonomies, two areas which the financial services industry is currently grappling with. Refinements to capital risk charges with respect to green and sustainable finance may also help move the needle to deepen the market, including benefiting more small and medium enterprises (SMEs). </p><p>Singapore is also well-placed to be a regional blended finance hub bringing different stakeholders from the private and public sector together to fund and participate in climate-related projects, such as through means of risk-absorbing capital, guarantees, viability gap grants, and project development funds. To bring this into play, the Republic can continue to double down on opportunities to work with neighbouring governments, and be part of their sustainability value chain -- for example, by supporting their renewable energy developments which in turn can help address Singapore's rising energy demands. Expanding our role in blended finance can also help support the region in much-needed adaptation measures. </p><p> Opportunities to lead in climate techTechnology solutions, such as those centred on carbon capture, removal, utilisation, and storage, can help accelerate the energy transition. Offering incentives for early-stage investments into climate tech solutions can create value and impact where it matters most.</p><p> The newly introduced Enterprise Innovation Scheme offers a 400 per cent tax deduction for the first S$400,000 of qualifying costs such as R&amp;D, IP acquisition, registration and licensing, and training costs. Businesses may opt to convert the tax deductions into cash, with the cash payout capped at S$20,000 a year. Encouraging early-stage investments into climate tech solutions can strengthen Singapore's global relevance in sustainability.</p><p> To further encourage ESG-linked businesses large and small throughout the environmental, social and governance (ESG) value chain to set up shop in Singapore while nudging local companies towards greener solutions, Singapore can consider an ESG-conducive tax incentives and grants regime. </p><p> Currently, tax incentives such as the Development and Expansion incentive (DEI) and Global Trader Programme (GTP) offer concessionary tax rates of 5 per cent or 10 per cent to qualifying companies. While these incentives are broad enough to cater to ESG businesses, in many cases ESG firms may not fit squarely within these schemes due to their business model and size. These tax incentives could be more flexible. Their eligibility thresholds should be suitably adjusted to support desired ESG businesses such as carbon credits/offsets traders, exchanges, brokers and other sustainable solutions providers.</p><p> Furthermore, while grants relating to ESG businesses are already available, these tend to be focused on encouraging investments to improve energy efficiency. It would be helpful if the grants could be expanded to support broader ESG ecosystem development such as ESG measurement, reporting and training. While there is good support through the Enterprise Sustainability Programme to help organisations kick-start their sustainability efforts, businesses need more support to develop capabilities related to carbon measurement, decarbonisation and sustainability reporting. </p><p> Given the complex nature of sustainability issues, including the sector specificities, it would be timely to introduce more granular and tailored training to help build capabilities across sectors, enabling new jobs and roles. </p><p> With the ambiguities in navigating the ESG space, businesses would welcome certainty and stability in the tax environment, which Singapore can offer. For example, the amendment made to the GST treatment of a sale of carbon credits (from 7 per cent GST to no GST) in November 2022, and the related clarifications published by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras), provide certainty and clarity which businesses appreciate (notwithstanding that many had hopes for a zero-rated GST treatment which would allow GST on expenses to be fully claimable). Meanwhile, there remains ambiguity on the GST treatment of other ESG-related instruments such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and the related Contract for Differences. To this end, there remains scope for further policy and legislative review to fine-tune the GST treatment.</p><p> While companies may find it hard to navigate tax incentives and grants, the good news is studies have proven that these schemes can lead to a win-win of decarbonisation plus the added bonus of improving profits. They should also help to improve the overall bankability of green projects.</p><p> Amid the international push towards a global minimum tax, ESG-related grants are particularly relevant as there is potentially less scope to use tax incentives to attract new ESG-linked investments and strengthen the city's ESG ecosystem.</p><p>Singapore has been ambitious in its sustainability efforts despite the pandemic crisis. To continue to maintain its leadership in sustainability, continual policy calibrations will be needed to respond to changing environmental, societal and economic needs.

These meetings address progress on global efforts to battle climate change, and are attended by heads of state, ministers, climate activists, civil society representatives and business leaders. Cop27, which will be the 27th such conference, will be held from Nov 6 to 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Why it matters The conference is arguably the highest-level gathering focused on combatting climate change, and throws a spotlight on governments' commitments on this front. Such commitments are coming under ever-greater scrutiny as the world's climate crisis grows more dire. </p><p>The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body for assessing the science related to climate change, said earlier this year that the world is headed towards unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades and stressed the necessity of urgent action. Given the attention surrounding the conference, many private-sector organisations use the opportunity to announce new developments at the event. What Cop27 hopes to achieve Egypt has declared its aim to make this year's conference an \"implementation Cop\" by urging action across prior agreements through all areas of climate change needs and dealing with the issue of how the world will pay for the estimated US$125 trillion bill to tackle climate change by 2050. This, while keeping the focus on enabling a just and managed transition to a sustainable economic model, and \"ensuring that no country or group is left behind\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pronouncement that will be tested as the world observes how and if richer nations will come to the aid of their poorer counterparts. Much of the focus will also be on countries' efforts to deliver on the landmark Paris Agreement that came out of Cop21 in 2015. Then, 196 parties agreed to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, by cutting their greenhouse gas emissions until they reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding agreement that works on a five-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by signatories. These plans are known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). What to expect from Asia The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) recently published a report that analysed the NDCs of most major Asian countries and found that many still lack details in terms of how they intend to reach their emission-reduction targets. EIU is expecting a softening in ambition from Asia as the region deals with energy costs and security in the fallout of the war in Ukraine: China, despite being the global leader in renewable energy investments, will likely maintain a soft approach towards the fossil fuels needed to fuel its massive economy in the short to medium term; the mainland has in recent months encouraged higher domestic coal production to ensure energy security and stable economic growth; India and Indonesia will remain major coal consumers in the next decade, while pushing for greater funding from the developed world for supporting their clean-energy transition; Japan and South Korea will remain committed to transitioning to a low-carbon economy, but recent energy market turbulence has renewed their governments' focus on energy security, which is likely to mean more support for nuclear energy in both countries. EIU said it foresees that developing Asian countries such as India and Indonesia will find it difficult to secure meaningful commitments at Cop27 from the developed world to finance their energy transition, given the volatile economic and geopolitical environment. \"The lack of sufficient mitigation finance, a monetary tightening cycle in major Western economies and high material costs for renewable projects will make energy transition costlier. This will result in countries showing greater resistance to wean themselves off dirty fuels such as coal, and could weaken the climate policy stance taken by developing Asia at the conference,\" it added. It also expects that recent extreme weather events in Europe and the US will shift domestic public sentiment in these countries towards channelling climate adaptation funds towards domestic needs before committing to assist other countries, which will be detrimental to negotiations on providing financial support for developing Asian countries.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["\"The lack of sufficient mitigation finance, a monetary tightening cycle in major Western economies and high material costs for renewable projects will make energy transition costlier.

A map of the world with countries scaled to match their annual CO2 emissions betrays a bloated Global North and a squeezed South. Unlike a mirror at a funfair that makes us laugh at some impossibly distorted version of reality, this reflection speaks a sobering truth -- of global inequity, of haves and have-nots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Faced with the wicked problem of tackling climate breakdown -- detailed in the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) -- and reducing carbon emissions, we could see the challenge as one primarily confronting the Global North. Indeed, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the Paris Agreement's central mechanism for facilitating national commitments to reducing emissions, frame decarbonisation of the global economy as a task mostly for countries with high emissions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But even if NDCs were ambitious enough to deliver net-zero emissions by 2050, they would still only address the half of the problem that is already manifest -- but not the half that lies ahead.</p><p> Small today, big tomorrowWhile the Global South may be a small emitter today, it is also where most projected increases in the global population will occur, with millions aspiring to better lives. No one can rightly deny this aspiration -- \"leave no one behind\" is the transformative promise of the UN Sustainable Development Goals -- but historically, income growth has been strongly connected with higher per capita carbon emissions.</p><p> Substantial fossil fuel reserves and vast carbon storage in virgin forests in the Global South mean the potential for increased emissions is huge, and the Amazon has already become a source of carbon emissions rather than a sink for CO2. </p><p> Yet for the world to limit global heating to 1.5 deg C or even 2 deg C, most of the forests must be conserved, and fossil fuel reserves must remain untouched. This makes the challenge for the South -- of not \"carbonising\" while developing -- one at least as significant as decarbonising the North.</p><p> Countries in the South are also more vulnerable to climate risks. They will experience increased drought and flooding even if global warming is limited to 1.5 deg C, and need significant climate adaptation finance -- estimated to be between US$160 billion and US$340 billion by 2030, going up to US$565 billion by 2050 -- that enables them to face already inevitable climate impacts. In addition, realising the transition to net zero will rely on large capital flows from North to South, including through a range of incentives such as debt-for-nature swaps that help protect natural carbon sinks.</p><p> Optimistic technologists believe that emerging and developing economies in the Global South will be able to avoid the \"brown road\" to prosperity and leapfrog directly to a clean energy, net-zero future. This would magically eliminate any trade-off between growth and emissions, but it relies on richer countries quickly scaling clean technology, making it cheaper, and eliminating sizeable green premiums. </p><p> If technology does not eliminate these, the alternative is an approach long-favoured by economists: carbon pricing. But unfortunately, carbon taxes are deeply unpopular and have been taken off the table in key countries such as the United States.</p><p> How then can we reconcile and deliver on both decarbonising the North and forging a clean development path in the South'</p><p> The starting point lies in shifting from price-based solutions (carbon taxes) to quantity-based solutions (the remaining carbon budget). In terms of economic thinking, this means shifting from Pigou (pricing externalities) to Coase (cap, allocate rights and trade). </p><p> In practice, it means establishing a functioning and feasible global carbon credit market, as explored in Climate and Debt, the latest Geneva report on the world economy. This will not be easy, given that current markets are fragmented and embryonic, and participation is voluntary.</p><p> Firstly, to improve market functioning, mandatory carbon emissions reduction requirements must be put in place for all large emitters. Carbon credits must also be shown to be credible so that markets scale and prices rise to levels that reward countries and companies for preserving carbon sinks, developing nature-based solutions, and engaging in nature-positive business. There are various competing initiatives trying to bring transparency and accountability to the voluntary carbon markets.</p><p> Secondly, and more importantly, the world must squarely face the rapidly shrinking but increasingly alarming elephant in the room. According to the IPCC, if the average global temperature rise is to remain below 1.5 deg C with more than 80 per cent certainty, the world has a carbon emissions budget of just 300 gigatonnes of CO2. And with 50 per cent certainty, only 500 gigatonnes. </p><p> At current emissions levels, the budget will be exhausted in less than a decade. To be feasible, any system for allocating remaining emissions rights must be perceived as equitable. And so the question is, who should be allowed to \"use up\" the remaining budget'</p><p> NDCs implicitly suggest allocating the bulk of the remaining carbon budget to the biggest emitters in the North. At the other extreme, countries that have emitted the most in the past might receive only a small part of the remaining budget, which would immediately create a large carbon market. But neither of these approaches balances ethics with political realism in a way that is fair and effective.</p><p> A more balanced approach would be to distribute remaining emissions rights equally per capita across the globe, and then adjust them to account for past and future emissions opportunities. </p><p> For poor countries with large carbon sinks, for example, the opportunity costs of low future emissions are high, while those endowed with a wealth of natural renewable resources can more easily avoid future emissions. A robust global carbon market would then deliver the efficient use of the world's remaining emissions budget through global \"cap and trade\".</p><p> 'Just' dealingsAchieving global consensus for and establishing such an approach will take time, of which we have very little. A less ambitious -- but similar and more achievable -- approach is to greatly expand \"just energy transition partnerships\", in which rich countries cut a deal with poorer countries to pay for green technology in return for phasing out coal and leaving remaining reserves untouched.</p><p>Indonesia, for example, recently received US$20 billion from a coalition of rich countries through such a deal. Securing further timely deals like this would usefully complement a global deal through targeting priority emissions mitigation \"hot spots\" such as the Amazon rainforest.</p><p> President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil has called for the COP30 climate summit in 2025 to be held in the Amazon rainforest, an ecosystem vital for global climate stability. What better place for the world to turn things around, and what better milestone towards which our leaders might work to secure a step change on the road to net zero? </p><p> The writer is visiting professor at Insead and distinguished research fellow at Insead's Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society.

Over the years, our discussions at SDSWR have helped to catalyse action and cooperation towards making the agribusiness and forestry sectors in our region more sustainable. This year we will focus on the growing opportunities that come with a green transition in climate action.</p><p>El Nio Looms</p><p>3. Climate change has brought about more extreme and unpredictable weather patterns. Since April, Asia has experienced blistering heatwaves and historic high temperatures. Temperatures in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos broke new records. Likewise in Singapore, we experienced the highest recorded temperature of 37 degree Celsius in the last 40 years in May. According to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), global temperatures will likely reach new highs in the next five years, with a 98 percent chance that at least one of the next five years will be the warmest ever.</p><p>4. How will these sweltering conditions impact us?</p><p>We can expect disruptions in food production due to erratic yields, including outbreak of diseases such as the ongoing outbreak of bird flu and swine flu in parts of the world. This will have knock-on impacts on food prices, and livelihoods of people who are dependent on food and agricultural production.</p><p>We can expect more frequent power and water shortages. This will disrupt our social and economic activities. And lead to a vicious cycle of higher power needs due to greater use of air conditioners and water treatment equipment.</p><p>We can expect more forest fires from prolonged dry spells, and air quality impacted by these fires.</p><p>We can expect more cases of personal injury and loss of lives due to heat injuries. To help Singaporeans better protect themselves and their loved ones, my Ministry will implement a Heat Stress Advisory framework in the near future to guide us on how to plan our activities, what actions to take to protect ourselves and what attire to wear for outdoor activities for the forecasted weather conditions. Details on this advisory will be made available in the coming weeks.</p><p>5. Whilst we adapt and adjust to the warmer conditions to come in the next few months, we must not take our feet off the pedal of climate action. Staying within the 1.5 degree limit of global temperature rise is nothing short of an existential priority as time, tide and temperature await for no one. All of us can and must contribute to climate action.</p><p>6 Beyond heat, we must also remain vigilant against the risk of a return of transboundary haze. We have been lucky to enjoy haze-free conditions in Singapore for the past few years, partly due to favourable weather condition. But this condition is not expected to continue.</p><p>7. Last week, the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) announced the start of the dry season for the Southern ASEAN region, which notably began much earlier compared to previous years. The Meteorological ServiceSingapore also announced that there is a 70 to 80 percent chance of an El Nio event occurring this year. Similar forecasts have been issued by the meteorological agencies in the region.</p><p>8. As a region, we need to be extra vigilant against the widespread outbreak of land and forest fires, such as those experienced in Northern ASEAN earlier this year. The threat of transboundary haze is not an ASEAN challenge alone. Since Tuesday, northeastern United States and parts of eastern Canada have been experiencing transboundary haze as a result of wildfires in Northern Quebec.</p><p>Certainty in Uncertain Times</p><p>9. How do we address these challenges that lie ahead? I will make three suggestions: knowledge, leadership and partnership.</p><p>Knowledge</p><p>10. First, knowledge acquisition. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a global scientific panel that helps us understand climate change projections and impacts, and on the pathways and solutions to mitigate and adapt to the change. Through good research and scientific evidence, we can find ways and means to address the climatic challenges that we face in the years ahead.</p><p>11. Singapore has been contributing to the IPCC process and is prepared to do more. We have nominated Associate Professor Winston Chow from the Singapore Management University to serve as the developing country Co-Chair for IPCC Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, for the upcoming Seventh Assessment Report (AR7) Cycle that will commence this July. Having spent more than fifteen years researching climate adaptation and urban vulnerabilities, and contributing to the IPCC as the editor of AR6 report, Professor Chow is no stranger to the international scientific arena on climate. We are also collaborating closely with the WMO and its members. Our Director-General for Meteorological Services Ms. Wong Chin Ling has been successfully re-elected to the WMO Executive Council, as a representative of the South-West Pacific region.</p><p>12. Another area where climatic data and science is of interest to us is in food production, as part of our target to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally by 2030. The 30X30 Food Story aims to bolster our food security as we develop capacity and capability in climate-resilient agriculture practices in Singapore. We are rethinking and reshaping food production in Singapore through technologies such as climate resilient seed varieties, resource-efficient and circular urban farming concepts, biosecurity and disease management, and novel foods trials and regulations. Local companies such as GoFarm, ComCrop and Sustenir Agriculture are pushing the boundaries of nutrition and sustainability through hydroponics technology, use of solar energy and energy efficient technology, and water conservation technology.</p><p>Leadership</p><p>13. While knowledge and science help us frame issues, leadership requires us to act, particularly in making the hard decisions, dealing with trade-offs, and having the courage to do what is right, in a timely manner.</p><p>14. ASEAN has been doing this as part of its commitment to a haze-free region. Yesterday, I hosted colleagues from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand for the Twenty-Fourth Meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution. We have been convening this meeting annually to prepare for the dry season in our ASEAN subregion. We had a good discussion and recognised the various measures that have been put in place across the region to prevent and respond to the threat of land and forest fires.</p><p>15. As Chairman of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, Singapore has worked with ASEAN colleagues on developing the New Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation for Transboundary Haze Pollution, the New ASEAN Peatlands Management System, and the ASEAN Investment Framework. These will help guide the region to develop strategies and partnerships, as well as demonstrate our resolve to achieve our vision of a haze-free ASEAN region.</p><p>16. As ASEAN Chairman, Indonesia has also led the way in taking steps to transform the region. Initiatives such as the Forestry and Other Land Use Net Sink 2030 testify to Indonesia's continued resolve in combating deforestation and climate change. Singapore appreciates the strong leadership demonstrated by Indonesia as ASEAN Chair. We will work closely with Indonesia at all levels to prevent an outbreak of fires in our region, and stand ready to provide technical support if required.</p><p>Partnership</p><p>17. Finally, the green transition requires global and regional partnerships, notably in operationalizing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to set up high-integrity carbon markets, and introduce needle-moving low-carbon technologies and solutions, such as hydrogen.</p><p>18. Singapore is actively establishing partnerships to enhance our adoption of renewable energy. We signed an agreement to import renewable hydropower from Laos - our first renewable energy import - through Thailand and Malaysia. This is the first multilateral cross-border electricity trade involving four ASEAN countries. We hope that it serves as a pathfinder to more of such regional cooperation initiatives to support the global energy transition.</p><p>19. Green and transition finance is another dimension that will benefit from partnership. We must do more to reduce the barriers of capital flow to facilitate investments in this direction. One of such ways is in aligning our green taxonomies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is working with its regional counterparts to progressively develop an ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance to define and facilitate sustainable and transition activities in six focus sectors as a start, which include the agriculture and forestry sector. Version 2 of the ASEAN Taxonomy was recently published in March 2023 and include new features such as a coal-phase-out criteria - a global first for a regional taxonomy.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>20. This week has been an exciting series of sustainability and climate dialogues in Singapore, starting with the Singapore International Water Week Spotlight, Ecosperity, followed by the ASEAN Sub-Regional Meetings on Transboundary Haze Pollution, and rounding up with today's Dialogue.</p><p>21. Allow me to share two personal reflections. We are certain of climate change.</p><p>We are certain that human activity is the main cause of climate change. We are also certain that collaborative action is needed. This is why dialogue with global and regional partners, such as this, is pertinent in forging consensus and cooperation.</p><p>In order to have meaningful, long-lasting and impactful collaboration, we need to build trust and confidence among all stakeholders, so that we can better understand and accommodate the differing national contexts, perspectives and views from different segments of society. Only then can we forge global and regional agreements that can effectively address a global commons problem.</p><p>22. Allow me to leave the stage with an encouragement to all of us here. We know we have a serious problem, and that we are already late in addressing it. This is the time where human creativity, ingenuity and wisdom must not fail us as the livelihoods of our future generation is at stake. Therefore, we have act now.</p><p>23. With that, I thank Professor Tay and his team at the SIIA for convening the 10th edition of the SDSWR and look forward to hearing from our speakers and panellists on their perspectives.</p><p>24.
