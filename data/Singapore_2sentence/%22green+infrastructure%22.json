Its first project, Sentosa's now-defunct Volcano Theme Park, marked the beginning of a long and growing commitment to the city-state. Thirty-three years on, ChinaConstruction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd (CCDC) has firmly established itself as a key player in Singapore's urban story, credited with building 82,691 homes, major national infrastructure, and a reputation for quality, safety and sustainability. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now one of Singapore's leading contractors with the highest Building and Construction Authority (BCA) builder grade (A1) and over 280 industry awards, CCDC's growth has closely tracked Singapore's development. Beyond the numbers, however, the company measures success by the lives and communities shaped by its work. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> From its early days, CCDC has responded to Singapore's priorities. After its private residential debut in 1994, the company swiftly moved into the public housing space, winning its first HDB project in Bukit Batok that same year. Since then, it has delivered 48,984 HDB flats and 33,707 private homes. Today, one in 20 people here lives in a home built by CCDC. </p><p> Beyond housing, the company has extended its reach across the built environment, from educational institutions, commercial centres and healthcare facilities to transport infrastructure and even water management. Key milestones include the construction of Republic Polytechnic's Woodlands campus (2003-2006), which featured varied structural designs; the Canberra MRT Station (2015-2019), a technically challenging project that earned multiple safety and design awards; and the Tuas Water Reclamation Plant, its first foray into water infrastructure. </p><p> The developer's current portfolio includes high-profile, complex projects like Bukit Canberra, an integrated sports and community hub, and CanningHill Piers mixed development, its first large-scale, high-end project. </p><p> Responding to changing aspirationsCCDC's steady growth reflects not just Singapore's development needs, but also the evolving aspirations of its people. Singaporeans today are placing greater emphasis on quality of life, sustainability, and smart living, moving beyond traditional goals like material success or homeownership. This shift has created stronger demand for thoughtfully designed technology-enabled spaces that enhance everyday living in a modern urban environment. </p><p> This is visible in projects such as Oasis Terraces, a lushly vegetated waterfront hub in Punggol that integrates healthcare, retail, residential and transport within a green ecosystem. The development received acclaim locally and abroad, including an award at the World Architecture Festival.</p><p>CCDC has also been an early adopter of green building standards. It has built more than 70 BCA Green Mark-certified projects since 2006, many of which exceed minimum regulatory requirements. These include green rooftops and innovative natural lighting systems, all designed to minimise environmental impact while improving user comfort. </p><p> By prioritising and practising Green Mark building standards, CCDC proactively implements environment friendly construction methodologies, materials and systems.</p><p> Harnessing technology for transformationKey to CCDC's growth has been its push to modernise construction through technology. As early as 2014, it set up a dedicated Building Information Modelling (BIM) team and today deploys over 200 BIM specialists across its projects. The team works on full-scale 2D to 6D models to enable more precise planning and resource management, as it seeks to \"build twice and build wise\".</p><p> On the prefabrication front, CCDC has led the local adoption of Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) and Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA). Its Lake Grande project was Singapore's first reinforced concrete condominium using PPVC, significantly reducing build time and site waste. At Bulim Square, another ongoing project, the company is employing an advanced drilling robot, prefabricated MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) modules, and an integrated digital management platform. </p><p> The drilling robot showcased its precision and efficiency, completing complex tasks with minimal human intervention, thus significantly reducing labour costs and project timelines. According to CCDC, these technologies are not just about speed, they support higher build quality, better safety outcomes and reduced carbon emissions.</p><p> The company is also piloting smart micro-grid systems and battery energy storage technologies, while exploring AI-assisted inspection and construction automation. These initiatives align with Singapore's Smart Nation and Green Plan goals. </p><p> Investing in peopleCCDC's belief in building well extends to its people. With over 1,600 employees in Singapore, the company places strong emphasis on local hiring, skills development and workplace inclusion. Today, 94 per cent of its core management team are Singaporeans or permanent residents. </p><p> To equip its staff with the right qualifications and skills, the company implements a comprehensive annual training plan that includes both internal and external programmes. These initiatives aim to help employees stay current with industry standards and effectively support the increasing demands of CCDC's construction projects. The company also offers dual career tracks for professional and leadership development. </p><p>CCDC's active emphasis on safety and quality is also supported through dedicated training sessions, interactive site activities, and internal knowledge-sharing platforms like the \"EasyLearn\" series.</p><p> Community at the coreLooking beyond the bottom line, CCDC has invested heavily in building communities. This includes social outings for migrant workers, such as a recent Gardens by the Bay trip in partnership with The Salvation Army, and friendly badminton tournaments that encourage camaraderie and inclusion on site. </p><p> At Riviera MRT station, one of CCDC's ongoing projects, a vibrant community mural now brightens the space, featuring 18 artworks created by young artists from Greendale Primary, Horizon Primary, and the Punggol Shore neighbourhood. The company's commitment to community care extends even after construction is completed. Its Building Service Centres, for instance, handle post-handover support for HDB developments, reflecting its focus on resident satisfaction. In 2024, CCDC received the HDB Excellence Service Award for its work at Tampines GreenCourt and Woodleigh Village.</p><p> \"Passionate customer service is the cornerstone of our success. We emphasise empathy, active listening, and timely solutions, with the goal of building meaningful connections with residents,\" says a CCDC spokesperson.</p><p> Building ties across bordersCCDC's story is also about cross-cultural connection. As a wholly owned subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), CCDC has served as a ground-level bridge between Singapore and China for over three decades. </p><p> \"We believe that every project is not just a structure, but a bridge between people, ideas, and cultures. Delivering high-quality work, acting responsibly, and building lasting relationships is a meaningful way to support the broader Singapore-China partnership on the ground,\" says the company spokesperson. </p><p> This includes adapting innovations from China for local use and ensuring Singapore standards and culture are integrated into every delivery. The company also works closely with local suppliers and industry partners, promoting local procurement and inclusive business practices. </p><p>  Looking ahead, CCDC's priorities remain aligned with Singapore's national goals over the next decade. The company plans to deepen its role in key sectors such as healthcare, transport and green infrastructure, areas identified in the Singapore Green Plan 2030. </p><p> \"While we have played an active role in Singapore's residential and public construction landscape, we are now placing greater emphasis on landmark projects, which reflect the country's evolving infrastructure needs,\" says the CCDC spokesperson. </p><p> \"By introducing innovative products from our Group and adapting them to local needs, we aim to provide solutions that are sustainable, efficient, and suited to Singapore's urban vision.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["The company also works closely with local suppliers and industry partners, promoting local procurement and inclusive business practices.

Very good morning to all of you. Sa-wat-dee-krub.</p><p>2. It is a great privilege and a great pleasure to join you today for the 9 th Singapore Regional Business Forum (SRBF), in the vibrant city of Bangkok.</p><p>3. I am indeed very heartened to see such strong participation by companies from Singapore, Thailand, and the wider region, united all by one common goal: to strengthen business resilience and to seize new opportunities.</p><p>Strong Singapore and Thailand Partnership</p><p>4. This year's SRBF also holds a special significance - because we are commemorating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Thailand. The theme for this significant milestone is STRONG@60. It captures the essence of our longstanding bilateral relationship - which is a robust and resilient partnership. Ladies and gentlemen, the numbers speak for themselves:</p><p>a. Our bilateral trade reached over S$44 billion last year, which is a 6.4% increase from the year before. Thailand was Singapore's 9 th largest trading partner, and the third largest in ASEAN.</p><p>b. Since 2015, Singapore has consistently ranked amongst Thailand's top investors, and in 2024, we emerged as the largest foreign investor in Thailand.</p><p>5. However, beyond the numbers, it is our people and the business ties that form the foundation of this strong partnership. During my meeting with DPM Pichai this morning, he had asked, \"What drew Singapore entrepreneurs and businesses to Thailand?\" I responded that it was the people, the strong business ties, and the hospitality that really laid the foundation. I want to illustrate two examples and share them with all of you:</p><p>a. In the sustainable energy space, Keppel, in partnership with BCPG Public Company Limited, pioneered a first-of-its-kind district cooling system for the Samyan Smart City in Bangkok.</p><p>b. In the healthcare innovation space, Singapore-based CoNEX Healthcare's AI-powered patient monitoring solution, PreSAGE, has been adopted by several Thai hospitals. Using thermal imaging, machine learning and predictive algorithms, the system reduces falls amongst elderly patients and contributes towards Thailand's efforts to care for its ageing population.</p><p>6. At the 7th Singapore-Thailand Enhanced Economic Relationship (STEER) Ministerial Meeting earlier in March this year, we continue to forge partnerships in new areas. I witnessed the signing of five Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) which span the areas of e-commerce, consumer protection, fintech, and agri-trade, as well as the announcement of a refreshed workplan on intellectual property collaboration.</p><p>7. As Singapore and Thailand celebrate our success in the last 60 years, I hope that we can reflect not just on our shared path, but think ahead and look at how we can shape the next 60 years of our partnership.</p><p>Navigating a Complex Global Landscape Through Regional Collaboration</p><p>8. This is especially important at a time where the global environment is undergoing profound changes:</p><p>a. Geopolitical tensions are threatening to fragment trade flows;</p><p>b. Our supply chains are being reshaped;</p><p>c. Climate risks and the need for energy securities are accelerating;</p><p>d. Technological disruptions, especially with the increasing prominence of AI, are transforming how we live, how we work, and how we do businesses.</p><p>9.In the face of such volatilities and to navigate these uncertainties, I think it is sll the more important for trusted partners to come together and to collaborate both on the bilateral and regional level because that would be a critical way forward.</p><p>10.Amidst these challenges, ASEAN remains a critical anchor for stability and growth:</p><p>a.ASEAN's economy is projected to grow at 4.7% this year [1], and it remains on track to become the fourth-largest global economy by 2030.</p><p>b.ASEAN is home to more than 680 million people, with an expanding middle class that is also tech savvy. This will be a very powerful driver of innovation and consumption.</p><p>c.We are also seeing a reconfiguration of global supply chains that favour this region - especially in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p><p>11. Structural changes within ASEAN are also creating new engines of growth.</p><p>a.On the digital front, ASEAN is emerging as a global hub for digital finance and e-commerce. Digital payments alone are expected to surpass US$1 trillion in gross transaction value by 2025. [2] With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, these digital innovations are set to transform existing business models and create entirely new industries across various sectors.</p><p>b. On the green transition front, ASEAN's green economy could unlock an additional US$300 billion in annual revenue through the development of green infrastructure, modernising domestic and regional electricity grids, accelerating the electric vehicle ecosystem, and leveraging the region's rich natural assets to develop carbon markets. [3] This green transition is not only a tangible step towards creating and combatting the effects of climate change, but will also help to create new jobs and it can enhance our collective regional energy security. [4]</p><p>12.To unlock its full potential, all of us have to work together, both at the bilateral and regional levels. Thailand and Singapore have been strong advocates of regional economic integration.</p><p>a. Thailand as the Chair of the ASEANDigital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) plays a key role. Singapore will support Thailand in working towards an ambitious and forward-looking agreement by the end this year, that will enhance interoperability and inclusivity across ASEAN's digital economies. Singapore also welcomes Thailand's application to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).</p><p>b. To support ASEAN's green economy development and the longer-term energy vision, we also look forward to accelerating discussions on the ASEAN Power Grid, so as to achieve a more resilient and sustainable future for ASEAN.</p><p>Seizing Opportunities: A Call to Action for Businesses</p><p>13. What do they mean for Singaporean and Thai businesses? I want to humbly suggest that they present business opportunities in three areas.</p><p>14. First, it deepens trade and investment. There remains scope for our companies to forge closer partnerships in mutual areas of interests, such as in advanced manufacturing, fintech, agri-tech, and electric vehicles.</p><p>a. For instance, in the Fintech space, iFAST signed an MOU with Thailand's TSFC Securities Public Company Limited earlier this year to explore a fintech platform to facilitate access for Thai securities companies and other financial institutions. This will allow companies to seamlessly trade offshore bonds, with immediate executable pricing and full price transparency.</p><p>b.Riding on Thailand's interest in electric vehicles (EV) development, Singapore tech start-up Voltality has partnered with Thai industrial estate conglomerate WHA Group last year to offer a multilateral roaming platform for EVs in Thailand. Currently, Voltality provides access to over 2,000 EV charging points.</p><p>15.Secondly, accelerating digital collaboration. Singapore and Thailand are digital frontrunners in ASEAN, and our countries would benefit significantly by enhancing digital collaboration.</p><p>a. For example, our Paynow-PromptPay real-time payment linkage launched since 2021 have allowed users to transfer funds securely and seamlessly between accounts in Singapore and Thailand. This is a practical demonstration of how technology can bring about tangible benefits to our people and to our businesses.</p><p>b. As digital trade between both our countries continue to grow, Singapore and Thai businesses will have much to gain by leveraging cross-border e-commerce for better connectivity and better market access.</p><p>16.Third, pioneering sustainability collaboration. Carbon markets would allow us to unlock new economic opportunities across our entire region whilst mitigating carbon emissions.</p><p>a. Thailand is a forerunner in this space. Since 2024, Thailand has developed and implemented its own national carbon standard, the Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction (TVER) programme. It is the first country to complete an Article 6.2 carbon credits transfer under its cooperation with Switzerland.</p><p>b. I am about to announce with great pleasure that this afternoon, I will be signing an Implementation Agreement pursuant to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement with Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Chalermchai Sri-on. I am really looking forward to this Agreement because this Agreement will be the first between two ASEAN member states, and this is a significant milestone in our bilateral climate cooperation.</p><p>c. This Agreement will unlock additional climate finance and catalyse and uplift investments into credible carbon projects in Thailand, such as in forestry and e-mobility. It will also support Singapore in meeting our climate targets.</p><p>d. I am confident that our collaborations on this front will serve as a pathfinder for the region, by demonstrating how countries can work together to achieve both economic and environmental good outcomes.</p><p>e. We look forward to working closely with Thailand to implement the Agreement. I would like to encourage our business communities to look and explore joint projects that can advance sustainable development, that can contribute to a dynamic carbon market in ASEAN. This will bring significant meaningful impact to all of our communities.</p><p>Closing</p><p>17.Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude with this thought: in this era of uncertainty, collaboration and partnerships have never been more vital.</p><p>18.It is through all of us working together, Singapore and Thailand, alongside with the rest of ASEAN, we can prevail by turning challenges into opportunities. We can build a more integrated and a more resilient and sustainable regional economy enabled by digital and green transformation, and we continue to be able to define and shape our collective future.</p><p>Thank you.

ST EngineeringThe technology, engineering and defence company had a strong run for the first half of this year, with a YTD return of 72.3 per cent, as the group recorded a surge of contract wins worth nearly S$4.4 billion in Q1. This brought ST Engineering's order book to S$29.8 billion as at Mar 31. Some S$7.3 billion of these contracts are expected to be delivered this year.</p><p> The group's commercial aerospace segment reportedly accounted for about S$1.3 billion of the new jobs, defence and public security S$2.7 billion, and the rest came from the urban solutions and satcom segment. </p><p> Despite the ongoing tariff war, ST Engineering said on May 9 that it sees \"immaterial financial impact\" for the group, but continues to monitor the \"evolving situation\".</p><p> On Jun 25, the company announced that it will be divesting its entire equity interest in ST Engineering LeeBoy, a US-based construction equipment manufacturer, for an estimated US$290 million. It also issued US$750million of 4.25 per cent notes due 2030 via its subsidiary, ST Engineering RHQ, to bolster its capital structure and support future investments. </p><p> 2. Hongkong Land The property developer has made a comeback in the first half of 2025 with a YTD return of 49.2 per cent, after announcing that it would sell 147,025 square feet (sq ft) of One Exchange Square to Hong Kong's stock exchange operator for HK$6.3 billion (S$1.1 billion). This is in addition to the group's plans to launch a share buyback programme. </p><p> Earlier on Mar 7, the company posted a 44 per cent lower underlying profit of US$410 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2024, from US$734 million a year prior. </p><p> The group, which is part of the Jardine-Matheson stable, has said that it is pivoting its business to focus on ultra-premium, mixed-use commercial properties in Asia's \"gateway\" cities. </p><p> 3. Sembcorp Industries The energy and urban development company, part of the Temasek group, came in as the third top-performing stock on the SGX, with a 33.6 per cent YTD return. </p><p> The group has been developing various partnerships in the Asia region, as two commercial agreements involving Sembcorp Industries were inked during the 15th Singapore-Indonesia Six Bilateral Economic Working Groups Ministerial Meeting on Jun 15.</p><p> Additionally, on Jun 12, the group's wholly owned renewables subsidiary Sembcorp Green Infra was awarded a 50 megawatt round-the-clock power project from Indian public-sector company Solar Energy Corporation of India. </p><p> The subsidiary was also awarded a solar-energy storage hybrid project by SJVN, an Indian state-owned power company on May 29.</p><p> 4. DFI Retail GroupThe pan-Asian retailer recorded a YTD return of 31.7 per cent, amid various divestments by the company in recent times. </p><p> The company sold Chinese supermarket operator Yonghui Superstores to low-cost retailer Miniso in late 2024, leading to an 18 per cent decline in underlying profit for Q1 2025 compared with the same period a year ago. The Shanghai-listed player contributed US$23 million in earnings in the corresponding period a year ago.</p><p> The group also divested its 22.2 per cent stake in Robinsons Retail for an undisclosed sum on May 30. </p><p> Since then, however, analysts from DBS have a \"buy\" rating on DFI Retail, and raised its target price from US$3 to US$3.60 on Jun 9, in light of \"a stronger and more focused business strategy\". </p><p> 5. UOL GroupThe real estate player recorded a YTD return of 31.2 per cent, as it secured more tender wins and launched more developments in its joint venture projects. </p><p> Its indirect subsidiary Qin Rui Jia (Shanghai) Realty Co had teamed up with China Jinmao Holdings Group on a 10:90 basis for the government land sales tender, which closed on Feb 27. </p><p> Additionally, the group's joint Tampines project with Singapore Land and CapitaLand Development -- Parktown Residence -- began previews on Feb 7, with prices starting in the S$2,100 to S$2,300 per sq ft range. </p><p> This comes after UOL's 60 per cent net profit decline to S$227.8 million for the six months ended Dec 31, 2024, though it saw growth across its key segments that drove a 16 per cent rise in revenue to S$1.5 billion for the period.</p><p> 6. Jardine MathesonThe Hong Kong-based conglomerate is in sixth place with a 26.9 per cent YTD return. </p><p> This is good news for the group, which announced on Mar 10 that it logged an 11.4 per cent decrease in underlying profit to US$1.5 billion for its full year ended Dec 31, 2024, from US$1.7 billion in the previous corresponding period.</p><p> The group attributed the fall in profit to significantly lower contribution from Hong Kong-listed automotive dealership group Zhongsheng. </p><p> The other drag on profit was due to reduced profit from Hongkong Land, attributed to non-cash impairments it incurred from its build-to-sell segment on the Chinese mainland.</p><p> 7. SingtelThe local telecommunications giant had a 25.3 per cent return YTD, after returning to the black with a net profit of S$2.8 billion for its second half ended March, compared with a net loss of S$1.3 billion for the previous corresponding period. </p><p> Singtel also authorised its first share buyback programme of up to S$2 billion on May 22. The programme, which will be delivered over the course of three years until financial year 2028, involves the purchase of shares in the open market that will subsequently be cancelled. </p><p> It also incorporated its wholly owned subsidiaries in Singapore, such as Singtel International Digital Services (IDS) and IDS Cloud, during this period. </p><p> 8. Singapore Exchange (SGX) In eighth position, SGX itself recorded a 20.7 per cent YTD return, after seeing various listings on the bourse in H1. </p><p>Japanese telco Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) filed to list a real estate investment trust (Reit) on Jun 27 -- possibly the largest S-Reit listing in 10 years. </p><p> Meanwhile, software services provider Info-Tech Systems closed at S$0.35, about 16.6 per cent above its initial public offering (IPO) price of S$0.30 on its first trading day on Jul 4. Automotive group Vin's Holdings also made its listing debut on Apr 15 on SGX this year, as the first IPO on the bourse in 2025. </p><p> 9. CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT)The largest Reit listed on the Singapore bourse had a 16.4 per cent return YTD. </p><p> This comes after the manager of the trust on May 2 decided to sell its stake in the serviced residence component of CapitaSpring worth S$126 million, with the transaction concluded on May 30. </p><p> A week earlier, on Apr 25, CICT posted a 0.8 per cent dip in net property income of S$291.5 million for its first quarter of FY2025 from the same year-ago period.

That it surpassed its target reflects the appetite not only for infrastructure as a private-market asset class, but also for exposure to the Asia-Pacific, where the funding gap is wide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Globally, countries in the Asia-Pacific are among those most vulnerable to the climate crisis. The Asian Development Bank has estimated that Asia will need US$1.7 trillion in annual investment in infrastructure through 2030 to meet current demand.</p><p> For its portfolio exposures, Seraya has picked two themes that play into megatrends -- green data centres and facilities that support the energy transition challenge. It succeeded in attracting a roster of blue-chip investors, including the Alberta Investment Management Company, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and BlackRock funds.</p><p> Seraya's Fund 1 aims to invest in mid-market deals. Its proposition combines the income-generating profile of infrastructure assets with a returns kicker that is in line with private equity assets. </p><p> To date, more than half of the capital has been deployed. A second round of capital-raising is planned for 2025.</p><p> Seraya managing partner James Chern says the firm was founded with a vision for a \"truly local, Asia-focused fund management company in the infrastructure sector\".</p><p> \"Drawing on our experience with large global and regional funds, our firm is dedicated to investing in Asia, championing local teams, and developing innovative investment opportunities within our region.\"</p><p> Chern was previously a founding member of I Squared Capital, a global infrastructure fund manager with US$40 billion in assets. Managing partner and sibling Ivan Chern was former managing director of RRJ Capital, a US$12 billion private equity fund.</p><p> Managing director Khan Yow says the firm's stamping ground is the mid-market space, where the deal flow is \"rich\" and deal values range between US$50 million and US$100 million. \"We are builders of companies. In the infrastructure segment, we're relatively small compared to our global peers. Large firms are under pressure to deploy very big-ticket sizes, but in Asia we don't believe there are all these big-ticket sized deals out there for unlisted infrastructure.\"</p><p> Seraya Partners began to seed investments soon after its founding in 2020. This meant the fund could begin to generate revenues almost from the get-go, thanks to long-term lease contracts.</p><p> Yow said: \"We have a compelling story and thesis. But the ultimate factor which probably is the tipping point, is that we have real, actionable deals that our investors see, that they can underwrite. They know that when the rubber hits the road, there is something to put money against.</p><p> \"At the asset level, the deal has to be profitable from day-minus-one, where even before we put in the capital, we have a clear path to revenues... We have to plan carefully so that our deal pipeline supports the growth of the portfolio companies. It's not just about assets, but about the assets being operated by a competent, strong team that can grow them.\"</p><p> The first investment was in Empyrion Digital, which started when Seraya acquired a data centre from a family business in 2021. Empyrion is positioned as \"green by design\", which means it focuses on energy and water efficiency through the adoption of new technologies. </p><p> The efficiency components are designed upfront and integrated into the construction and operations. </p><p> Empyrion's first centre, SG Dodid1, is in Serangoon North. The firm has since expanded into South Korea, where it is building a 40 megawatt centre in Gangnam, Seoul, that is expected to be completed in 2025. It is also exploring facilities in Japan and Taiwan.</p><p> A second key investment is Cyan Renewables, which owns and leases specialised vessels to support all phases of offshore wind farm projects, from installation to operations. It acquired its first ship in 2023 in a deal with Belgium's DEME, and secured a long-term charter with turbine maker Siemens Gamesa for work in offshore Belgium.</p><p> \"Cyan's vessels are the shovels and spades, and core to the operation of wind farms, where there is a huge shortage of vessels. The wind farm operators don't want to have the capex of US$50 million to US$100 million on their books. We provide the solution on a lease basis,\" says Yow. \"We're probably the first in Asia, and we believe one of the biggest in Asia for such an idea.\" </p><p> Cyan aims to own and operate a US$1 billion portfolio of vessels by the end of 2025.</p><p> A third area is Astrid Renew, which will focus on renewable energy and energy storage solutions. </p><p> Yow says Seraya aims to achieve a stable \"bond-like\" return profile, but with \"enough juice for upside with growth opportunities\". It aims to focus on developed Asia, in countries where respect for rule of law reduces country-specific risks.</p><p> \"Infrastructure as an asset class is well-established with big, limited partners, who primarily invest for yield because they want stable cash flows. But if you just go for yield, returns are not very interesting. You're just clipping a coupon.</p><p> \"We try to achieve a blend. We get decent yield for investors, but to have the extra juice, we also offer value creation. We've started as early as possible to build our companies. In the underlying assets, we stick to the principles of infrastructure investments -- which consist of long-term contracts, stable and strong counterparties, predictable revenues and good equipment.</p><p> \"But we also have people and talent which can build the companies to a larger scale and create future opportunities for exit. We take an outsized share of our portfolio companies, which enables us to guide, build and grow the companies. We think that's how we can command interest among investors who want to put money with us.\"</p><p> Seraya Partners itself has close to 20 employees.

The survey, which polled 300 corporate real estate (CRE) leaders overseeing over 650 million sq ft of space globally, revealed that over 50% of respondents plan to grow their office workspace over the next three to five years, the equivalent of 104 million sq ft.</p><p>Plans to expand come as companies seek to build resilience in a landscape being shaped by economic, geopolitical and technological disruptions. In Knight Frank's survey, respondents identified the need to balance growth and innovation with cost control as the biggest influence over their real estate strategy over the next three to five years.</p><p>The second-biggest influence identified by CRE leaders was uncertainty and volatility in the operating environment. Trade wars and political tension also ranked highly among respondents, coming in at fourth place.</p><p>Despite these concerns, rather than cutting workspace or freezing decision-making, many companies are choosing to expand, says Knight Frank. Of the survey respondents that plan to grow their office footprint, 27 companies are expected to boost their workspace by over 20%.</p><p>At the same time, corporations are embracing change by pivoting to real estate strategies that build in optionality and flexibility, including shorter leases, more flexible formats, and diversified locations.</p><p>\"Corporates are committing to new space but building in flexible lease terms and options on pre-lets to remain nimble,\" says Tim Armstrong, partner and global head of occupier strategy and solutions at Knight Frank. He adds that companies are looking to regionalise their footprint to stay relevant to local markets while also diversifying exposure to geopolitical risks.</p><p>Lee Elliott, partner and head of global occupier research at Knight Frank, notes that as occupiers regionalise portfolios, many are moving away from monolithic headquarters towards having networks of hubs in prime office assets. \"The trend is already playing out in major markets where demand is tilting toward buildings that offer adaptability, experience, and ESG credentials, particularly in cities that combine global reach with local talent,\" he adds.</p><p>Workstyle evolution was cited as the third most influential factor for real estate strategy among respondents over the next three to five years. However, in contrast to the high-profile full return-to-office mandates that have made headlines in the last year, Knight Frank's survey found that only 10% of respondents expected to opt for an \"office only\" workstyle in the next three years. The majority, at 46%, expected to follow a hybrid workstyle, while 22% elected for an \"office first\" approach.</p><p>As hybrid work settles into the mainstream, leaders are redesigning offices for better workplace utilisation by focusing on supporting outcomes rather than presence, says Knight Frank. This, in turn, is leading to demand for workspaces that can flex across work styles while activating spaces in ways that drive engagement, support culture and deliver measurable productivity gains.</p><p>\"Corporate real estate is expected to deliver more than ever, and leaders face increasingly urgent challenges that can no longer be parked in the sidings,\" says Elliott, adding that while many see hybrid working and office-centric models as the future of the workplace, corporations will increasingly focus on the functionality of the environment and whether it delivers for employees and teams.</p><p>Frasers launches two new serviced apartment properties in Mainland China</p><p>Frasers Hospitality has added two new properties under its Modena by Fraser brand in Mainland China - Modena by Fraser Shenzhen and Modena by Fraser Wujiaochang Shanghai.</p><p>Both properties offer serviced apartment units equipped with kitchenettes, communal areas and flexible common spaces that can be tailored to accommodate guests' individual needs.</p><p>The 325-unit Modena by Frasers Shenzhen soft opened on March 29.

By 2035, individuals aged 60 and above are set to rise above 400 million, or 30 per cent of the total population.</p><p> Neither does China's ageing bode well for the country's ongoing property struggles. While structural deleveraging of China's property sector has become a policy priority for Beijing in the last five years, DBS expects that the country's housing oversupply will continue to be exacerbated as household sizes, marriage rates and home-buying populations shrink. </p><p> China's demographic struggles have not been ignored by policymakers. The country has begun progressively raising its retirement age -- which currently ranks among the lowest globally -- and recently announced its intention to use local government bond proceeds to convert unsold homes into affordable housing.</p><p> All in on AIA broader move towards technology-driven productivity gains has been targeted by policymakers, as both a driver of productivity and to offset the country's ageing woes. </p><p> The report noted that the country's State Council has set 2025 as a major milestone for AI development, with a goal of becoming the global leader by 2030. State-backed venture capital funds have pumped more than 23 per cent of their total investments into more than a million AI firms nationwide in the past decade, the report said.</p><p> The emergence of DeepSeek, the DBS team said, is optimising chip performance, and lowering the energy and computational costs of AI model training and inference. The report further projected the country to dominate the global chip market by 2040, with its market share likely to rise beyond 50 per cent.</p><p> Such advancements in AI infrastructure are expected to enhance productivity significantly, the DBS economists added.</p><p> Humanoid robotics are intended to inject productivity gains across various sectors, especially healthcare, education, logistics and elderly care, with the adoption of robots projected to reach 50 per cent by 2040, the report said. </p><p> \"The government sees humanoid robotics as a critical solution to the ageing population crisis,\" noted Samuel Tse, senior economist at DBS. </p><p> Even agriculture is projected to undergo transformation, with the country targeting full automation in the sector by 2040 -- early glimpses already seen in projects such as automated strawberry pickers in Shandong and soil-optimising drones. </p><p> Yet as the country's middle class continues to grow, Beijing has recognised the need to transition from capital to domestic consumption as the key driver of the economy. </p><p> Currently, high household savings of about 45 per cent of GDP -- partly in response to insufficient social safety nets -- have resulted in weak domestic consumption, which accounts for just 38 per cent of GDP, the report found.</p><p> Rethinking urbanisation\"The government will roll out more and more policies to give people more confidence to spend. That means building a stronger social security system, so people don't feel like they need to hold on to every yuan just in case something goes wrong,\" said Nathan Chow, senior economist at DBS. </p><p> He projected that domestic consumption could rise to about 50 to 55 per cent by 2040.</p><p> Crucial to the target of sustainable domestic consumption is rethinking urbanisation, which has served as a key driver of Chinese economic growth over several decades through foreign investment and industrialisation, Chow added.</p><p> \"To China, urbanisation is no longer about expanding as fast as possible -- it's about growing smarter,\" he noted. \"China wants to build cities that are not only bigger but better.

Some also expect Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is also the finance minister, to speak about infrastructure for adapting to climate change in the Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18). The cost and talent requirements for sustainability reporting are key concerns for companies. All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025. Large non-listed companies will also have to do so from FY2027. These disclosures include a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct, or Scope 1, emissions as well as their Scope 2 emissions, which arise indirectly from energy purchase and usage.Last year, Singapore unveiled the Sustainability Reporting Grant (SRG) to assist large companies with annual revenues of S$100 million and above. It will cover up to 30 per cent of qualifying costs for the preparation of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sustainability report, capped at S$150,000 per company.Mike Lim, a partner at venture capital firm Trirec, suggested that the SRG could be expanded to cover the cost of sustainability initiatives that are part of the reporting process, while also incorporating incentives for early adopters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting ahead of the mandatory timeline could receive additional incentives, such as tax breaks or higher grant amounts,\u00e2\u20ac said Lim, whose firm invests in clean energy and climate tech companies. </p><p>Kelvin Lim, managing director of property player LHN Group, said that more support is needed for the technical aspects of emissions reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the challenges we faced was gathering, compiling and computing the data required to translate into emissions data. More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\u00e2\u20ac he said. He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\u00e2\u20ac Chia said. The reporting of Scope 3 emissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which arise from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upstream and downstream value chains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date. We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\u00e2\u20ac said Ng. Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate. Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). From 2024, companies subject to Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.Carbon markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\u00e2\u20ac, said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\u00e2\u20ac he said. To spur the supply of carbon credits, start-up incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit. EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.While no announcements are expected on Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\u00e2\u20ac said Dr Rao.Targeted help for SMEsSeveral market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. While Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\u00e2\u20ac, said Helge Muenkel, DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief sustainability officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\u00e2\u20ac he said. Eric Lian, UOB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\u00e2\u20ac To accelerate SMEs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. Climate adaptationSome industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation. Said LHN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lim: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As climate risks intensify, we expect climate resilience and adaptation measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as enhanced drainage infrastructure, coastal protection and flood management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be key priorities in Budget 2025.\u00e2\u20acEY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tekchandani similarly expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong emphasis on climate adaptation strategies, in light of increasing climate-related risks such as flash floods and heat waves\u00e2\u20ac. This could include funding for infrastructure projects that enhance climate resilience. Budget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\u00e2\u20ac he said. DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Muenkel expects Budget 2025 to continue Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pragmatic and long-term approach, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balancing economic competitiveness with sustainable development\u00e2\u20ac.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit.

The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.</p><p> Carbon markets \"need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\", said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. </p><p> \"While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\" he said. </p><p> To spur the supply of carbon credits, startup incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. </p><p> On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit.</p><p> EY's Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore's attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.</p><p> While no announcements are expected on Singapore's carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative.</p><p> \"This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\" said Dr Rao.</p><p> Several market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. </p><p> While Singapore's carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \"there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\", said Helge Muenkel, DBS' chief sustainability officer.</p><p> \"Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions, will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\" he said.</p><p> Eric Lian, UOB's head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \"SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\"</p><p> To accelerate SMEs' sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. </p><p> The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. </p><p> Some industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation. Said LHN's Lim: \"As climate risks intensify, we expect climate resilience and adaptation measures -- such as enhanced drainage infrastructure, coastal protection and flood management -- to be key priorities in Budget 2025.\"</p><p> EY's Tekchandani similarly expects a \"strong emphasis on climate adaptation strategies, in light of increasing climate-related risks such as flash floods and heat waves\". This could include funding for infrastructure projects that enhance climate resilience.</p><p> Challenging timeBudget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. </p><p> But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh.</p><p> \"Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\" he said. </p><p> DBS' Muenkel expects Budget 2025 to continue Singapore's pragmatic and long-term approach, \"balancing economic competitiveness with sustainable development\". </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit.

This was 30 per cent higher than the year before, making it the most expensive year on record for natural disasters. As devastating wildfires burn in Los Angeles, 2025 could prove to be even dearer.Climate change has intensified the dangers of wildfires, meaning disaster events are more likely to occur outside of the typical wildfire season. With global temperatures exceeding an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2024, this is only going to become more difficult to mitigate and adapt to.Economic burden for AmericansJPMorgan estimates that the economic cost of the LA wildfires will total around US$50 billion. </p><p>However, only US$20 billion of this will be insured, so there is a significant protection gap. In recent years, as wildfires become bigger and harder to control, many insurers have decided against offering protection in high-risk areas, which has exacerbated the economic burden for many Americans.US President Donald Trump has been vocal about his scepticism of the threat climate change poses, labelling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hoax\u00e2\u20ac and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the great scams of all time\u00e2\u20ac during his campaign in 2024. In his first term, he withdrew the US from the 2015 Paris agreement in a major setback to efforts to curb the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emissions. He has vowed in his second term to repeal environmental rules introduced by the Joe Biden administration, end public spending on clean energy, scrap incentives for Americans to buy electric vehicles and embark on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drill, baby, drill\u00e2\u20ac drive for new fossil fuel energy. On his first day in office this week, Trump once again withdrew the US from the Paris agreement and halted more than US$300 billion in green infrastructure funding as part of his plan to undo the progress made by Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team.This will have drastic implications for transition finance. A move towards greater de-regulation will override much of the Biden administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important work to hold industries to account for their emissions and counter the risk of greenwashing through disclosure requirements. There has already been a widespread retreat of banks and asset managers from many of the frameworks and alliances that were established following COP26 in 2021. Since the Nov 5 US election, all six of the largest US banks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. BlackRock, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest asset manager, has left Net Zero Asset Managers, the equivalent organisation for money managers. And just a few days after Trump took office, the Federal Reserve left the Network for Greening the Financial System in a blow to central bank net-zero efforts.In OMFIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Public Funds 2024, not a single survey respondent chose climate change when asked to identify the top three economic factors affecting their investment approach over the next five to 10 years. In 2023, it was chosen by 50 per cent of respondents. The latest findings show a clear shift in public pension and sovereign funds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns over the medium term.It is disappointing, but not surprising, that the political climate of the US is able to exert such influence over a crucial part of the fight to meet net zero. Just four years after these banks and asset managers declared \u00e2\u20ac\u0153climate risk is investment risk\u00e2\u20ac, these alliances are beginning to crumble and pledges are being sidelined.US will fall behindDespite the progress made by the Biden administration in attempting to regulate and standardise frameworks and disclosure requirements, the US still trailed Europe in action on climate change. A report by OMFIF and Luxembourg for Finance in 2022 found that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the US still looks to Europe for guidance on ESG regulation and lags in green equity development\u00e2\u20ac. With transition finance set to be bumped down the list of priorities, it stands to reason that the gap between the two jurisdictions will soon become a gulf.Elsewhere, China is looking to assume a leading role in the clean energy transition, hoping to dominate the market in the next phase of green innovation. It is already the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest producer of solar energy and it has set its sights on the EV industry. Trump spoke this week of his plans to impose 10 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports on Feb 1, in addition to the 100 per cent tariff that already exists on Chinese-made EVs. Given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hostility towards both climate change and China, it may be safe to assume that Chinese green technology won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be making its way into the US any time soon.However, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance in this field, and the business it will do with the rest of the world, may make some US business leaders rethink a reluctance to engage with the transition. Could a healthy dose of competition be enough to pull the US back into the net-zero game? Regardless of the cause of the wildfires, Trump will be unable to ignore the economic devastation wrought across LA. In a fraught political environment, Democrats and Republicans will have to reach across the divide to help those who have lost everything. Even more importantly, they will have to work together to prevent a catastrophe on this scale from happening again.

Introduction</p><p>1. A very good afternoon to everyone. I am delighted to join you and open today's Sustainability Apex Programme (SAP) event, a unique gathering of legal and accounting professionals committed to navigating one of the defining challenges of our time - sustainability.</p><p>B.Evolving Global Sustainability Landscape</p><p>2. The world is at a critical juncture in the sustainability transition.</p><p>a. Climate risks, regulatory shifts and market expectations are driving unprecedented change.</p><p>b. Businesses are no longer asking whether sustainability matters, but rather, how they can adapt, innovate, and integrate sustainable practices to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving global economy.</p><p>3. However, shifting political tides hint at potential headwinds to global climate action.</p><p>a. The US has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and is increasing oil and gas production.</p><p>b. More recently, with political tides in Europe turning to the right, the European Commission has proposed an \"Omnibus\" package to streamline ESG reporting rules, leaving investors concerned about weakened accountability for businesses.</p><p>4.Given these developments, it is understandable for businesses to be concerned about what these developments mean for you. Will there still be demand for sustainability-related professional services? Is this the right time to invest resources and strengthen capabilities? These are questions I'm sure you are asking yourselves.</p><p>5. The reality of climate change transcends political discourse. The science and data are clear - climate change is not a distant threat but a present reality. Singapore's response must be grounded in this scientific truth. As a small country, we cannot afford the luxury of not being ready for climate change. We have no high hills in which to retreat, we have no hinterlands in which to expand. Singapore is a small island faced with rising sea levels. For us, this is an existential issue. So, we have no choice but to deal with these issues squarely. Singapore needs to be ready, regardless of trends elsewhere; we have to take decisive and proactive actions to seize the opportunities.</p><p>6.Aside from politics, there are two other important drivers of climate action.</p><p>a.First, economics. Scaling up key green technologies has made the cost of renewable energy more affordable. The average levelised cost of solar energy globally, for instance, is now 50% lower than that of fossil fuels. This explains why two-third of global energy investment in 2024 went to clean energy technologies and infrastructure. Green growth opportunities remain, and continue to be driven by market forces.</p><p>b. Second and more importantly, nature. Nature is not going to wait for us. As climate change accelerates, the devastation wrought on people and on infrastructure will intensify; the last 10 years alone have been the hottest years on record. The public will demand that governments and companies take urgent action. Nature will force the world to take decisive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>7. Against this backdrop, organisations must prepare for the long term and be ready to reap the green economic opportunities that have and will continue to arise. Those which lag behind will be forced to act eventually and will experience a more disruptive transition. So, the essence is to change before you are made to change.</p><p>C. Growth Opportunities in Sustainability</p><p>8. Professional services firms here play an important role in strengthening the sustainability ecosystem.</p><p>9.As companies across industries face growing regulatory requirements, investor scrutiny, and customer demand for responsible business practices, they are turning to professional services for guidance to navigate this transition. In short, they will be running to many people in this room.</p><p>a. Today, organisations increasingly turn to consultants to help develop and implement sustainability strategies, integrate sustainability into corporate decision-making, and identify opportunities for innovation amidst the sustainability push.</p><p>b.Lawyers are increasingly called upon to navigate the complexities of sustainability regulations, manage climate-related litigation and compliance risks, and advise on green financing disclosures.</p><p>c.Accountants are stepping up as gatekeepers of financial integrity, ensuring companies accurately measure, report, and verify sustainability data in ways that are robust and auditable.</p><p>10.I encourage professional services firms to proactively adapt to such needs - by expanding your service offerings, integrating emerging technologies and develop specialised expertise.</p><p>a. This allows your firms to unlock new market opportunities arising from sustainability, build client trust at an early stage, and lead the transition to a green economy.</p><p>D. Singapore as a sustainability hub</p><p>11.Singapore is the ideal hub for professional services firm looking to seize new opportunities in sustainability. Let me share three key factors.</p><p>12. First, the Singapore Government is committed to sustainability.</p><p>13. Singapore has made clear our stance on climate action and continues to drive initiatives to support the green transition.</p><p>a. Through the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we have laid out a comprehensive roadmap, outlining key targets to advance sustainable development, green infrastructure, and carbon reduction efforts. Businesses are able to tap into a structured framework that supports their sustainability ambitions.</p><p>b. We have also introduced the first carbon pricing scheme in Southeast Asia, with carbon tax increasing from S$5 per tonne in 2019 to between S$50 and S$80 by 2030, creating stronger incentives for decarbonisation.</p><p>c. In addition, the government has also rolled out a suite of sustainable finance initiatives to encourage responsible investment and accelerate green financing. Singapore is a trusted financial centre and is also ASEAN's largest sustainable debt market. Sustainable debt issuances grew year-on-year by 7% in 2023, to about S$38 billion. Over S$130 billion of sustainable bonds and loans were issued between 2018 and 2023.</p><p>d.To spur green and transition activities and mitigate the risks of greenwashing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy, or SAT in short, in end 2023. Companies and financial institutions can use the SAT in various ways such as developing sustainability frameworks or structuring green and transition financing solutions that are aligned with or refer to the SAT criteria.</p><p>e.In particular, the three local banks have either completed or are in the process of updating their sustainable financing frameworks to integrate the SAT, and will be using the SAT as a key reference tool in the structuring of green or transition financing solutions going forward.</p><p>f.Singapore's professional services sector plays a vital role in advancing the sustainable finance agenda and is well-placed to participate in these opportunities. Let me give you an example:</p><p>i. Sembcorp's updated Green Financing Framework 2024, draws reference from the SAT in defining what is \"green\" for its energy projects. To ensure credibility of the framework, Sembcorp has engaged a professional services firm for its pre-issuance external assurance. Moving forward, Sembcorp also intends to engage external review providers for its post-issuance reviews.</p><p>g.MAS has recently published an Information Note that showcases practical applications of the SAT by corporates and financial institutions. I encourage the sector to take a look at the SAT, and contribute your specialised expertise and knowledge in the area of sustainable finance because your clients will need your advice.</p><p>14. Second, there is growing demand for sustainability solutions in Singapore.</p><p>15. As a global business hub, Singapore is home to a wide range of regional headquarters, financial institutions and multinational corporations. Many of these companies are embedding sustainability at the core of their strategies - driven either by their corporate commitment to sustainability, or due to sustainability regulations. Corporate demand for sustainability reporting and advisory, carbon accounting and other carbon services will only increase.</p><p>16. Beyond that, Singapore's green economy is also growing.</p><p>a. Singapore is emerging as Asia's green finance hub, with sustainable investment flows increasing across multiple sectors.</p><p>b. Singapore is also investing heavily in green technology, sustainable urban development and clean energy - all of these will unlock new service opportunities for professional services firms.</p><p>17. Third, Singapore has a high concentration of sustainability players here.</p><p>18. We host an increasing number of global sustainability leaders - from large corporates, to major renewable energy firms and carbon market players; ESG-focused investment funds, private equity firms and banks; and a comprehensive range of sustainability solutions providers, such as yourself.</p><p>19. With a robust network of sustainability players concentrated in Singapore, professional services firms have the opportunity to leverage partnerships, deepen expertise, and expand your sustainability service offerings.</p><p>E. Seizing Opportunities in Sustainability</p><p>20.Collaboration is key to capturing the opportunities from sustainability.</p><p>a. The sustainability challenge is complex, spanning multiple industries and disciplines. No single firm can address these issues alone.</p><p>21.The Singapore Government is committed to supporting professional services firms harness new opportunities arising from sustainability.</p><p>a. We recognise that professional services firms play a crucial role in shaping sustainable business practices, and are actively creating platforms to facilitate engagement, knowledge-sharing and capacity building.</p><p>b. Initiatives such as the Sustainability Apex Programme (SAP), spearheaded by ISCA (Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants) and LawSoc (Law Society of Singapore) and enabled by Enterprise Singapore, were designed precisely to provide a space for firms to come together, exchange insights, and explore collaboration opportunities. This builds on the earlier Committee of Future Economy's work, where we identified that greater collaboration among professional services firms such as accounting and legal will benefit from the synergies, and in time to come, we will see how we can add on other types of professional services, but this is a good start.</p><p>c. The Ministry of Law, Singapore Economic Development Board and Enterprise Singapore have also commissioned PwC Singapore to conduct a study to map out sustainability opportunities for the legal services sector - PwC will be sharing key findings from this study later.</p><p>d. These initiatives underscore our commitment to ensuring that professional services firms have the necessary resources, networks, and policy support to succeed in the green economy.</p><p>F. Conclusion</p><p>22.In closing, sustainability is not just an imperative - it is an opportunity for the professional services sector to develop new capabilities and work together to create new growth engines.</p><p>23. I would like to thank all of you for taking time off your busy schedules to join us for this event as well as PwC for supporting us throughout this journey. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to the panellists, whom you will hear from later, for sharing their valuable insights.</p><p>24. I wish all of you a fruitful event and I hope you gain new insights and connections today to seize opportunities in sustainability. Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Business Expansion, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Law,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Singapore has made clear our stance on climate action and continues to drive initiatives to support the green transition. a.

Its participation reinforces the firm's commitment to addressing climate-related issues through data-driven investment decisions.</p><p> As an investment manager with offices in more than 30 countries globally and approximately 1,300 investment professionals, Franklin Templeton recognises the powerful influence it can have in this area by coordinating its efforts within a global strategic framework.</p><p> Internally, the company is also incorporating sustainability into its DNA.</p><p> In March 2021, Franklin Templeton established a firm-wide Stewardship and Sustainability Council, comprising key investment leaders from each of its specialist investment managers, to leverage the wealth of expertise across its autonomous investment teams.</p><p> In addition to the dedicated experts within its specialist investment managers, Franklin Templeton's Global Sustainability\u00a0Strategy Team engages\u00a0its investment teams and risk management professionals to help\u00a0them recognise and understand the impact and scope of material ESG\u00a0issues. On top of this, they consult on sustainable investment topics in their analysis, and use research and tools to ensure that ESG issues are addressed throughout the company's investment\u00a0processes.</p><p> In February this year, Franklin Templeton appointed its first global head of sustainability.

Subsequent spending on infrastructure upgrades and new infrastructure builds will also expand these asset bases and, in turn, boost earnings, cash flows and dividends."]}, {"relevance_score": 106, "title": "Briefs", "published": "2024-11-18", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">COP29 begins with 'breakthrough' on carbon market rules</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The annual climate conference of the United Nations (UN) started on Nov 11 with a \"breakthrough\", according to host nation Azerbaijan, as parties agreed on rules for a UN-administered global carbon market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The COP29 Presidency says parties have \"achieved a critical early success\" by welcoming standards adopted by the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body for the creation of carbon credits under Article 6.4.

And there, you go back again to a different structure -- which could be a public-private partnership or another structure -- how you can mobilise money for the region where it is actually most needed,\" said Speth. </p><p> Bigger expectationsWhile investors typically get more leverage for every dollar of investment in emerging markets, the higher returns they are getting now from the EU and the US has led them to have bigger expectations on the premium they can get from emerging markets -- given that these markets are perceived to have higher risks. </p><p> Blended finance is a capital-raising approach that leans on investors with higher risk appetites, such as development funds and philanthropists or governments, to provide concessional or catalytic capital to pull in more commercial investors. </p><p> The main thrust of blended finance is for concessional or catalytic capital to lower investment risks or the costs of capital through guarantees or first loss, thereby attracting more commercial capital. </p><p> Discussions on using this financing mechanism to fund the energy transition in South-east Asia have been gaining traction. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has launched a blended finance initiative known as Financing Asia's Transition Partnership last year, with the goal of raising US$5 billion.</p><p> However, Speth cited several challenges inhibiting the scaling up of blended finance in South-east Asia. \"The thing about blended finance is a lot of people need to come together, and all of them have different interests, so you need to have a really good project manager who's aligning all these things, because we can only do this as a team.\"</p><p> \"And then it takes time to create these (blended finance) vehicles. It's a risk-adjusted return. So if you have different parties in that vehicle, some are willing to take either fixed returns or lower returns... But you need to find that party first to be able to blend this with institutional capital,\" she added. </p><p> Investors are also looking for a stable regulatory environment to deploy their funds. Asset managers like BlackRock will not make their investment decisions by taking a risk on regulation, said Speth. </p><p> A liberalised energy market, such as the Philippines', is the most efficient and cheap in the long term. </p><p> However, Speth also recognised that governments in South-east Asia are unable to transform their energy markets overnight as energy prices need to be kept at a level where its affordable for consumers. </p><p> \"I think it's finding the right balance, and probably we will take some time until you can do that entire shift... All these markets, they have cycles, and they are going to be a 20 or 30-year journey. It's not going to be one, or two years where energy transition will be our main focus,\" she added. </p><p> Broader macro themesBeyond just how the energy market is regulated, Brad Kim, BlackRock's managing director of global infrastructure fund in Asia-Pacific, said that asset managers also look at broader macro themes as well, such as how governments in the region are aligning policies relating to artificial intelligence (AI), supply chain and energy transition. </p><p> \"(The region) is so spread out between a very large area -- lots of islands, lots of seas, lots of different countries.

He added that net inflows in Q3 2024 would have been higher than the same period a year ago if this exchange-traded fund (ETF) were excluded. </p><p> Despite the on-year decline, UOB's Wong noted that investors are not redeeming their ESG-themed funds, as they understand that these are long-term investment instruments and are prepared to hold on regardless of short-term changes in sentiment. </p><p> \"We also believe that the broader ESG trend remains intact, as both institutional and retail investors increasingly consider sustainability factors in their long-term investment strategies, and value the importance of responsible investment practices. Regulatory developments, corporate sustainability disclosures and consumer demand for responsible business practices are expected to support ESG investing in Asean over the longer term,\" he added. </p><p> Shum also added that the sustainable investments universe in South-east Asia is broader than open-ended and ETFs domiciled in the region. </p><p> \"We see capital flows into other asset classes and areas. For example, many projects or companies contributing to sustainable development in Asean are early-stage or small and medium-sized enterprises, which are attracting funding from the philanthropic and private markets -- for example, venture capital, microfinance, private equity and private debt -- as well as public funding support for infrastructure,\" she added. </p><p> While ESG funds may have seen lower amounts of net inflow in Q3 2024, the returns were much higher than last year, averaging a three-month return at 16.96 per cent -- an improvement from -3.54 per cent a year ago.</p><p> ESG funds performed better than non-ESG funds, which managed an average quarterly return of 14.74 per cent, reversing from -1.85 per cent this time last year. </p><p> Notwithstanding the re-election of former US president Donald Trump -- who is a well-known climate sceptic -- fund managers foresee continued investor interest in ESG investing, with long-term capital flows into sustainable investments for South-east Asia. </p><p> Oil and gas stocks had surged, while renewable energy stocks had slumped in the immediate aftermath of Trump's election victory earlier in November. Besides being a climate sceptic, Trump had previously said that he will expand oil and gas production, and withdraw the US -- once again -- from the Paris Agreement. </p><p> FundamentalsWhile markets may react in the short term to political events, Fidelity's Wong said that they tend to be driven by fundamentals over time and that investors focus on long-term fundamentals rather than try to predict near-term outcomes.</p><p> Despite concerns that Trump will not be supportive of policies that further the ESG agenda and may even roll back some existing policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act which provides tax incentives for clean-energy technologies, UOB's Wong said that global initiatives to address climate change remain. </p><p> This includes the adoption of rules governing the global trading of carbon markets, as well as the setting of a new climate finance quantum that developed countries are obligated to provide for developing countries at the recently concluded United Nations' COP29 climate summit. </p><p> \"We expect these developments to drive the momentum in sustainability,\" said UOB's Wong. </p><p> Beyond global developments, there continues to be persistent interest among institutional investors in South-east Asia to incorporate ESG into their investment mandates, he added.</p><p> In addition, more affordable renewable energy sources, record power demand requiring multiple sources of energy, as well as growing disclosure requirements will push businesses towards climate mitigation and adaptation, said Shum. </p><p> \"For 2025, we anticipate a growing alignment between financial returns and sustainable investment principles as ESG-related opportunities in sectors like renewable energy, technology and green infrastructure expand.

Advanced economies including the European Union, Japan and the US had accounted for the majority of completed cleantech FDI projects, but in recent years, investments have increasingly come from within the region and Asian neighbours such as China and South Korea.</p><p> However, despite its stellar increase in recent years, cleantech FDI flows remain only a small share of total FDI -- representing about 15 per cent of total FDI stock in Asean, less than 20 per cent for the EU, and slightly more than 10 per cent for China. Similarly, despite all the buzz about cleantech goods trade, exports of these goods amount to only less than 8 per cent of total goods exports for any Asean country between 2011 and 2021 -- with little rising trend.</p><p> The green sectors are still too small compared to the entire economy. To consider a true transition towards sustainability, one must also look at other sectors -- and these other sectors currently have a higher emission intensity.</p><p> On average, for Asean, every dollar of output by the entire economy amounts to almost five times the emissions of a dollar of output within the key cleantech industries alone.</p><p> Emissions-reducing technological innovation applicable to sectors outside the cleantech sector could be that missing link between driving economic growth and decarbonising the economy.</p><p> Innovation: The key to balancing the emissions-growth dilemmaUntil carbon storage technologies are widely available, emissions-mitigating technologies for production processes are particularly relevant as countries expand their carbon pricing schemes and seek to decarbonise their supply chains.</p><p> A case in point is the EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism that came into force in October last year. It effectively imposes an additional carbon price on high-emissions imports such as cement and steel from countries with more lax climate regulations.</p><p> As the global regulatory environment tightens, innovating operational and production processes might just become a daily reality for firms to comply with regulations, stay competitive and keep afloat.</p><p> Asean boasts quite a number of inventions and applications of climate change mitigation technology patents targeting production processes -- especially for the chemical industry, and increasingly also for metal processing and agriculture.

It involves shredding and processing them into a black mass that is exported, usually to China and South Korea, for further processing. </p><p> He entered the US market promising a better way through technology developed by his start-up, which he co-founded in 2019 with Dr Reza Katal, an Iranian permanent resident of Australia who earned his doctorate from the National University of Singapore.</p><p> \"We recycle 100 per cent of the battery, so nothing gets wasted,\" said Mr Farrant.</p><p> \"We take the highest value elements like nickel, cobalt, manganese, lithium and, to a lesser extent, graphite, and completely purify them to make sure that they're ready for reuse in batteries. </p><p> \"About 1 per cent goes into what we call the impurity stream and that goes into cement production, or alloy production, so all of it gets reused.\"</p><p> In the world of hydrogen fuel cells, Mr Jogjaman of Spectronik is serving an alternative that outclasses the usual batteries, used to power robots, drones and such, and can be refuelled faster than you can read an article on climate change. </p><p> The entrepreneur, who holds a master's in engineering, said his firm's portable hydrogen fuel cells offer three times the energy density of traditional batteries and can be refuelled in just five minutes. </p><p> They have worked well for one of his customers, a firm in San Antonio, Texas, that supplies autonomous lawnmowers for vegetation management at solar farms. </p><p> \"If the robot uses a battery, it can cut grass for an hour and has to be recharged for an hour. With our hydrogen fuel cell, it can cut grass for three hours and recharge in five minutes. This translates to huge productivity gains and cost savings,\" he added. </p><p> Mr Jogjaman's clients also include American defence and aerospace companies that cannot buy fuel cells from China, which the US regards as an adversary. He said: \"Because we are a Singapore company, we are uniquely positioned to serve US customers who cannot purchase fuel cells from other sources.\"</p><p> Beyond clean power, EnterpriseSG also sees opportunities for Singapore firms applying technology and innovation in the agriculture and food sectors. \"The consumer base in the US is shifting to be more health and environmentally conscious,\" said Ms Lim.</p><p> That was the draw for Mr Mathew Howe, an engineering graduate who founded Grobrix in 2019 after a career in financial markets.

It's a growing trend with people like myself who have young children. The produce is not fresh, the prices are going through the roof,\" said Mr Jason Capracotta, Grobrix's US general manager. He sees an opportunity with health- and price-conscious Americans not wanting veggies brought in on long-haul trucks. </p><p> As the US green scene braces itself for some turbulence after Trump returns to office in January, these Singapore firms are prepared to ride it out one recycled battery, one office lettuce at a time.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["EnterpriseSG has seen an increase in Singapore companies exploring US opportunities. \"We have supported over 70 per cent more companies to explore overseas activities in 2023 compared with that in 2022,\" Ms Lim said.

Good afternoon. I am delighted to be with you today at TechInnovation 2024. This event, organized by IPI, is an iconic feature of the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology or SWITCH.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>2. This year's conference theme is \"Sustainable Urban Living,\" an issue that affects both individuals and businesses, large or small.</p><p>3. The growth of the global population and cities continues to strain our energy resources. Singapore is not spared as one of the world's most densely populated cities. To overcome this, we harness technology and innovation to transform our city-state into a Smart Nation. The drive for Sustainable Urban Living is fundamental to our Smart Nation goal. It aims to integrate technology, data-driven decision-making, green infrastructure, and community engagement to create a more livable, efficient, and environmentally friendly city.</p><p>4. We aim to be a model for sustainable urban development globally. To succeed, we need SMEs to play an active role in our dynamic innovation ecosystem, which includes companies, research institutions, industry, and investors.</p><p>5.The Government is committed to supporting SMEs in their sustainable journey and helping them seize opportunities in the sustainable urban living sector. To achieve this, SMEs would need three critical ingredients: partners for technology, partners for mentorship, and partners for global expansion.</p><p>Partners for technology</p><p>6. First, partners for technology. All businesses must innovate to stay competitive in today's fast-paced world. Companies that embrace innovation are better positioned to adapt to market changes and offer new products and services.</p><p>7. Services like IPI's Tech Scouting help SMEs connect with potential partners, explore technology collaborations, and accelerate the development of their products and services. This is one way SMEs can get an extra hand in navigating the innovation landscape and identifying opportunities that complement their business needs.</p><p>a. One of the SMEs that has benefited from such assistance is Charged Asia, a Singapore-based electric vehicle company. IPI connected the company to KGS, a local recycling specialist, to handle the firm's end-of-life battery disposal. The two partners launched pilot trials on recovering battery materials. Their cooperation has not only given Charged Asia a competitive edge but has also fostered a more sustainable battery recycling ecosystem. Importantly, the advancement of such green technologies also positively impacts the environment.</p><p>Partners for mentorship</p><p>8. Second, partners for mentorship. Having the right mentors is equally vital for businesses to achieve meaningful growth aligned with their objectives.</p><p>a.Take the example of Creme Concepts, a local ice cream maker. It started with humble beginnings in farmers' markets and partnered with IPI to improve its internal processes and expand regionally.</p><p>b. IPI engaged industry veterans from its Innovation Advisors Programme to advise Crme Concepts on innovation, provide market insights, and scale its operations. The company was able to leverage the advisors' wealth of experience to transform and expand. Creme Concepts went on to redesign its factory, streamline production, align commercial strategies, and refresh its brand.</p><p>c.This collaboration enabled Creme Concepts to scale up operations and position itself for long-term growth. Its products are now found in Malaysia and Hong Kong.</p><p>Partners for global expansion</p><p>9. This brings me to my third point: SMEs would do well to seek suitable partners to establish their global footprint. By engaging and meeting with companies and potential partners worldwide, our SMEs can better understand different cultures, expectations, and market demands.</p><p>10. IPI's network of global partners offers our SMEs this opportunity. For instance, its partnerships with organisations in China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand open doors to fresh business potential.</p><p>a. One of IPI's partners, the National Eastern Tech-transfer Center (NETC) from China, works closely with companies to promote enterprise growth and focuses on emerging sectors like AI, healthcare, and energy.</p><p>b. In another partnership, the IPI and the Japan External Trade Organisation started the Japanese Corporates Technology Innovation (JCTI) Launchpad in April this year. This attracted top Japanese companies like Ricoh, Toyo Seikan, Panasonic, Nisshinbo, and Mitsui Chemicals. Panasonic and IPI have since partnered on an open innovation challenge to invite SMEs, startups, and research institutes worldwide to address Panasonic's challenges.</p><p>11. I commend IPI's efforts to advance such international collaborations. These initiatives not only showcase cutting-edge technologies but also provide a platform for multinational corporations, the government, and, most importantly, SMEs to co-create opportunities with one another.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>12. To conclude, I encourage SMEs to proactively seek innovation opportunities to build products and services that enhance their competitive edge.</p><p>13. During this conference, I hope you will gain insights into exciting areas such as the latest AI-driven solutions for smart cities, healthcare, and food sustainability. There is also a wealth of networking opportunities here. I hope you discover and nurture new relationships and partnerships to multiply your business.</p><p>14. The Government is fully committed to empowering SMEs to innovate, grow, and internationalise. The journey towards sustainable urban living is a collective effort that requires the collaboration of all stakeholders. Together, we can catalyse and create a better quality of life in our green city-state.</p><p>15. I wish you a successful and insightful conference!

However, Downing Street sought to get on the economic front foot on Sunday (Oct 13) and Monday with events at the UK Investment Summit in London ahead of the big Oct 30 budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The end-of-month fiscal event is shaping up to be the most important UK budget since at least the emergency fiscal statement in 2010 of the new Conservative government of then prime minister David Cameron. Moreover, it may even prove as politically decisive as the early budgets of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s.</p><p> Recognising the importance of the big occasion ahead, Keir Starmer's Labour government has begun its political choreography for the event.</p><p> \"Clean energy superpower\" </p><p> After uncovering a fiscal black hole of over GBP20 billion (S$34.1 billion) in July, after auditing the government's books, ministers are putting forward a more optimistic mood music at the summit events centred around the UK's long-term growth potential into the 2030s, including to become a \"clean energy superpower\". </p><p> In attendance at the summit events on Sunday and Monday were over 300 senior international business people and thinkers, including from Singapore. Key names include former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. </p><p> The political build-up for the summit began on Friday when Poppy Gustafsson, co-founder and former CEO of cyber firm Darktrace, was announced as the new UK investment minister at a meeting of English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish politicians in Edinburgh. </p><p> This was followed over the weekend with investment summit events in London attended by firms including Alphabet, Goldman Sachs and DeepMind.</p><p> Overall, the government welcomed around GBP50 billion of deal announcements at the events. This is roughly twice the GBP28 billion unveiled at the last such summit held under the former Conservative administration in 2023 of then prime minister Rishi Sunak.</p><p> Gustafsson will lead a beefed-up UK Office for Investment, which will bring together expertise from industry and business leaders, plus also 10 Downing Street, the Treasury and the Department of Business and Trade. This is part of a wider reform of the UK central government, to strengthen the nation's partnership with businesses.</p><p> An example of the innovation here is that the central government will harness other devolved political actors, including the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and mayors of major cities including London, Birmingham and Manchester. </p><p> The goal is promoting the UK, including in Asia, to capture a greater share of internationally mobile investment in strategic sectors, and motivate domestic businesses to boost their investment and scale up their growth.</p><p> One key economic enabler of this revamped approach is a new UK industry strategy, announced on Sunday, with a new advisory council to spearhead this led by Microsoft UK CEO Clare Barclay. The full membership will be announced soon to help unleash the potential of high productivity sectors to spur growth, spread wealth and drive up employment.</p><p> The new industrial strategy focuses on eight areas the UK excels in, or has the potential to do so: advanced manufacturing; clean energy industries; creative industries; defence; digital and technologies; financial services; life sciences; and professional and business services. </p><p> Over the last quarter of a century, the top 30 per cent of UK sectors ranked by productivity in 1997 were responsible for generating roughly 60 per cent of the economy's entire productivity growth so the government wants the new strategy to channel support to sectors and geographical clusters that have the highest potential for the next decade.</p><p> The government has also launched a supply chain taskforce. This will assess where supply chains critical to the UK's economic security and resilience could be vulnerable to disruption.</p><p> The task force's work will focus particularly on supply chains critical to the UK's economic security and resilience, especially those in the eight growth-driving sectors outlined in the industrial strategy. The goal is seeking to ensure that the government works with business to address these risks, building the conditions required to deliver secure, inclusive growth.</p><p> Of the approximately GBP50 billion in investment announced at the summit, about half is in clean energy investment across the UK's nations and regions.</p><p> One driver of this spurt is the launch of the new Great British Energy -- an investment body and publicly owned energy generation company which aims to ensure a massive expansion in clean energy to help enhance UK energy security.</p><p> Earlier this month, the government also confirmed funding to launch the UK's first carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) sites in Teesside and Merseyside. In a more than GBP20 billion commitment, two new CCUS-enabled hydrogen projects will help remove over 8.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year -- the equivalent of taking around four million cars off the road.</p><p> Moving the needleIn July, moreover, the government overturned a nine-year ban on onshore wind power construction under the last several Conservative governments. This was followed by one of the most successful renewable energy auction rounds in history.</p><p> Examples of the investment include that by Iberdrola -- one of the biggest energy companies in Europe -- which is doubling its UK investment, through Scottish Power, from GBP12 billion to GBP24 billion over the next four years. This includes GBP4 billion for the East Anglia 2 wind farm off the Suffolk coast in England.</p><p> Two wind energy players Orsted and Greenvolt have also confirmed they will invest a further GBP8 billion (Orsted) and GBP2.5 billion (Greenvolt), respectively, in planned offshore wind farms. Moreover, SeAH Wind has made an additional GBP225 million investment into a now total GBP900 million wind technology manufacturing project in Teesside, North East England, thanks to new backing from UK Export Finance.</p><p> Other firms making announcements include Macquarie, BW Group, and Holtec. Macquarie is planning investment of GBP1.3 billion into new green infrastructure including in Stow, Gloucestershire, and its Roadchef portfolio company, which installs electric car ultra-fast charging points along the UK motorway network.</p><p> Meanwhile, BW Group has green-lit a GBP300 million investment into a new battery energy storage project in Birmingham. Holtec has also confirmed GBP325 million in a new factory in South Yorkshire which will supply materials for power stations, including Hinkley Point C.</p><p> Taken together, the investment summit has therefore moved the needle significantly in the government's attempt to shift the UK into a clean-energy superpower. While this is a vote of confidence from the international community, many market participants still await the Oct 30 budget before making final decisions on the new government.</p><p> The writer is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Other firms making announcements include Macquarie, BW Group, and Holtec.

Additionally, China will invest in upgrading infrastructure, providing resources and conducting training to build local authorities\u2019 capacity in disaster response.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        The price of climate change in China</p><p>                        These efforts aim to improve China\u2019s ability to manage climate risks and promote sustainable adaptation at the national level, while also strengthening disaster risk management and community preparedness through improved monitoring, forecasting and early warning systems.</p><p>                        China\u2019s First Vice-Premier Xuexiang Ding delivers a statement during the United Nations climate change conference (COP29), in Baku, Azerbaijan, on 12 November 2024.</p><p>                        The new plan highlights the growing recognition of the urgent threat posed by climate change, reflecting a heightened recognition of its urgent impacts. This proactive approach comes in response to the severe economic and human costs of recent climate-related disasters. In July alone, extreme weather \u2014 primarily heavy rains and floods \u2014 caused 76.85 billion RMB (US$10.1 billion) in economic losses, affecting over 26.4 million people, displacing 1.1 million and damaging thousands of homes.</p><p>                        These staggering impacts highlight China\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, with rising coastal flooding, urban waterlogging, droughts and heavy rainfall intensifying climate risks nationwide. Notably, recent extremes \u2014 including the highest national temperature on record and Beijing receiving 60% of its annual rainfall in just 83 hours \u2014 demonstrate the growing threat. The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p>                        Projections paint an even more alarming picture. By the end of the century, heatwaves could triple, and water scarcity could worsen, deepening regional disparities. Economic losses are expected to soar, with a 1.5\u00b0C global temperature increase potentially leading to US$112 billion in direct flooding-related losses \u2014 four times the level seen between 2006-2018. Coastal cities like Shanghai face additional risks from extreme high tides. These projections highlight the pressing need for China to prioritise climate resilience and adaptation as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe.</p><p>                        This file photo taken on 17 September 2024 shows buildings silhouetted as clouds drift past the sun in Shanghai.</p><p>                        In response to growing concerns over climate change, Beijing has recognised the urgent need for effective adaptation strategies to protect infrastructure and maintain the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s legitimacy. This approach is influenced by Mao Zedong\u2019s belief that \u201cman must conquer nature\u201d, and has led to a focus on climate resilience and infrastructure in national policies, driven by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts.</p><p>                        Managing extreme weather has long been tied to political legitimacy in China. Historically, failures in this area \u2014 particularly flooding \u2014 have been seen as signs of a loss of authority, linked to the ancient concept of the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d. This practice dates back more than 4,000 years, to Yu the Great of the Xia dynasty, who is said to have tamed the Yellow River.</p><p>                        \u2018Sponge city\u2019: mismanagement impacting effectiveness</p><p>                        Challenges lie ahead. One of the biggest concerns being the potentially high costs of climate adaptation projects. The \u201csponge city\u201d concept (\u6d77\u7ef5\u57ce\u5e02), introduced in 2015 in Chinese cities to manage stormwater through permeable surfaces and green infrastructure, exemplifies these challenges. </p><p>                        Although the central government initially allocated 400-600 million RMB per city involved in the 16-city pilot infrastructure-driven programme, total spending on sponge city projects by 2017 had surpassed US$12 billion, with Beijing covering only 15-20% of the costs. The remainder is shouldered by local governments and the private sector.\u00a0</p><p>                        ... many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. \u2014 Professor Kongjian Yu, Dean, College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University</p><p>                        Despite over 1 trillion RMB (US$140 billion) being invested by cities between 2016-2020, these projects have struggled to cope with severe flooding, highlighting concerns about their effectiveness. Notably, in 2021, \u201chistorically rare\u201d rainfall led to devastating floods in Zhengzhou, affecting over 14 million people, causing 398 deaths and 53.2 billion RMB (US$8 billion) in economic losses. </p><p>                        However, some critics have argued that the sponge city design, intended to handle one-in-30-year rainfall, proved inadequate in the face of such extremes. Media reports at the time suggested that sponge city infrastructure can handle a maximum of 200 millimetres (mm) of rain per day. </p><p>                        A view of Zhengzhou in Henan province, 12 December 2024.</p><p>                        In contrast, Zhengzhou saw rainfall in excess of 200 mm in just one hour. Others note that mismanagement by local officials, who ignored early flood warnings, exacerbated the crisis. </p><p>                        Professor Kongjian Yu, dean of the College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University, and a champion of the sponge city concept, said in a recent interview that the fact that cities are flooding shows that they are not creating enough sponge-like infrastructure. From his perspective, many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. </p><p>                        Further complicating the situation, local governments already burdened by debt may struggle to prioritise such expensive and long-term climate adaptation projects. In the face of a national economic slowdown, many localities are resorting to asset liquidation to address immediate revenue shortfalls in a process described as \u201csmashing iron pots and selling the steel\u201d. This short-term focus risks undermining long-term climate resilience, as local authorities may prioritise quick fixes over necessary investments in sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>                        Disconnect between Beijing and local governments and among regions</p><p>                        As the central government pushes forward with projects aimed at mitigating climate impacts, the widening gap between high-level planning and on-the-ground implementation becomes increasingly apparent, raising concerns about the sustainability and effectiveness of these efforts in addressing climate resilience in cities. Without a unified approach, the effectiveness of China\u2019s climate adaptation efforts will remain in question.</p><p>                        ... China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas where the lack of comprehensive, delta-wide plans has led to a fragmented approach to disaster management. Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        Completed in 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was the first major bridge built over the Yangtze river.</p><p>                        The dangers of fragmented policy and poor coordination between municipalities and regional governments, particularly in flood-prone areas, must be considered too. Recent studies have highlighted this issue, using the example of China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas where the lack of comprehensive, delta-wide plans has led to a fragmented approach to disaster management. Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        The consequences of this were seen notably, in the aftermath of the 2023 Beijing floods. For instance, netizens pointed out that government bodies often look after their own jurisdiction, responding in isolation rather than through coordinated regional efforts. In their haste to manage the immediate crisis, efforts to divert floodwaters upstream only worsened conditions in downstream areas.</p><p>                        ... the successful implementation of this strategy will require significant investment, coordination across government departments, and a shift in how policies are executed at the local level.</p><p>                        Major overhaul</p><p>                        In the face of the challenging situation, the Chinese government is likely to intensify its efforts to enhance climate resilience in the coming years. Recognising the urgent need for coordinated action, Beijing aims to strengthen local governments\u2019 capacity to address climate change by integrating adaptation strategies into urban planning and infrastructure development.\u00a0</p><p>                        This photo taken on 29 June 2024 shows an aerial view of flooded buildings after a flood peak on the Wuyang river at Qiandongnan, in China\u2019s southwest Guizhou province.</p><p>                        In line with this, the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (2022\u20132035) lays out a framework for resilience, emphasising improved weather monitoring, and bolstered agricultural, water, and urban infrastructure systems. However, the successful implementation of this strategy will require significant investment, coordination across government departments, and a shift in how policies are executed at the local level.</p><p>                        As extreme weather intensifies, China is prioritising disaster prevention and community preparedness but bridging the gap between ambitious plans and on-the-ground implementation is crucial for long-term climate resilience.</p><p>                        Related: Storing sunshine: How northwest China is making renewable energy reliable | China\u2019s environmental focus in South China Sea: Questionable motivations | China\u2019s booming nuclear sector lobbies for green vouchers to ensure profits</p><p>                        The photo taken on 6 July 2024 shows an aerial view of a partially submerged Guanyin temple in floodwaters in the swollen Yangtze River in Ezhou, central China\u2019s Hubei province.</p>", "publisher": "ThinkChina", "instances": ["\u2018Sponge city\u2019: mismanagement impacting effectiveness                        Challenges lie ahead.

It is not only the world's most populous region, but also the fastest-growing. Asia is expected to contribute 60 per cent of global growth in 2024 and within the area, the 10 members of Asean make up the beating heart of the region, driving connectivity within the region and with the global economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But this rapid growth comes at a cost. Asia is now the leading contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. More critically, the region faces disproportionate risks from climate change. Asean nations including the Philippines, Myanmar and Thailand are ranked among the top 10 countries most severely affected by weather-related loss events and most vulnerable to climate risks. </p><p> Last year alone, Asean countries were hit by more than a thousand natural disasters. These affected 22.5 million people, displaced 1.8 million, and resulted in damages of more than US$600 million. </p><p> Sadly, these disasters are just the beginning of the coming global climate crisis. We must recognise that many natural disasters are no longer natural, but are due to manmade climate change.</p><p> This stark reality underscores the urgent need for Asia to accelerate its efforts towards a green transition, to mitigate climate change and to conserve our planet's living environment.</p><p> The transition towards net-zero industries represents not only a challenge but an opportunity. Asia's future competitiveness depends on sustainability. </p><p> Economies that embrace sustainable development will become the preferred destination for trade and investment. Looking ahead, secure and affordable renewable energy will be the key engine for economic development. On the supply side, this transition will create many industries and job opportunities.</p><p> Significant challengeHowever, as the theme of this year's Asean-Asia Forum rightly identifies, global shifts are casting doubt over this ambition. Increasing risks of geo-economic fragmentation pose a significant challenge to achieving the green transition. </p><p> Today, we are witnessing increased trade restrictions and anti-competitive measures, especially in strategic sectors such as semiconductors and renewables. Around 3,000 trade-restricting measures were imposed in 2023 alone, nearly three times the number in 2019. </p><p> As the strategic importance of green sectors becomes more evident, we also see more restrictive policies placed on these sectors and their supply chains, including import tariffs and domestic content requirements. Additionally, there is an increase in export restrictions to prevent key technology from flowing to others. </p><p> Here, there is a real risk that the economic opportunity presented by the green transition becomes its own victim.</p><p> It is imperative that we overcome these tensions and work together to combat climate change. Supply chain disruptions increase the cost of the green transition for all of us and hinder progress towards our collective goals. We need avenues for trade, capital and knowledge to continue flowing. </p><p> While it's crucial to support the growth of local industries, we must avoid the pitfalls of protectionism that can hinder global cooperation and technology exchange. The key is to strike a judicious balance.</p><p> As we navigate the risks of fragmentation, we must continue to advocate strongly for globalisation and multilateralism. Asean economies have a deep history of economic collaboration, and many are today highly connected by trade and plugged into global supply chains. Encouragingly, there are now more cross-border sales and transmission of renewable energy in the region, and a more integrated Asean grid is in the works. </p><p> As Asean is demonstrating, multilateral cooperation presents the most efficient and effective approach to solve climate change. Thus, we must work collaboratively to reduce trade frictions and invest in regional connectivity, especially in Asia.</p><p> More than ever, multilateral development banks (MDB) have a pivotal role to play in facilitating international cooperation and directing resources to tackle these urgent global challenges. </p><p> Driving cooperationThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is heeding the call. We are firmly committed to financing infrastructure for tomorrow and work every day to promote sustainable development and regional cooperation. I am proud to say that 60 per cent of our financing in 2023 was directed towards green infrastructure, and 23 per cent was invested in cross-border connectivity.</p><p> Furthermore, AIIB has sought to drive cooperation across the MDB system. The organisation co-financed a US$230 million pumped hydropower project in Indonesia with the World Bank, and with the Asian Development Bank, a US$150 million cross-border wind power project in Laos supplying green energy to Vietnam. </p><p> Last year, we also provided a US$1 billion guarantee facility for the World Bank, increasing lending capacity for both AIIB and the World Bank.</p><p> In July 2023, we began to align all our financing activities with the Paris Agreement. Our Climate Action Plan further committed to using our resources, expertise and partnerships to help our members both mitigate and adapt to the climate change crisis. </p><p> By 2030, we expect our cumulative climate finance to reach US$50 billion.</p><p> In 2024, we introduced an instrument -- Climate-Focused Policy-Based Financing. Moving beyond project-by-project lending, this new instrument enables AIIB to support members to undertake climate-positive policy reforms and scale up climate finance. </p><p> Our policy-based financing will put specific emphasis on policy reforms that are conducive to crowding in private-sector investments. </p><p> Working with other MDBs, we have already approved a US$400 million programme to support Bangladesh's efforts in mainstreaming climate change adaptation and mitigation.</p><p> Finally, at the most recent meeting of MDB heads, AIIB -- along with nine other major MDBs -- committed to concrete and actionable deliverables in several critical areas: scaling up MDB financing capacity; boosting joint action on climate change; strengthening country-level collaboration and co-financing; and importantly, catalysing private-sector mobilisation.</p><p> Just as Asean's 10 member countries have demonstrated the organising power of multilateralism, MDBs must continue to promote regional interconnectivity in this time of rising geo-economic fragmentation. Importantly, MDBs must also deepen our collaboration to address the spectre of climate challenges ahead. </p><p> Only by working together as a system can we increase our climate finance at the speed and scale required to finance humanity's moonshot towards net zero.</p><p> The writer is president and chair of the board of directors at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Driving cooperationThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is heeding the call.

It has prompted shifts in behaviour, and inspired concerted action. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Governments worldwide are enacting regulatory measures, such as carbon taxes, subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), and plans for green infrastructure development. Businesses are committing to net-zero emissions, setting science-based targets, and encouraging their supply chains to adopt more sustainable practices. Consumers increasingly favour sustainable products, and are altering their spending patterns accordingly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Meanwhile, some investors are advocating for action, heightening their focus on climate-related risks and setting minimum climate standards, which in turn influences portfolio allocations.</p><p> Although these transformations pose risks to asset prices, we recognise that they also herald a unique investment opportunity for our generation. </p><p> We advocate for a climate strategy that yields both environmental and financial returns, moving beyond traditional approaches. Generally, strategies focused solely on low emissions often rely on historical data without adequately accounting for shifts in business models or the tangible impacts on the environment. </p><p> Similarly, while green bond strategies contribute to funding eco-friendly projects, a strategy exclusively centred on green bonds may suffer from limited diversification, lower yield return and extended durations.</p><p> Such traditional methodologies do not sufficiently address the physical consequences of climate change, nor do they focus adequately on adaptation. Current policies place us on a trajectory towards a 2.4 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures, a scenario corroborated by our climate analysis. This warming path is likely to exacerbate weather volatility and temperature extremes, affecting both society at large and asset values.</p><p> Crafting a solutionAt the heart of a favourable solution is the conviction that climate outcomes should prioritise real-world emissions reduction, support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and facilitate adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change. Every investment decision should be made through a climate lens, necessitating a bespoke framework. This approach, coupled with a global opportunity set and a strategy focused on best ideas, is designed to yield compelling returns and income.</p><p> Climate transition in Asia will likely be core to the outcomes that are achieved on a global level considering the size of Asia's population, projected economic growth, exposure to higher emitting industries, and the opportunity to potentially leapfrog high-emitting technologies and adopt low-carbon solutions. Asian companies are often national, regional or even global leaders in their respective industries, which could translate to meaningful impact when they adopt more sustainable trajectories. </p><p> Covering the global universe, the strategy centres on identifying and investing in ambitious companies that are leading the charge in their respective industries. These trailblazers are making significant strides in real-world decarbonisation, disrupting traditional business models, pioneering innovative technologies, and responding proactively to evolving consumer demands. By aligning with such leaders, investors may capitalise on the growth of the climate market and achieve superior performance.</p><p> Three types of companies are worth a look -- those in high-emitting sectors that are setting the standard for emissions reduction; innovators who are developing the technologies and products essential for decarbonisation efforts; and entities that help societies adjust to the impacts of climate change and contribute to global climate resilience. </p><p> By carefully selecting companies that align with these themes, investors may seize a significant growth opportunity and contribute meaningfully to the efforts against climate change.</p><p> Fixed income instruments, including green and municipal bonds, are pivotal in channelling funds towards projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience. A comprehensive fixed income strategy should span various segments -- investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging market debt. </p><p> An additional nuance within the Asian bond universe is the presence of large state-owned enterprises that are focused on delivering policy objectives instead of solely profit, allowing bond investors the opportunity to lend to issuers that are involved in national infrastructure projects that are part of the government's strategy to move towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p> We currently see the opportunities in Asia in the renewable energy space, EVs and its corresponding value chain, as well as large corporates that are adopting more sustainable ways of manufacturing their products. </p><p> We expect the potential pipeline from Asia to continue to grow, and could span a wide variety of opportunities including low carbon materials production and climate adaptation.</p><p> Selecting the right theme is merely the beginning. Active company selection becomes crucial in ensuring that investments genuinely enhance the portfolio's value. </p><p> For credit investors, the application of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards across all issuers requires careful consideration, especially given the disparities between high-yield and investment-grade issuers. High-yield issuers -- often smaller or newer companies -- may not have the luxury of dedicated ESG teams, established green-bond frameworks, or the capacity to generate comprehensive sustainability reports. Consequently, companies genuinely committed to sustainability might be overlooked due to their inability to showcase their ESG credentials prominently.</p><p> A recent example is Ardagh Metal Packaging, a US-listed global producer of infinitely recyclable metal drinks cans. Until recently, this company lagged in ESG disclosures despite its strong alignment with sustainability, particularly within the circular economy and waste reduction sectors. In 2022, its recycling initiatives were estimated to have avoided 3.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions compared to using virgin materials.</p><p> This case highlights that ESG assessment should transcend mere box-ticking; there is no substitute for thorough research. Investors adept at identifying firms with commendable ESG practices, albeit with limited disclosure, stand to gain by investing ahead of the curve, before enhanced transparency garners wider market recognition. </p><p> A promising landscapeThe future of climate change investing looks bright, buoyed by the escalating global emphasis on environmental sustainability. Despite concerns, we maintain that the burgeoning demand for climate-related investments will not alone lead to overvaluation. The arena of climate transition presents a vast and perpetually evolving landscape of opportunities, far from being exhausted by current interest levels.</p><p> Most importantly, we believe a climate change investment strategy should have a dual objective -- achieving meaningful climate impact alongside robust financial returns. This approach transcends mere trend-following. It is about pinpointing and supporting innovative companies that lead the charge in industry transformation and real-world decarbonisation efforts. </p><p> This strategy opens the door to a wide spectrum of opportunities, enabling investors to engage with ventures that are not just promising in terms of returns but are also pivotal in the global transition to a more sustainable future.</p><p> It is imperative to curate a well-balanced portfolio encompassing leaders in emissions reduction, innovators in technology, and contributors to climate adaptation. This diversified strategy ensures resilience against potential overvaluation in any single region, sector or asset class by spreading exposure across the varied facets of climate transition.</p><p> The writer is investment director of fixed income, abrdn</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["CLIMATE change is the paramount challenge of our era.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is delighted to co-host today's event with the World Bank.</p><p>2. If there was a Dummy's Guide to Decarbonisation, it would probably say something like this: clean the grid, electrify everything and leave a small carbon budget for genuinely hard-to-abate sectors.</p><p>3. The focus on coal transition addresses the first of those three limbs: clean the grid. Today, our grids are primarily powered by fossil fuels, accounting for over 60% of the share of global electricity generation. Coal continues to remain the largest source of electricity globally and remains the dominant energy source for many countries.[1]</p><p>4. There is some reason for optimism. Based on IEA forecasts, more than a third of the world's electricity will come from renewables by next year, surpassing coal as the largest source of supply. In advanced economies last year, renewables accounted for 34% of total power generation, while coal's share plummeted to a historic low of 17%.[2]</p><p>5. However, the transition is taking place unevenly and we are seeing a different trajectory in developing regions. For instance, in Southeast Asia, coal continues to account for over 40% of the energy mix.[3] Renewables make up only a quarter of the region's power generation.[4] We have a fair bit of ground to close, given the International Renewable Energy Agency's (IRENA) estimates that renewables will need to account for between 90-100% of electricity generation in 2050, if are to keep to a 1.5 degree scenario for Southeast Asia.[5]</p><p>6. We should all be concerned about this because one in every seven tonnes of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere comes from a coal plant in Asia. If we are serious about the climate transition, we need to get serious about Asian coal.</p><p>7. If nothing is done, coal power will continue to be dominant for three main reasons:</p><p>a. Coal is already locked in. Asia's coal plants are young, less than 15 years old on average. There is established infrastructure, and long-term power purchase agreements (PPA). These make transitioning from coal a costly process.</p><p>b. The second reason underpinning the dominance is that bottlenecks in grid infrastructure are hindering renewable energy deployment. There is no transition without transmission. There is little value in adding more generation capacity if the electricity cannot reach the intended end-user. In Vietnam for example, the influx of solar and wind capacity in the South has caused renewable energy generation curtailment. At the same time, the country's coal-dependent northern provinces face supply challenges.</p><p>c. Lastly, if we only think of coal in economic terms, we have missed the plot. Coal is not just an economic asset; it is an asset with deep security and social implications. Coal is viewed as essential for energy security given its reliability as baseload capacity. In Asia, some 6.7 million jobs are tied to the coal industry, from mining to power generation. The transition away from coal, if not managed carefully, could lead to significant social disruption, particularly in regions where alternative employment opportunities are scarce.</p><p>8. These three challenges - (i) lock in, (ii) grid infrastructure, and (iii) the broader entrenchment of coal, particularly in emerging markets - highlight why broad-brush efforts to phasing out coal have met with limited success. Because coal has deep economic, social and existential roots, we need to complement these efforts with market-based solutions.</p><p>9. Market-based approaches are not just purely theoretical, they are already being implemented with promising results. Such mechanisms are being pioneered through initiatives such as the U.S. Energy Transition Accelerator and the Just Energy Transition Partnership. Recent modelling by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has found that the decommissioning of over 800 coal power plants in emerging economies can be achieved through large-scale investments in renewables and restructured power purchase agreements. All costs would be covered through this market-based approach, including financing PPAs, the development of renewables, retraining workers and upgrading grid infrastructure.[6]</p><p>10. Given that market-based approaches are the focus of today's event, I thought it would be useful for me to outline the key components of such an approach.</p><p>11. I would say there are three key components - the three \"As\": ambition, arsenal and actors.</p><p>12. First, ambition. What is essential here is to ensure strong ambition loops between demand and supply. Market-based approaches work best when demand and supply goals and parameters are aligned. This is a key principle underpinning the work to develop transition credits. Transition credits are a new form of carbon credits that can be generated from the emissions reduced by retiring a coal plant early and transitioning to cleaner energy sources. For this to be a viable financing tool, the supply of transition credits has to be of high integrity. Confidence in the integrity of the credits will reinforce demand. This is where we need to build a virtuous loop of demand and supply to build a market for transition credits.</p><p>13. To concretely unpack how this can be achieved, MAS launched the Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION) at COP28 with more than 30 members. TRACTION is exploring how to support the development of high-integrity supply and build up buyer confidence in transition credits. This means hearing from demand-side players, including sovereigns, corporates and sectoral bodies from both the compliance and voluntary markets. We are asking them what key attributes they look for when purchasing credits. This, in turn, feeds into TRACTION's work on the supply side, to identify suitable coal retirement projects for the generation of such credits.</p><p>14. Beyond supply and demand, what makes TRACTION different is a third focus on making transactions scalable. This means looking beyond pilots. We are looking to build replicable ambition loops between demand and supply at scale. Part of this involves mapping the risks faced by stakeholders in a transition credit value chain, and identifying ways to mitigate these risks.</p><p>15. The second \"A\" in a strong market-based approach is arsenal. This refers to the need to develop an arsenal of tools and mechanisms to improve the economic viability and risk profile of coal decommissioning projects. Concessional capital is certainly a key tool, but it cannot be our only tool. Market-based approaches use a variety of complementary tools, such as blended finance, technical assistance, guarantees, and carbon credits. Each tool seeks to address a different gap.</p><p>16. Applying this to the example on Transition Credits, we need to be receptive to a wide arsenal of approaches even as we address the foundational issue of credit integrity. Several methodologies that prescribe how high integrity transition credits can be generated are being developed as we speak. Some of these are premised on a project-based approach, where the mitigation activity is implemented by each individual coal plant. Others use a sectoral approach where the mitigation activities are managed across a jurisdiction, at the national or subnational level.</p><p>17. TRACTION is examining both approaches. Let me share three initial observations:</p><p>a. First, project-based and sectoral approaches use different guardrails to meet high integrity standards and Just Transition needs. Importantly, these requirements also have to consider implementation practicalities.</p><p>* For instance, project-based methodologies require a just transition plan to be developed at the plant level with stakeholders. Sectoral approach would call for one at the national or subnational level.</p><p>*While the approaches may be different, both stipulate that part of the credit proceeds must be directed to just transition.</p><p>b. Second, jurisdictions and plant owners should choose a crediting methodology that suits their local context.</p><p>* For example, where there are no site-appropriate options for cleaner energy, a sectoral approach may be considered provided there is a national energy transition plan.</p><p>c. Third, with multiple approaches under development, stakeholders facing different circumstances will have more options to accelerate a just coal transition action globally.</p><p>* We must recognise that energy transition will not be homogenous as markets have their unique needs for energy security and growth. And the economics of energy transition for each market will also be different.</p><p>* This goes back to my point on the need to have an arsenal of tools. Different methodologies can and should be part of the toolkit to encourage more countries and plant owners to take action today.</p><p>18. The final \"A\" is actors. We need everyone to step up to the plate more decisively. We need better coordination across actors so that those with the ability to step in can quickly plug the gaps. Governments, development finance institutions, and philanthropies could provide concessional capital. Multilateral development banks can provide technical assistance, including advisory and structuring support, and commercial capital. We also need to more extensively harness the capabilities of financial institutions, such as insurance players, to provide innovative risk mitigation solutions across the project development lifecycle.</p><p>19. We are starting to see the beginnings of this in the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P), the US$5bn blended finance platform that we launched at COP28 last year. One specific theme under FAST-P is the Energy Transition Acceleration Fund (ETAF), which is being developed in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP). The fund focusses on energy transition projects in Asia, such as the early phaseout of coal assets and replacement with renewables. The ADB provides not just concessional capital from its donors, but also its structuring expertise, experience in working on the Energy Transition Mechanism in Asia, and a pipeline of potential projects. GEAPP, with its experience in the energy transition, and a network of willing partners with a focus on green energy access, is well placed to ensure that investments in the space are socially inclusive and just. We are also grateful for the World Bank's partnership in FAST-P. Singapore is working with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other partners on a Green Investment Partnership under FAST-P to finance marginally bankable green infrastructure projects and companies in Asia. IFC's experience in deploying blended finance and scaling infrastructure projects has been invaluable.</p><p>20. Market-based approaches are not just a novelty or an interesting talking point. They are a necessity if we are to accelerate the coal transition at the scale we need. For these approaches to work, I have outlined three key \"A's\" that are essential: (i) Ambition loops to harness the market-making power of demand and supply, (ii) the ability and willingness to tap on a wide Arsenal of tools, and (iii) a strong ecosystem of Actors that readily step up to play critical roles.</p><p>21. I would also add a fourth \"A\" - Action. I have outlined some concrete workstreams and initiatives that can make decisive impact on coal transition. I hope you will step forward to contribute to this work.</p><p>22. With this, I look forward to the panel discussion that will cover a number of innovative market-based approaches, and to the fruitful discussions that will no doubt follow.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] Ember, 2024 - with major processing by Our World in Data.

Good afternoon.</p><p>2. Let me start by congratulating the Singapore Reinsurers Association for the 20th anniversary of its flagship event, the Singapore International Reinsurance Conference (SIRC).</p><p>a. Since its inception in 1991, the SIRC has grown into a leading forum for reinsurers, insurers and reinsurance brokers to discuss topical issues facing the global reinsurance industry, and as a networking platform for reinsurance deals.</p><p>b. Today, we have about 3,300 delegates gathered here from over 65 countries, including a strong bench of global and regional leaders.</p><p>3. This year's strong turnout reflects the strength of Singapore's insurance industry.</p><p>a. Gross premiums for general insurance grew 7.5% year-on-year to reach S$13.5 billion in 2023.</p><p>b. Brokerage revenues increased by 9% year-on-year to S$847 million.</p><p>c. At the same time, Singapore's reinsurance premiums grew 31% year-on-year to S$27.6 billion in 2023, accounting for about 21% of Asia's reinsurance market.</p><p>4. This comes on the back of a resilient global reinsurance industry.</p><p>a. Global reinsurance capital has grown by 3.7% since end 2023 to reach a new high of US$695 billion in the first half of 2024, a level not seen since 2021.[1]</p><p>b. This was driven by retained earnings, more disciplined underwriting, and improved investment performance.</p><p>c. The industry has returned to profitability, with reinsurers' return on equity reaching 17.6% in the first half of 2024.[2]</p><p>5. This puts the reinsurance industry in a strong position to support the growth of Asia, as it navigates four key transitions in the years ahead - namely, climate, energy, digital, and demographic.</p><p>Climate transition</p><p>6. I will start with the climate transition. This is something which the insurance industry is familiar with, given its traditional role in providing natural catastrophe insurance coverage.</p><p>7. It is not so much that climate change is happening, but the pace at which it is accelerating which is of increasing concern. This is in turn challenging risk projections based off historical data.</p><p>a. In the past five years, annual insured losses from natural catastrophes averaged US$106 billion, up from less than US$83 billion in the previous five-year period.[3]</p><p>b. Latest models indicate the insurance industry needs to be prepared for an average annual insured loss of US$151 billion, or higher.[4]</p><p>8. Asia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It also suffers from a significant protection gap, particularly in terms of catastrophe coverage.</p><p>a. Total economic losses in the Asia-Pacific region for 2023 amounted to US$65 billion, of which 91% was not insured. This compares with a 30% protection gap in the United States.[5]</p><p>b. Based on the current trajectory, global temperatures are expected to increase by about 2.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels without more aggressive actions. Under this scenario, Asia could lose about 20% of its GDP by 2048 from 2021 levels, whilst ASEAN collectively could lose about 29% of its GDP.[6]</p><p>9. There is therefore both an imminent need and opportunity for the insurance industry to address the underinsurance gap arising from climate change, even as the world scrambles to mitigate the global impact of climate change.</p><p>a. To do so, the industry will need to work closely with governments, academia and technology providers, to enhance its risk models, scenario analysis and data on the physical impact of climate change in Asia.</p><p>b. I therefore encourage the insurance industry to tap on Singapore's growing applied climate risk research ecosystem.</p><p>i. Singapore has close to 10 institutions[7] which provide research and insights on the physical impact of climate risk and related issues in the region, such as sea level rise, extreme weather events, climate impact modelling, and nature-based solutions.</p><p>ii. Insurers, risk modelling firms, and brokers can leverage the work of these institutions as a foundation to layer on economic impact assessments, data and risk models, and hence enhance their assessments, disclosures and portfolio risk management strategies.</p><p>c. With these analyses, the industry can also better advise clients how to reduce their risk - for example, manufacturers could raise their factory floor, install flood barriers or elevate critical machinery above base flood elevation, in anticipation of frequent flooding as a result of sea level rising.</p><p>d. In turn, this will enable the industry to offer tailored products to provide sustainably priced, effective insurance coverage against natural catastrophes over the longer term.</p><p>Energy Transition</p><p>10. Let me move on to the energy transition.</p><p>11. Unlocking renewable sources of energy is key to enabling Asia to grow its economies while transitioning towards net-zero.</p><p>a. Asia accounts for half of global greenhouse gas emissions, as most of its energy needs today are being met through fossil fuels, including coal.</p><p>b. Moreover, much of Asia is developing, and its energy needs are still rising.</p><p>c. It is critical that we catalyse investments into renewable energy generation and transmission.</p><p>i. In fact, investments in renewable energy generation in Asia Pacific are poised to double during the current decade to US$1.3 trillion by 2030.[8]</p><p>1. This comprises a sizeable pipeline of renewable energy infrastructure projects, including solar, hydropower and wind.</p><p>ii. To enhance electricity connectivity within ASEAN, the International Energy Agency estimates that an overall grid investment of about $21 billion annually is needed from 2026 to 2030 and a further $31 billion annually from 2031 to 2035[9].</p><p>12. Amidst the energy transition, there are opportunities for specialty insurers and reinsurers to step up risk financing and insurance solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies.</p><p>a. It is estimated that Asia Pacific will account for a quarter, or US$59 billion of cumulative global renewable energy insurance premiums between 2022 and 2035.[10]</p><p>13. Yet compared to natural catastrophe insurance, there is less historical track record of risk assessment and loss profiles for renewable energy development in Asia.</p><p>a. Such projects will also be exposed to risks from potential damage from physical elements, such as heavy winds and storms, as well as the additional risk arising from the integration of energy storage systems with renewables.</p><p>b. To bridge these gaps, the industry must work closely with the renewable energy sector to develop new risk assessment frameworks, risk engineering methodologies, and sector-specific solutions.</p><p>c. This will improve the financial viability, risk management, and resilience of renewable energy and decarbonisation projects in the region.</p><p>14. There is also room to deploy solutions such as parametric insurance covers, as well as pre- Final Investment Decision, or pre-FID, insurance solutions[11], such as technology performance guarantees[12] and counter-party credit covers[13].</p><p>a. Parametric insurance covers can address specific coverage needs which may not be supported by traditional insurance, given the highly customisable nature.</p><p>i. MAS is studying ways to support the growth of parametric insurance, including through research on the regulatory treatment of such solutions in the region as well as information on independent and reliable data resources.</p><p>b. I encourage the industry to study pre-FID stage insurance solutions for projects in Asia, especially where projects are facing uncertainties.</p><p>i. This is a nascent space in the region, and there is room for the industry to innovate and pilot solutions offering protection during critical early stages of project development.</p><p>15. Insurers can also support the energy transition by investing directly in green infrastructure.</p><p>a. In fact, insurers are some of the world's largest institutional investors, holding more than US$40 trillion in assets.[14] In the Asia-Pacific, insurance assets are estimated to be about US$10 trillion.[15]</p><p>b. The long duration of infrastructure investments makes such assets a good match for the long-term liabilities of say life insurers.</p><p>c. To facilitate greater allocation of assets to infrastructure, MAS had recently issued a public consultation proposing a differentiated capital treatment for infrastructure assets that meet certain criteria to enjoy diversification benefits or lower risk charges than other debt and equity assets.</p><p>d. MAS will also be piloting a differentiated risk capital treatment for insurers' investments in environmentally sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>i. This allows insurers in Singapore to build their experience and capabilities in investing in sustainable infrastructure assets, and to gain deeper exposure to such assets.</p><p>ii. We will share more details of this pilot soon.</p><p>16. Taken together, these moves can potentially unlock Asia's sizable infrastructure investment gap, which is estimated at US$815 billion annually.[16]</p><p>Digital transition</p><p>17. I will touch on the digital transition next.</p><p>18. By 2030, the digital economy in the Asia-Pacific is expected to reach $2 trillion or more, driven by factors such as -</p><p>a. The boom in e-commerce, especially in countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam;</p><p>b. Innovations in fintech, especially digital payments; and</p><p>c. AI and cloud services, as businesses invest in these technologies to drive innovation.</p><p>19. At the same time, the risks associated with cyber threats will also increase. This will in turn drive the demand for the cyber insurance market in Asia.</p><p>a. The Asia-Pacific cyber insurance market is estimated to double from 2023 to 2027[17], as companies seek coverage for data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other cyber threats.</p><p>b. Reinsurers are developing more sophisticated cyber risk models to address this evolving threat.</p><p>i. For example, we have seen the industry develop dynamic cyber risk underwriting based on monitoring platforms making real-time risk assessments.</p><p>c. In tandem, I urge the industry to work with businesses and consumers to put in place robust cybersecurity measures.</p><p>i. Such ex-ante mitigation can help insurers better manage cyber risks, while encouraging businesses to adopt best-in-class systems and practices from the get-go.</p><p>Demographic transitions</p><p>20. Last but not least, the changing demographics in Asia - in particular, a combination of ageing populations, urbanisation, and increasing wealth - will fuel the demand for life and health reinsurance.</p><p>a. Many countries in Asia, such as China, Japan and South Korea, are experiencing rapidly aging populations. Singapore is no exception - we project to attain 'super-aged' status by 2026, with about one fifth of our population aged 65 years or older.</p><p>b. At the same time, life expectancy is expected to increase. This will drive demand for long-term healthcare, pensions and financial products that provide security in old age.</p><p>c. Likewise, the rise of the middle class in Asia, coupled with greater urbanisation, will fuel greater demand for life insurance, health insurance and savings-related products.</p><p>d. These trends will give rise to growing liabilities, and reinsurers can share the risk associated with longer lifespans and rising medical costs.</p><p>e. The rise of digital platforms and insurance technology - or InsurTech - will also increase the reach of insurers. This expansion in coverage will lead to a higher volume of complex risk, and therefore the opportunity for reinsurance to manage the risk portfolio.</p><p>f. Asia accounts for 39% of the global life market, and is expected to grow by over 5% annually over the next decade, outpacing the global average[18].</p><p>Growing Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub</p><p>21. I have outlined four transitions in Asia that will drive the demand for reinsurance - climate; energy; digital; and demographics.</p><p>22. Amidst this demand growth, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub.</p><p>23. First, we will double down on developing a marketplace of insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>a. Today, Singapore serves as the Asia-Pacific hub for 12 top global insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>b. Among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 reinsurers in the world have made Singapore their regional hub, covering not just ASEAN, but also markets in North and South Asia and even Australia.</p><p>c. We also have a well-developed network of about 150 brokers in Singapore today.</p><p>d. We encourage insurers to expand their presence in Singapore -</p><p>i. By leveraging our concentration of underwriting expertise here, including in complex property, casualty and specialty lines; and</p><p>ii. By building on the databases and models available, such as on climate change that I had spoken about earlier.</p><p>e. By strengthening our ecosystem of insurers, reinsurers and brokers, we can position Singapore as the hub for the development of risk financing solutions for Asia.</p><p>24. Second, we will work with insurers and reinsurers in Singapore to deepen their capabilities, in particular in AI.</p><p>a. There is good potential for the insurance industry to harness AI to improve productivity, customer service, and core operations including underwriting, actuarial analysis, and claims processing.</p><p>i. For example, it is estimated that generative AI can boost the insurance industry's revenues by 20% and cut their costs by 15%.[19]</p><p>b. To support the scaling of AI with confidence, Singapore is developing a strong foundation of AI governance that balances the need for innovation with the responsible use of AI.</p><p>i. In this regard, MAS is working in partnership with leading insurers here under Project MindForge to develop a risk framework for the responsible use of GenAI for insurance use cases, including in AI-assisted underwriting and customer engagement.</p><p>ii. MAS will also be issuing a set of good practices next year for addressing AI model, technology and cyber risks.</p><p>c. In tandem, we must build up our talent pool to harness the potential of AI.</p><p>i. MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance have commissioned a Jobs Transformation Map study on how GenAI will change job roles in the financial sector, and to identify the new skillsets needed. We will publish the findings and recommendations early next year.</p><p>d. I encourage the insurance industry to tap on the guidance and support available to develop and deepen your AI capabilities.</p><p>25. Third, we will continue to expand insurance capacity through alternative risk transfer instruments.</p><p>a. One such example is sovereign insurance solutions.</p><p>i. Singapore is part of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (or SEA-DRIF), an ASEAN+3 initiative in partnership with the World Bank to provide climate and disaster risk insurance solutions for the region.</p><p>ii. SEADRIF has made US$4.5 million in payouts to support flood response in Laos, including a US$3 million payout in September 2024 following Typhoon Yagi.</p><p>b. Another example is insurance-linked securities (ILS).</p><p>i. Singapore is supporting the development of ILS markets in Asia to unlock additional risk financing capacity for peak catastrophe risks.</p><p>1. Of the 28 catastrophe bond issuances[20] in Singapore over the past 5 years, 13 issuances have covered perils in Asia, providing US$1.6 billion in coverage.</p><p>2. Whilst this is a good start, Asia currently accounts for less than 5% of the global catastrophe bond market.</p><p>ii. With their strong credit rating, good in-country relationships and sovereign support programmes, multilateral development banks can bring scale to ILS issuances in Asia by partnering sovereigns on programmatic issuances.</p><p>1. For example, they can provide a ready platform from which to issue catastrophe bonds, offering faster time to market and cost savings compared to individual countries building issuance capabilities on their own.</p><p>iii. There is opportunity to channel some of the growing flow of investments from private wealth and institutional investors in Asia towards ILS - and to this end, MAS is partnering with the ILS industry to promote ILS as an asset class for private wealth and investment portfolios.</p><p>c. Through such alternative risk transfer instruments, we can unlock additional risk financing capacity, and complement that provided by traditional insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. Let me conclude. As Asia undergoes four fundamental transitions in the years ahead, there are opportunities for the reinsurance industry to play a key role in its growth and development, to insure a dynamic, sustainable and resilient Asia.</p><p>27. Through strengthening our insurance ecosystem, deepening capabilities, including in AI, and developing alternative risk transfer markets in Asia, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub.</p><p>28.

In front of him is a large interactive screen stretching across an entire wall of the room. With a few flicks, he pulls up a virtual 3D rendering of the area, zooms past a park, and enters an apartment. We're now \"standing\" in the apartment's balcony, where we can see exactly what the view from this soon-to-be-built tower will be like, down to the gently swaying treeline. As we take in the seaside panorama, the executive taps the screen again, and the room instantly glows orange from a simulated sunset.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The technology is astonishing. It's like that scene from Minority Report, where Tom Cruise uses the futuristic Precrime system to hunt down criminals (except here, we're chasing sunsets). Even more incredibly, if all goes according to plan, this experience is only a taste of what the development as a whole promises. </p><p> Lamda is the real-estate holding firm that Time named one of this year's 100 most influential companies. Credited for revitalising Greece, it runs four of Athens' biggest malls. But all that is dwarfed by the Ellinikon, Lamda's eight-billion-euro privately funded flagship development that is being built on the 6.2-million square-metre site where the former Ellinikon International Airport used to sit, along the sparkling Athenian Riviera.</p><p> This is Europe's largest urban regeneration project, a sustainably built and run \"smart\" city three times the size of Monaco that's breathing new life into an area famous for its Jackie Onassis-level glitz before the 2008 financial crisis hit. To be completed in three phases by 2035, it will encompass homes, offices and schools as well as sports, entertainment and cultural facilities across a master plan by global architects Foster + Partners, all of which will completely run on renewable energy sources, thanks to green infrastructure such as an underground power grid. It's also designed to give residents and visitors access to everything within a zippy 15 minutes, eliminating the need for cars.</p><p> The location is Hollywood-worthy: the Hydra head-shaped plot, 30 minutes from the capital's centre, hugs the Saronic Gulf on one side, while the limestone slopes of the Hymettus mountains loom behind. Blue skies and bluer waters illuminate the area, and ancient ruins, like the 6th-century-BC Temple of Apollo Zoster, dot the surroundings. In contrast, when the first roads and residential buildings are ready from next year, the Ellinikon will showcase some of the most advanced technology on the planet -- from sensors monitoring road traffic and seawater levels, to systems that manage waste collection, street lighting and parking spaces -- and serve as a global template for a city of the future. </p><p> \"One challenge other cities face is that they have an existing infrastructure which needs excavating, for sensors and other technology,\" says Lamda CEO Odisseas Athanasiou. \"Here, we have a unique opportunity to create the smart infrastructure from scratch. By building the roads, we could put in sensors, fibre optics and a 5G network to offer unprecedented levels of connectivity. Building from the ground up means we can collect data and incorporate sensors everywhere, from the light bulbs to underground infrastructure, collecting this data in a central platform and then addressing every need of residents and visitors from this master data centre.\"</p><p> Transforming lifestyle and locationIn a world of big dreams and even bigger fortunes, the construction of mind-bogglingly grandiose urban utopias -- think Saudi Arabia's Neom and the US' Telosa -- is no longer novel. But the Ellinikon stands out for being more, well, grounded. It's fully funded through its first phase of development, unlike others that have struggled with financing. And the massive project, which commenced work in June 2021, is quickly becoming reality, with the foundations of a vast state-of-the-art Sports Park laid this year, and the first tendrils of the Riviera Tower, the Mediterranean's tallest skyscraper at 50 floors, poking up close to the waterfront. Existing buildings, such as the Eero Saarinen-designed former airport terminal, which have been deemed to be environmentally kosher, are undergoing restoration to be repurposed in the new development.</p><p> Athanasiou says the project was created in consultation with the community, so public spaces abound. Its centrepiece is a coastal park, fertilised by compost and irrigated with cleaned sewage water, that will be one of the world's biggest when it opens next year. The tract will take up almost a third of the Ellinikon's area and double the green space in Athens, which has been dubbed a \"concrete capital\" for its lack of parks. With one million trees and 50 km of trails, it's perhaps the one thing locals are most looking forward to. Outside the park, an already complete Ellinikon Experience Centre houses community events such as music performances and film screenings, while by 2027, a 1 km-long public beach will open along the coastline. </p><p> Designs on the worldThose who want a slice of this future have plenty of big-name, Leed-certified residential options to choose from. The biophilic Riviera Tower, by Foster + Partners, takes indoors-outdoors design to a new level of luxury, with open-terrace living rooms that promise breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea. Next to the waterfront, Kengo Kuma's Marina Residences combine elegance with eco-friendly living (and a convenient spot next to the swish Riviera Galleria mall, which is also being designed by the storied Japanese architect). Meanwhile, the Little Athens neighbourhood to the west of the site will embrace local materials, and be home to a clutch of condos by both local and international practices. In total, about 8,000 units will be built, with prices starting from 6,000 euros per square metre. Many have already been sold, including all 170 units in the Riviera Tower.</p><p> Other offerings include what will be Southern Europe's largest and most modern mall by AEDAS, which will house 350 stores, a Hard Rock integrated casino and resort, and a Mandarin Oriental hotel and residences slated to launch in mid-2027. </p><p> Although completion of the entire development is some time away, the project's ambition and the promise of so many starchitect and brand names are already buoying holiday hotspots in the riviera. Last month, One &amp; Only officially opened its first resort in Greece along the same stretch, as did 91 Athens Riviera, a luxury glamping resort with a focus on wellness. Come summer, the hip Ace Hotel will set up camp in the riviera's Glyfada neighbourhood. </p><p> International influences, local love If certain aspects of the Ellinikon sound familiar, that's because the project drew inspiration from Singapore -- the Lion City was one of 17 case studies that Lamda and its consultants, McKinsey, studied in their research. </p><p> \"One of my biggest inspirations, not just for the Ellinikon, but in general, is Singapore,\" enthuses Athanasiou. \"I visited the city in 1999 and I was impressed how an island like this has become a world leader in so many things -- the green space, the creation of science and being a hub in transportation, financial services, culture and many others. After Lamda was appointed for the Ellinikon, I revisited Singapore, to see the Marina Bay development and specifically Marina Bay Sands. A truly successful global example.\" He highlights MBS as an example of the importance of having established names when it comes to the design of a development -- the Moshe Safdie landmark helped double the number of tourist arrivals in Singapore in eight years.</p><p> Still, it's clear that the Ellinikon's aspirations are very much focused on the wider world. \"Our vision is not to create real-estate projects and venues in buildings, but experiences that make people's lives better,\" explains the CEO. \"Sustainability is a fashionable word, but for us it is a very meaningful target that we are pursuing.\"</p><p> Sales pitch aside, the development is ultimately an ode to the resolute spirit of a country that has struggled for years, but is now finally poised to take off. \"Timing, probably for the first time in the last two decades, is in our favour,\" mulls Athanasiou. \"This is going to have a great effect on the way people perceive Greece. It cannot be measured in numbers today, but five years from now, it's going to be significant. This puts Greece on the map again -- for the right reasons this time.\"</p><p> The writer was a guest of Lamda Development</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["2-million square-metre site where the former Ellinikon International Airport used to sit, along the sparkling Athenian Riviera.

Technology is a powerful enabler. We speak to the experts about the opportunities in climate-related tech.Q: What is the opportunity set in climate tech for investors, and what types of innovation are most promising? Xiaying Zhang: We believe the market opportunity for mitigation- and adaptation-related climate solutions is enormous and necessary. While some individuals and companies may be willing to make trade-offs for more climate-friendly solutions, it is unlikely that society will accept trade-offs at the scale needed. </p><p>People are unlikely to stop travelling and consuming, and businesses are unlikely to stop producing. Regulation will be essential, but ultimately, solutions will need to be market-driven and stand on their own to be truly scalable.The range of investable climate solutions continues to broaden and expand. We continue to see declining costs and increased market adoption in areas such as renewables and electric vehicles (EVs), and this is likely to ramp up over time with ongoing scientific and technological innovation - for example, advances in solar materials and battery technology.Regarding adaptation, improved near-term weather and longer-term climate forecasting should help companies adjust their operations in real time to account for extreme weather events and to incorporate future climate risks into long-term asset planning. Parametric weather insurance is emerging as a way for businesses and consumers to hedge their revenue or asset risk around weather-related risks. Together, these combine into a wide range of potentially high-return, high-impact opportunities, particularly within growth-stage climate-tech companies.We also think several secular trends support disruptive climate-focused entrepreneurs. For example, as the list of countries and corporations committed to net-zero emissions grows, we expect high levels of global infrastructure spend, creating a foundation for innovative, asset-light companies to build on. In addition, consumers are demanding transparency and choices that match their climate-related values, and companies are in search of innovation that can help them meet that demand.In our view, this creates an enormous opportunity for innovations and technology that address climate change while delivering a superior user experience without trade-offs. We see all of this reflected in the growth of climate-related investments across public and private markets.Rachel Teo: Based on the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 report - which sets out a pathway for the global energy sector to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 - the investable opportunity until 2050 in the scenario where net zero is indeed achieved by mid-century is approximately US$126 trillion, or US$4.2 trillion a year over the next 30 years. However, even in a Stated Policies Scenario, as the IEA calls it, there is still significant momentum behind green solutions because of favourable conditions - such as existing and committed climate actions by governments, and the fall in climate change-related technology costs. The opportunity set for investors when it comes to technology solutions that aid the transition lies both within transition assets and green solutions providers. The former focuses on supporting high-carbon businesses that are credibly transitioning towards low-carbon business models, while the latter is about funding companies that are providing decarbonisation solutions for transitioning businesses and the economy at large. In both categories, the opportunity set for investors is broad - spanning public and private markets and across the full capital structure.Among six sectors that climate technologies can be categorised into (such as electricity, transport, buildings, industrial processes, low-emission fuels, and agriculture, forestry and other land use), electricity and transport represent the largest investment opportunities.Some technological solutions are already well established, such as solar and wind. But many are still nascent or early-stage, such as direct air capture (DAC), green hydrogen and nuclear fusion.While we do see many promising innovations, GIC's investment decisions are based on value creation and returns, including factors such as attractive risk-reward proposition and a good path to commercialisation. At GIC, we invest across both the entire technology spectrum and various stages of a company's growth because of our long-term orientation, flexible capital, and multi-asset portfolio. Our investments range from private equity (in technologies such as carbon capture or green steel) to infrastructure (in a company building EV charging infrastructure) to public equity (in an environmental, social and governance or ESG data provider), to debt financing (for companies working on geothermal energy solutions). This breadth allows us not only to invest in multiple innovative solutions, but also to support firms at various stages of development.Mathieu Forcioli: As a bank, we have a leading role to play in mobilising the transition to net zero by supporting our customers in their own transition to lower emissions. This involves helping companies access sustainable finance and expertise, and investing in climate solutions in collaboration with our partners and investors all over the world to scale up new technologies and approaches at pace.The global race to net zero presents an opportunity for investors, such as opening up new asset classes and products targeting, for example, technology and green infrastructure. At this stage, however, it is estimated that around half the technologies needed to meet the challenge are not yet commercially deployable and require rapid scaling-up. To date, the major focus in terms of decarbonisation has been low-carbon power generation, but we know this will not be enough to meet targets. Reducing emissions in the transport sector is another focal point, helping to drive substantial disruption in the auto and mobility industries from new competitors and technologies. Therefore, one pertinent theme for investors today is \"future transport\". The IEA estimates that 6 per cent of cumulative emission reductions in 2021-2050 could be achieved by using hydrogen-based fuels. Globally, government policy is driving both infrastructure development and vehicle transition via fuel standards, emission targets and incentives. Major vehicle manufacturers are accelerating their push to launch zero-carbon electric truck models, based both on battery and hydrogen fuel cell drivetrain technologies. And, more broadly, the convergence of mobility and technology underscores the structural importance of semiconductors and software. This is an exciting opportunity for investors. Cutting-edge, smart technologies and tech-based solutions can also help preserve nature, thereby indirectly contributing to net-zero emissions. We see many compelling examples of this, such as the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to convert food waste into insect-based animal feed, thereby helping reduce waste, carbon emissions and deforestation, and the use of agricultural methane detection technology to help cut emissions, reverse forest loss and regenerate biodiversity. In addition, the application of financial technology to the climate change challenge is bringing new investment solutions and opportunities to the VC space, which are all important in the transition towards net-zero emissions.Q: Venture capital is an avenue for investors to get exposure to climate tech. What are some of the challenges investors face when investing in climate tech'Zhang: The climate crisis represents a useful example whereby many venture-stage companies are developing new technologies, which may play a key role in helping every sector of the economy transform by reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency, and making global energy supply more sustainable. At the same time, investors should not overlook that investing in these more illiquid private companies comes with specific risks. Therefore, this is only appropriate for investors who can take a long-term approach, as exiting an investment in the event of financial or sustained underperformance may be difficult. Moreover, transparency and governance may be more limited compared to investments in publicly listed companies. Overall, some of these management teams may have less experience with public shareholder scrutiny and engagement than existing public companies.Investors need to ensure that the investee companies ultimately deliver real-world solutions in the fight against climate change - meaning the rigorous measurement of actual impact is critical when identifying and monitoring investments.However, impact measurement in private markets - particularly in VC - has specific considerations, including data availability and uncertainty, given that many of these companies are innovators and disrupters aiming to transform the industry. Further, if the investment thesis involves an innovative company with a new, first-to-market solution that is expected to be widely adopted, it is important to consider both the individual company and the potential ecosystem change.Teo: Given the early-stage nature of venture investing, there are many challenges for investors, particularly in evaluating the technology and the commercialisation risk.For some climate technologies, the solutions are still pre-commercialisation or scale-up. These require significant upfront capital and potentially years of research before any revenue is generated. In some cases, there may be significant asset management requirements to help company management teams develop business strategy, support growth, and monitor performance. For investors, the bar for domain expertise to be able to evaluate opportunities is thus very high.Additionally, business models may not be proven yet, and investors face significant uncertainties regarding the supporting ecosystem or infrastructure, including policies and regulations. The upshot, however, is that a climate tech startup which successfully achieves commercialisation is likely to have deeper competitive moats, making it tougher for competitors to replicate its products.Climate technology presents unique organisational challenges for investors. As climate technology covers a wide range of sectors and markets, investment teams require broad-based sector and regional experience. Furthermore, a long-term mindset is required to understand the full value of climate-tech solutions, as well as patience to support companies in their scaling-up. The climate-tech ecosystem is a quickly evolving one, with new companies having the potential to disrupt incumbents. Engaging early in this space in a considered and controlled manner allows GIC to understand the evolution of these promising technologies and better discern the winners. All investments, however, still carry risks. We look at these very carefully, put them through our stringent investment due diligence process, and subject them to risk controls which include starting with small investments and scaling up only when investments are sufficiently de-risked.Forcioli: By some estimates, over a quarter of all VC funding goes into climate technology, with strong growth over the last decade. Still, the amounts we are speaking about represent a fraction of total flows into private equity and VC, and fluctuate each year, which may impact the sustainability and growth of the climate-tech ecosystem. Thus, challenges remain along the road to fulfilling the climate objective. For example, while the long-term nature of private market investments lends itself to investing in technology, the illiquid nature of the investment and the uncertainty of cash flow generation later in life may suit a smaller pool of investors from a risk-return perspective. Factor in the time and risk involved in research and development - and, in many cases, a fund's lack of track record - and it is reasonable to see how this combination of longer time frames and unproven technology does not work for many VC investors, who typically want to see returns in five to seven years.On top of this, investors can find it challenging to monitor impact outcomes or assess the alignment of sustainability objectives to a portfolio company or fund manager due to a lack of benchmarks and data, which makes reporting and disclosure more difficult.But with challenges come opportunities. We see promising structural growth opportunities in clean energy and green technologies, including in innovations in solar, wind and hydrogen power, EVs, and green infrastructure such as flood walls which increase resilience of urban areas to natural disasters. Nature-based solutions in \"climate smart\" city planning can benefit city dwellers, reduce the carbon footprint and promote biological diversity.Q: In climate tech, how should impact be measured and tracked; and how do you set investor expectations for the likely outcomes'Zhang: We believe there are a few best practices that may help companies and investors navigate the unique challenges of measuring impact in this constantly evolving space. In setting investor expectations, there are four ways to authentically measure the progress companies create: Use existing wisdom to inform your approach. Generally accepted frameworks and principles in the industry include Impact Management Norms and Global Impact Investing Network's Iris+ system. Each provides a holistic view of impact and how best to derive key performance indicators (KPIs). Commit to assessing real-world impact with KPIs. Gathering regular data over the life of an investment speaks to actual outcomes. Ensure business model alignment. Considering that companies may have several different growth options, impact investing is potentially most powerful when there is strong alignment between the profit-seeking objectives and the ability to solve a pressing social or environmental problem. Do more than report the data. Data should be analysed and benchmarked over time to embed feedback. This helps to inform ongoing discussions with the company, as well as influence future investments in similar sectors. Teo: At a baseline level, tracking the financial performance and subjecting the company to the same standard of financial discipline as non-climate-tech companies are important and a key focus at GIC.Impact measurement is an evolving space and best practices are still developing. Some possible measures could include activity-based metrics, such as the amount of fossil fuel-powered energy usage the technology replaces (or has the potential to replace), or the amount of clean energy generated. We could also look to emissions-based metrics, including avoided emissions, which is something that GIC is evaluating. For solutions such as DAC, the relevant metric could be how much carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. Metrics could also be revenue-based, such as measuring the percentage of green revenues generated by the company based on globally accepted taxonomies.Forcioli: Investors are looking for a greater level of transparency in portfolio companies and a higher utility level from deployed capital. The measurement and tracking of impact largely depends on the level of disclosure from portfolio companies and the availability of data. In general, impact measurement can be conducted via quantitative assessment and mission-alignment measurement. For a quantitative assessment, a manager may employ a proprietary impact assessment tool to identify and assess ESG objectives, which are tracked using indicators such the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals or other climate-related science-based targets. For example, corporates may report active emission-reduction targets by years or Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.Alternatively, an investment manager may select bespoke KPIs for each investment to align mission and measurement. However, this approach may limit the ability to make comparisons across different investments, as the metrics can differ. With the rapid development of climate tech, investment managers have also evolved their own measurement methodologies with the help of sustainability consultancies and agencies, but industry standardisation remains a work in progress.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Mathieu Forcioli: As a bank, we have a leading role to play in mobilising the transition to net zero by supporting our customers in their own transition to lower emissions. This involves helping companies access sustainable finance and expertise, and investing in climate solutions in collaboration with our partners and investors all over the world to scale up new technologies and approaches at pace. At this stage, however, it is estimated that around half the technologies needed to meet the challenge are not yet commercially deployable and require rapid scaling-up. To date, the major focus in terms of decarbonisation has been low-carbon power generation, but we know this will not be enough to meet targets.", "On top of this, investors can find it challenging to monitor impact outcomes or assess the alignment of sustainability objectives to a portfolio company or fund manager due to a lack of benchmarks and data, which makes reporting and disclosure more difficult.

Contrary to all expectations, higher rates have brought sanity to the market, not a bloodbath. For fixed-income investors, that's a very good thing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Barring unforeseen events, it looks as if 2024 will finally end a dark era for global bond investors and the world economy -- a regime led by zero and even negative interest rate policies that forced investors and savers to take on uncomfortable amounts of risk. History will not look back favourably at this period and the many unintended consequences such policies brought. </p><p> The new regime, with rates higher but likely not rising any further, presents something of a Goldilocks scenario for fixed income. Finally, \"yield is destiny\". In other words, while we can always expect periods of volatility, long-term fixed-income investors should see elevated yields manifest as elevated returns, with little to fear from interest-rate risk eating away at their positions. </p><p> How should investors think about repositioning themselves for a big year in the fixed-income market'</p><p> One could say a big year for bonds has already happened in the last two months of 2023. Leveraged loans, investment-grade and corporates and high-yield issues -- which at times last year were great value -- look less attractive now, as much of the juice has already been squeezed out. But despite the rally, attractive values can still be had in a number of areas, with yield characteristics quite attractive overall. That's where individual security selection matters.</p><p> The commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market has been tainted by concerns around commercial real estate since the pandemic broke out. But ever since the global financial crisis, CMBS structures have tightened, with subordination reducing credit risk and providing investors with a quicker path to being repaid in the event of defaults. </p><p> While worries persist about the immediate future of office space in a world where many more people are working from home, the asset class is trading at an attractive discount and the worst predictions of lasting damage to the commercial market seem overblown. In general, there's value in high-quality structured products.</p><p> Financials are another area that stand to benefit from stable or falling rates in this new regime. While there was much hand wringing about the health of the banking system -- especially regional banks -- after Silicon Valley Bank's collapse in March 2023, deposit outflows have since stabilised. </p><p> Banks have been able to rebuild capital, and should soon see increased stability with Basel III Endgame, a new set of banking regulations, on the horizon. These new regulations would increase capital buffers for the biggest banks in the banking system and guard against the issues that caused the collapse of the US regionals.</p><p> There are also significant tailwinds for emerging markets (EM), which were first to raise rates in response to inflation and will likely be the first to cut. Favourable developments for EM include fierce competition between the US and China for hegemony in the global south; the movement of supply chains out of China and growing foreign direct investment in other EMs; and the rising demand for commodities like lithium and copper to build out new technologies and green infrastructure. </p><p> With inflation in EM countries falling faster than developed markets, the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle would greatly benefit EM growth as real rates remain positive. Of course, not all emerging markets are the same. Investors should look at countries such as Indonesia, India and Mexico that are growing rapidly and benefitting directly from the shift in supply chains.</p><p> Investors in European bonds may have more time to adjust to a new regime. </p><p> Recently, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde indicated Europe could see rate cuts in the summer. Europe will likely remain patient for lower inflation numbers and less buoyant profit margins. However, our base case assumes rates will be cut by 50 basis points by Q4 2024.</p><p> How much staying power this new regime of higher rates will have will be determined by the stickiness of inflation. Investors should watch the US labour market, where upward pressure on wages, particularly in the services sector, continues to be buoyed by low unemployment rates even as labour demand has eased. Geopolitical headwinds, such as the threat to shipping lanes in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, may strain supply chains and further elevate prices. These factors will likely keep the Fed from a dovish turn in the near term.</p><p> While a recession could necessitate rate cuts sooner than expected, we place the odds of a US recession at only 25 per cent. Self-inflicted wounds, however, such as a federal government shutdown, may change that calculus. Historically, for each week that the government is closed, current quarter real GDP contracts by 20 basis points on average. </p><p> In the big picture, however, rates hitting a plateau is the ideal time to invest in bonds. </p><p> Once the Fed and central banks across the globe start cutting rates, we should expect to see even more investors pare back on stocks and cash holdings, and return to more traditional portfolio allocations, which means a massive shift into bonds, and a subsequent fall in yields.</p><p> Investors who fail to lock in higher rates now may end up losing out in the long run.</p><p> The writer is co-chief investment officer, PGIM Fixed Income </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["These new regulations would increase capital buffers for the biggest banks in the banking system and guard against the issues that caused the collapse of the US regionals.

A very good evening to you. It is really my honour to be invited today to attend ACCA's 88th Anniversary Celebration Gala Dinner.</p><p>2. The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (or ACCA for short) is a prominent global professional accountancy body with a significant presence in Singapore, and I hear it is about 6,000 strong and growing.</p><p>3. Since establishing the Malaysia-Singapore branch in 1936, ACCA has been instrumental in supporting the Singapore accounting sector. The ACCA Qualification offers a solid foundation for aspiring accountants and is highly regarded by many employers in Singapore. When you heard from Daniel, I really meant it because I never could have predicted that I would make a speech on the 88th anniversary.</p><p>(a) ACCA has helped many Singaporeans achieve their professional accounting qualifications.</p><p>(b) Today, ACCA is a popular choice for those pursuing a career in accounting. Students recognise the quality and global portability of the ACCA qualification. That is very uniquely ACCA, to be recognised over 180 countries.</p><p>(c) Graduates go on to work in key sectors of the economy, advancing their careers in accounting and finance and contributing to the nation's economic growth.</p><p>4. I had the good fortune of meeting ACCA's members. I am really impressed by them. One person is of course Mr Amos Ng. He shared that he had a career of more than 40 years. He took the ACCA in the 1980s and that is his only professional qualification. Long story short, he is the Group CFO of a listed company. Not only that, he got himself elected in the Global Council. What he told me was that he had to be globally elected by 250,000 members of ACCA. I would like to know how he managed to get himself so popular to be elected by a big group of 250,000 people! Thanks for flying the Singapore flag. It is appreciated.</p><p>5. Another gentleman I met is Mr Nassir, a gentleman whose company was taking all the photographs for us. I have one in my pocket. Mr. Nassir, just like me, was a former police officer. He said ACCA changed his life. After ACCA, he became an entrepreneur. He also offered business solutions for his clients. He never looked back.</p><p>6. People like Mr Nassir and Mr Ng, are representatives of this family of ACCA members. So, shout out to each and every one of you!</p><p>7. Looking ahead, the accounting profession will continue to be pivotal in Singapore's economy, especially as we strengthen our position as a leading international financial hub and transition ourselves to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>Singapore as a Sustainable Finance Hub</p><p>8. In 2021, Singapore launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a national initiative to advance our sustainability goals. This positions us to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This is by no means a simple task.</p><p>9. Finance plays a critical role in enabling this transition, with McKinsey estimating that over US$3 trillion annually is needed in Asia to reach net-zero by 2050.</p><p>10. The public sector plans to issue up to S$35 billion of green bonds by 2030. However, government efforts alone cannot bridge the funding gap. We need to mobilise more capital from both public and private sources and increase investments in green and transition activities.</p><p>11. Despite significant financing needs, financing for transition and decarbonisation in Singapore remain low.</p><p>12. To address this, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Finance for Net Zero (FiNZ) (pronounced as FINS) Action Plan in April 2023. This plan outlines strategies to mobilise financing for Asia's transition to net-zero, expanding from green finance to transition finance, and it supports Singapore's vision to be the leading sustainable finance hub for Asia.</p><p>13. FiNZ has several priorities, including:</p><p>(a) Encouraging the development and use of innovative market solutions such as blended finance as well as green and sustainability-linked bonds and loans; and</p><p>(b) Enhancing definitions and disclosures to address greenwashing concerns through greater transparency.</p><p>14. Singapore has been developing the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (or FAST-P for short) with like-minded partners.</p><p>(a) It is a blended finance initiative under which we will work in collaboration with public, private and philanthropic sectors globally, including other sovereigns and multi-lateral development banks;</p><p>(b) FAST-P aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to finance green and transition projects in Asia; and</p><p>(c) This will grow the pipeline of regional projects that require additional financing and also expertise from the professional services sector. Accounts and financials form the basis of assessments for financiers, while legal contracts protect and build trust amongst stakeholders in developing green and transition projects.</p><p>15. Under FAST-P, MAS has entered into MOUs to set up an Energy Transition Acceleration Finance Partnership, which will support projects including the early phaseout of coal assets and their replacement with renewable energy, as well as a Green Investments Partnership to improve the bankability of green infrastructure projects in Asia.</p><p>16. Improving the consistency, comparability, and reliability of sustainability data and disclosures is also crucial.</p><p>17. First, Singapore will implement mandatory climate-related reporting in accordance with the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards published by the International Sustainability Standards Board (also known as the ISSB Standards), starting with listed companies in FY 2025 and large non-listed companies in FY 2027. Jurisdictions around the world are also looking to adopt or otherwise align with the ISSB standards, which are intended to act as a global framework for investor-focused sustainability reporting.</p><p>(a) We will need accountants with the skills and knowledge to understand how climate-related risks and opportunities impact a company's financials.</p><p>(b) Accountants will be instrumental in improving companies' sustainability data collection and information systems to capture the data necessary for such reporting.</p><p>(c) You will also play a key role in communicating these impacts in a fair and balanced manner.</p><p>18. Second, MAS launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance at COP28, the first to pioneer a 'transition' category. The taxonomy uses a traffic light system to define green and transition activities across eight sectors and will be aligned with global taxonomies for better interoperability.</p><p>19. As trusted business partners, accountants are uniquely positioned to drive sustainable growth and long-term value creation. Your expertise in reporting and assurance is pivotal in ensuring the credibility of both financial and sustainability-related information, thereby building trust with stakeholders. You can play a crucial role in navigating the complex landscape of ESG regulations and investor demands, ensuring accountability and transparency of your firm's performance towards sustainability.</p><p>20. Your role extends beyond reporting and compliance. By integrating sustainability considerations into financial analysis, you have a holistic view of your organisation, enabling the identification of critical sustainability risks, as well as opportunities. This provides invaluable insights for informed decision-making, ultimately driving positive change.</p><p>21. Support schemes are available to help companies build up capabilities in this area. For example:</p><p>(a) The Singapore Economic Development Board and Enterprise Singapore will launch a Sustainability Reporting Grant later this year to assist eligible Singapore-incorporated companies, especially those subject to upcoming mandatory reporting requirements, to produce their first sustainability report prepared in line with the ISSB standards.</p><p>(b) Additionally, companies can tap on Workforce Singapore's Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) for Accounting Professionals and Sustainability Professionals to develop these new competencies as well. Under the CCPs, companies can receive salary support of up to 6 months for new hires and up to 3 months for existing employees.</p><p>Singapore as a Hub for Sustainable Infrastructure</p><p>22. Singapore actively promotes and supports sustainable infrastructure both domestically and regionally.</p><p>23. Domestically, our strategic initiatives include:</p><p>(a) Green buildings such as the Green Mark Certification Scheme to ensure sustainable design, construction and operations in buildings; and</p><p>(b) Renewable energy integration such as the SolarNova programme which accelerates the deployment of solar panels across government buildings and public housing.</p><p>24. Regionally, we partner with international industry experts to champion sustainable infrastructure. This includes:</p><p>(a) The set up of a debt financing platform, Pentagreen Capital, to boost commercial development of sustainable infrastructure projects in Asia, with an initial focus in Southeast Asia. HSBC and Temasek are equity partners in the platform while the Asian Development Bank and Clifford Capital Holdings are strategic partners; and</p><p>(b) The formation of the Asia Sustainable Infrastructure Advisory Panel that brings together key industry leaders across various infrastructure sectors to share the latest thinking and promote private sector involvement in sustainable infrastructure across Asia.</p><p>25. Through these efforts, Singapore demonstrates its commitment to environmental stewardship and regional development.</p><p>26. Accountants can support these initiatives by integrating sustainability considerations when evaluating project viability, balancing the need for financial performance with sustainability. I encourage each of you to embrace your role in embedding sustainability into your organisations and contributing to a sustainable future for all.</p><p>Singapore's Commitment to Combatting Money Laundering</p><p>27. As Singapore advances as a financial and business hub, we must remain vigilant against financial crime. Singapore welcomes legitimate wealth, and high standards of regulation are key to our continued success as a trusted wealth management centre.</p><p>28. Financial crime is an ever-evolving threat. Increasing digitalisation has not just opened doors to legitimate growth, but also to risks of syndicated crimes such as scams, and misuse of complex structures to move and conceal illicit funds.</p><p>29. As professional gatekeepers, accountants like yourselves would be familiar with the importance of preventing and combatting money laundering.</p><p>(a) Last year's major money laundering case only underscores the importance of guarding against such crimes.</p><p>(b) Combatting such financial crimes is not a new requirement. Accountants involved in certain designated activities are already subjected to anti-money laundering requirements, such as conducting customer due diligence and reporting suspicious transactions.</p><p>30. Tackling money laundering requires a whole-of-society effort. We have implemented our anti-money laundering (or AML) rules using a risk-based approach to respond appropriately to risks and strengthened our AML regime across the Government, through public-private partnerships and international collaboration.</p><p>(a) There is close partnership between the public and private sectors. For instance, risk typologies and other information are shared between the authorities and the private sector through Singapore's AML and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Industry Partnership.</p><p>(b) Internationally, Singapore is an active member of the Financial Action Task Force or FATF for short. In fact, we just recently handed Singapore's FATF Presidency, occupied by Mr T. Raja Kumar, to Mexico in July 2024. The FATF is the global standards setter on AML, countering the financing of terrorism and countering proliferation financing rules. Through the FATF and other forums such as INTERPOL and the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, Singapore plays an active role to enhance cross-border collaboration.</p><p>31. In end-2023, the Singapore Government established an Inter-Ministerial Committee, headed by Minister Indranee Rajah, to further strengthen our AML regime. The Committee will share its full findings and recommendations in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>32. Singapore continuously reviews and takes risk-proportionate steps to enhance its financial system safeguards so as to remain a safe and trusted financial centre.</p><p>33. Accountants serve as the first line of defence against financial crimes such as money laundering.</p><p>(a) As accountants, your work brings you in close proximity to the world of business, which provides you with a keen business acumen and enables you to quickly pick up red flags in a business transaction.</p><p>(b) Even more importantly, you possess a strong sense of professionalism, ethics and integrity. If you suspect that something is amiss, you must ask more questions and if necessary, file a suspicious transaction report to the authorities.</p><p>(c) All of us must play our part to stay vigilant against the threat of financial crimes, to ensure that Singapore continues to be a trusted place to do business.</p><p>Conclusion: Safeguarding a Sustainable Future Together</p><p>34. On this momentous occasion, I want to acknowledge the significant contributions of accounting professionals to Singapore's robust economy.</p><p>35. Your dedication to financial integrity has been instrumental to our success. Not only that, I noted just now, that for ACCA, you have a very robust CSR contribution record as well. I met just now friends from Junior Achievement Singapore, who shared that many of their active members are drawn from ACCA Singapore. And what do they do? They help instil in our primary school children, financial literacy. This is really heartwarming.</p><p>36.

This marks a change from the current eight, which include advanced manufacturing, cybersecurity, and data analytics.Three of the categories - digital economy, care economy and green economy - were identified in last year's inaugural SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) Skills Demand for the Future Economy Report as growth areas with increasing opportunities for Singaporeans.The curated SkillsFuture Series is an example of how SSG is working with institutes of higher learning and private training providers to launch new quality courses to address the skills needs in these high growth areas, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday (Nov 22) at SkillsFuture Fellowships and SkillsFuture Employer Awards Ceremony.The second edition of the report was launched during the ceremony. It takes a deeper look at the \"priority skills\" needed in the three areas, rating them on two aspects: how much demand has grown since the pre-pandemic year of 2018, and whether they are transferable across different jobs and industries. Workers can use the report to assess which skills they already have, and what skills they could seek to gain to become more employable, said SSG in a release. </p><p>The report is a result of SSG's work with workforce analytics firms to draw data from job portals and talent networks to identify new and emerging skills, said Chan. In the green economy, for instance, demand has grown the most for skills in green infrastructure and mobility - rising almost 200 per cent between 2018 and 2021 - as well as in energy, resource circularity and decarbonisation.Examples of skills needed in green infrastructure and mobility include green facilities management, which might be needed by a building supervisor; electric vehicle and hybrid vehicle maintenance management, for an automotive technician; and climate-mitigating features in the built environment, for an architectural associate.There is also growing demand for skills in sustainable finance, urban farming, food technologies and food development.Highly transferable skills include those in environment and sustainability management, required in more than 400 roles across areas such as business development, engineering project development and facilities management.In the digital economy, software development skills have the highest demand growth of 83 per cent between 2018 and 2021, as well as high transferability. These include software testing, user experience design and software design, for job roles such as software engineer, product designer and quality assurance tester.In the future, more job roles will also require skills in e-commerce and digital marketing - such as customer experience management - as well as in artificial intelligence, data and analytics.For the care economy, human resource advisory and career coaching were found to have both high demand growth and transferability.This year's report also looks at potential upskilling and career options for mid-career Singapore workers in their 40s and 50s, based on their existing work experience and expertise. \"We are keen to support them in job switches within the same sector or across sectors by highlighting possible upskilling pathways and available resources,\" said Chan.For example, they could take up new skills to enter jobs in the three high-growth economies; reskill for opportunities in roles adjacent to their current one; or upskill to stay relevant in their current role, he added.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Workers can use the report to assess which skills they already have, and what skills they could seek to gain to become more employable, said SSG in a release.

He was referring to the fragmentation of an area or region into multiple smaller and hostile units.</p><p> Ms Joanne Lin from the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute said that Indonesia deserves credit for its efforts because it made attempts to ensure Asean gets a say in such high-profile conflicts.</p><p> \"Although some of these international conflicts like the war in Ukraine and Gaza are beyond Asean's ability to resolve, Indonesia did its part to allow Asean's voice to be heard by issuing timely statements,\" said Ms Lin, who is a co-coordinator of the Asean Studies Centre at the institute.</p><p> She highlighted how Indonesia managed to help Asean forge some level of consensus and a common position regarding the Israel-Hamas war. The bloc's leaders and the Gulf Cooperation Council had condemned all attacks against civilians and called for a durable ceasefire on Oct 20, less than two weeks after the conflict started.</p><p> Nevertheless, there were some low moments. </p><p> Talk of fragmentation intensified in July during the Asean Foreign Ministers' Meeting, when the Myanmar crisis laid bare the divisions among the bloc's ranks.</p><p>Thailand's then Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai revealed he had met Myanmar's ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who he said urged engagement with Myanmar's military junta to resolve the crisis sparked by a military coup in February 2021. </p><p> This meeting on July 9 took place less than a month after he had invited his Asean counterparts to a meeting to re-engage with Myanmar's military on June 19. Besides Myanmar and host Thailand, only Laos turned up with its top diplomat, while others sent junior representatives or did not attend.</p><p> This was a departure from Asean's position, which is to avoid recognising the Myanmar military officially and allowing the country to only be represented by a non-political representative at its meetings, until there is progress in implementing established peace plans the country made with the bloc. </p><p> Quelling any doubts about its unity, in September, the bloc closed ranks and said it would review the implementation of  peace plans, as well as set up an informal \"troika\" approach to its special envoy on Myanmar, where the presiding chairman will be supported by the immediate past and incoming chairs.</p><p> Asean does not have full control over issues like Myanmar, given how it must work with other stakeholders to address this issue, but some progress has been made, said Mr Ng.</p><p>Indonesia has, over the course of the year, given updates about meetings it has had with different groups in Myanmar, but critics point out that it is not clear what the meetings have been about.</p><p> \"While Indonesia has claimed that it conducted more than 180 engagements with stakeholders in Myanmar, the details of those meetings were not disclosed, and no one knows who these stakeholders are,\" said Ms Lin.

This means that one out of every six tonnes of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere comes from a coal plant in Asia.</p><p>* If these coal plants are left to operate as planned, they will exhaust about two-thirds of the carbon budget that we have remaining to keep the rise in global temperatures to within 1.5 degree Celsius.</p><p>* But these coal plants account for nearly 60% of power generation in Asia, where energy demand is expected to increase by two-and-a-half times by 2050.</p><p>The economics of energy transition in Asia are challenging.</p><p>* Coal plants in Asia are young, at less than 15 years old on average. They are backed by long-term power purchase agreements and policy reliefs.</p><p>* There are some 6.7 million people employed across the coal value chain in Asia. We need to ensure that jobs and communities are cushioned through the transition.</p><p>* While there is growing renewable energy investment, it is insufficient to replace fossil fuel energy and meet growing energy demand.</p><p>* More investment is needed in energy storage and grid infrastructure to deal with the variability of renewable energy and lower its cost.</p><p>Asia's energy transition can only be achieved by adopting an ecosystem approach. We need four key components:</p><p>* policy commitment</p><p>* transition pathways</p><p>* blended finance</p><p>* transition credits</p><p>First, policy commitment to the energy transition, to foster investor confidence. This includes three things:</p><p>* carbon pricing through the use of carbon taxes or emissions cap-and-trade systems;</p><p>* granular energy sector targets, including interim milestones; and</p><p>* supportive policies for electrification in carbon-intensive sectors such as transport, industry, and buildings.</p><p>Second, credible pathways for energy transition customised for Asia.</p><p>* We need standard setters like the International Energy Agency (IEA) to produce pathways for the energy sector contextualised for Asia.</p><p>* These pathways enable the development of credible, phase-out plans aligned with a 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway.</p><p>Transition pathways should be complemented by taxonomies, practical guidance, and supervisory expectations.</p><p>Take for example the managed phase-out of coal.</p><p>* Taxonomies . The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has released a transition focused taxonomy which sets out detailed thresholds and criteria for the managed phaseout of coal.</p><p>* Practical Guidance . The GFANZ Asia Pacific Network has launched practical guidance for financial institutions to assess and support the financing of coal phaseout transactions.</p><p>* Supervisory Expectations . MAS' proposed guidelines on transition planning recognise that financial institutions may see a short-term increase in their financed emissions when they finance transition projects.</p><p>Third, blended finance to reduce the cost of capital for managed coal phaseout and renewable energy development.</p><p>* An estimated US$29 trillion is needed to end coal globally and replace it with renewables, with nearly half of this needed in Asia.</p><p>* Blended finance is critical in achieving Asia's energy transition. It reduces the cost of capital for energy transition projects in two ways:</p><p> One, it leverages on concessional capital from the public and philanthropic sectors to crowd in multiples of private commercial capital.</p><p>Two, it brings together technical assistance and institutional support to reduce project risk.</p><p>* But blended finance needs to move from bespoke deal-by-deal structuring to a portfolio or platform approach.</p><p>Singapore is establishing a blended finance platform called Financing Asia's Transition Partnership or \"FAST-P\".</p><p>* FAST-P aims to raise up to US$5 billion for green and transition infrastructure in Asia. Singapore is prepared to contribute concessional capital alongside other partners to crowd in commercial capital.</p><p>* We strongly encourage global and regional providers of concessional and commercial capital providers to join us in this partnership.</p><p>MAS is partnering the ADB and GEAPP as part of FAST-P to accelerate energy transition in Asia.</p><p>* The collaboration with the ADB and GEAPP aims to mobilise concessional capital globally, and crowd in private capital to de-risk and finance transition projects.</p><p>* It is focused on the early phaseout of coal and replacement with renewable energy, and the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors such as cement and steel manufacturing.</p><p>Fourth, transition credits to enhance the economic viability of transition projects.</p><p>* The MAS-ADB-GEAPP partnership will test the use of credible transition credits to enhance the economic viability of coal phase-out transactions.</p><p>* I am pleased to share that ADB and MAS will be exploring how transition credits can be used for the retirement of a coal plant in Mindanao under the ADB's Energy Transition Mechanism in the Philippines.</p><p>Let me conclude.</p><p>Asia's energy transition is not easy. But it is essential if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate change.

A very good evening to you.</p><p>2. Let us first congratulate the organisers on a successful ASEAN-China-India Youth Leadership Summit, and also the winning teams of the Sustainability Startathon.</p><p>3. We all know the world faces unprecedented challenges stemming from climate change and environment degradation.</p><p>a. Global temperatures are rising, which have a knock-on effect on rising sea levels and disruption in ecosystems. According to NASA, the summer of 2023 was Earth's hottest since global records began in 1880.</p><p>b. As a small island like Singapore, we are not spared either. Singapore has been planning 20, 30, 40 years ahead, to look at how we can prepare ourselves for rising sea levels and rising temperatures.</p><p>c. In the longer term, climate change also threatens food security, water resources and human health.</p><p>4. The solution to these pressing environmental issues lies at the intersection of innovation in sustainability, global collaboration, and of course youths as agents of change.</p><p>Innovation in Sustainability</p><p>5. First, innovation in sustainability allows us to find ways to meet the needs of the current generation without compromising the needs of future generations. Let me give you some examples.</p><p>a. Innovations in material science can boost waste reduction in areas such as packaging. For example, students from the National University of Singapore (NUS)'s School of Materials Science &amp; Engineering developed a biodegradable alginate bioplastic. I hear that it is a sustainable and potentially viable alternative for single-use plastic.</p><p>b. The transition to renewable energy is another area where innovation is needed to bring together different technologies and create new solutions. Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and Yinson Greentech launched green infrastructure on campus comprising an IoT-enabled smart energy management technology centre, a solar farm and electric charging facilities powered by renewable energy.</p><p>c. Third, sustainable architecture is gearing up with green building designs and construction methods which will reduce energy consumption. The Nanyang Technological University (NTU) launched Gaia, the largest wooden building in Asia this year. It is also the eighth zero energy building on the campus grounds out of 16 certified zero energy buildings in Singapore.</p><p>6. There have been many other innovations in green transportation, sustainable agriculture and the circular economy. But sustainability innovation is not without challenges. It requires collaboration, investment, and a willingness to embrace change. This collaboration also needs to go across global boundaries, bringing the best talents and ideas together to solve sustainability problems.</p><p>Global Collaboration for a More Sustainable Future</p><p>7. Singapore, as a small country, is doing its part in making a sustainable living in an urban environment a reality.</p><p>a. Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we hope to have a green citizenry that consumes and wastes less, greener commutes and are also strengthening green efforts in our schools.</p><p>8. However, Singapore cannot work on a sustainable future alone, as many of our environmental challenges cut across national borders.</p><p>a. Pollution in one country, for example, can affect countries thousands of kilometers away.</p><p>b. Effective solutions will require the collective will and knowledge of nations.</p><p>c. And collaboration with peers from difference countries bring diverse perspectives and ideas to create better solutions.</p><p>9. This is why each team for the grand finals of the Sustainability Starthaton comprised members from different countries including China, India, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.</p><p>10. I hope that this Summit has enabled you to forge a better understanding and closer ties with your counterparts from ASEAN, China and India. And I hope that you will find this friendship and understanding across borders, to be a vital asset as you negotiate the complex strategic relations between nations in the future and as you enter the working world yourselves.</p><p>Youths as Agents of Change</p><p>11. Being part of this Summit, your physical and virtual presence shows that you are deeply invested in the health of our planet. You have a long-term stake in our future.</p><p>12. Your generation is well positioned to drive change.</p><p>a. For the youths, I hope you look at problems with new eyes, bringing fresh perspectives to solve problems not just today, but for the future. Having grown up in the digital era, you are well-placed to harness the powers of technology in coming up with sustainable solutions.</p><p>13. Beyond this Summit, continue to advance your sustainability endeavours in your respective countries. There are various ways you can do so:</p><p>a. First, just like the Sustainability Forum you attended this Summit, speak to more industry experts and thought leaders on how they craft liveable sustainable solutions.</p><p>b. Second, continue to seek out local and international sustainability-related programmes. For our Singaporean youth, I invite you to join the Youth for Environmental Sustainability (YES) Leaders Programme that was recently launched by the National Environment Agency (NEA), to champion sustainability on-campus in Singapore. If you have good ideas for projects that can involve the community to advance environmental sustainability, you can also apply for the SG Eco Fund by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE).</p><p>c. Last but not least, put the tools and knowledge that you have picked up from this Summit to good use, such as starting a sustainability initiative or building a career in sustainability. You can be the amplifier and spread the cause amongst your community.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>14. Finally to the youths, I hope you will always remember: your actions today matter and can make a difference in the future.</p><p>15. With the energy, idealism and collaborative spirit of our youth, the solution to our pressing environmental challenges lies with you as our agents of change.</p><p>16. All the best to our youth.

Headwinds arising from the energy crisis and higher interest rates have generally slowed global capital market and financing activity. Despite a slowdown in global green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bond issuance in 1Q 2022, volumes have started to rebound in 2Q. Moody's expects a 24% increase in global GSSS bond volumes in 2H 2022 compared to 1H 2022.</p><p>2. In Singapore, we continue to see strong interest and growth in green and sustainable financing. From 2017 to 2021, over S$65 billion of GSSS bonds and loans were issued here. Singapore-based financial institutions continue to see strong demand for GSSS bonds and loans. PUB recently raised S$800 million through its inaugural green bond issuance. We have also seen issuances from corporates such as Singtel and Ascott Residence Trust this year.

This will help grow our green bond market and deepen market liquidity for private sector green bond issuers.</p><p>6. Third, MAS will promote the scaling of blended finance to mitigate risk for investors and spur flows into marginally bankable but worthy transition projects in the region.</p><p>7. Fourth, MAS is putting in place underlying enablers to support the growth of green and sustainable finance. These include (i) working with industry players to develop a taxonomy to help financial institutions in Singapore classify activities as environmentally sustainable, harmful, or in transition, (ii) working with SGX to strengthen the comparability and reliability of sustainability-related disclosures for listed companies, major financial institutions and retail ESG funds, and (iii) using technology to enhance investors' access to trusted and high-quality ESG data for decision-making.</p><p>[Category: Banking &amp; Finance, ESG, Funding Activities]</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["First, MAS' Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme (SBGS) and Green and Sustainability-Linked Loan Grant Scheme (GSLS) have helped to defray the additional costs incurred by corporates when they conduct external reviews aligned with internationally-recognised sustainability principles. 5.

The consensus calls for a dialogue among all parties, an immediate halt to violence in Myanmar, the appointment of an Asean special envoy to facilitate mediation, humanitarian assistance, and a visit by an Asean delegation to Myanmar to meet all concerned parties.</p><p> However, unlike previous occasions, they had mentioned the country's armed forces \"in particular\" have to end hostilities.</p><p> They also agreed to have the Philippines replace Myanmar as Asean chair in 2026 under an annual rotating system among the 10 member states in alphabetical order. This rotation arrangement will not change until a decision is made to do so.</p><p> Another notable outcome is an informal \"troika\" approach to Asean's special envoy on Myanmar, where the presiding Asean chairman will be supported by the immediate past and incoming chairs for continuity, given that the situation in Myanmar is unlikely to change in a one-year timeframe. </p><p> This means 2024's chair Laos will have to coordinate with Indonesia as well as Malaysia, which is 2025's chair.</p><p> Dr Lina Alexandra, who heads the Department of International Relations at Jakarta's Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said the stronger statements by the grouping demonstrated its solidarity and should be appreciated.</p><p> She also lauded the 145 engagements with various stakeholders in Myanmar that Indonesia carried out during its chairmanship -- which previous chairs had not done. </p><p> The question now lies in how these efforts will translate into a concrete plan for implementation with effective outcomes, said Dr Lina. \"All these should be appreciated as a starting point, good initiatives that have accommodated a lot of concerns from Myanmar observers. </p><p> \"But it is just the beginning. Will this be a basis to constitutionalise the Office of Special Envoy... Will there be a road map or an implementation plan? There must be concrete work and results, not just a mechanism,\" she said.</p><p> Ms Lin noted that the troika arrangement will allow Laos to gain insights from Indonesia which will then be passed on to Malaysia. </p><p> Sharing experiences on engagements with the military government and other stakeholders in Myanmar will ensure that new chairs are equipped to take on the task of tackling the crisis, she said.</p><p> \"It is important that each new chair does not pursue its own initiatives in a siloed manner, otherwise Asean will not be seen as being a credible and united grouping,\" she added.</p><p> Besides the Myanmar crisis, Asean is currently working on negotiating the code of conduct (COC), a legally binding rule book to govern the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest waterways that is also the site of overlapping claims by China, Taiwan and four Asean states -- Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. </p><p> On Aug 28, about a week before the Asean Summit, China sprang a fresh surprise by releasing a new standard map claiming sovereignty in an even bigger area, which includes the waters off South-east Asian nations' coasts as well as part of the north-east of India.</p><p> While the claim triggered objections from India, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam, Asean had been muted on the issue. </p><p> \"It is really difficult to understand China's move regarding the map shortly before the Asean and Asean-related summits,\" Dr Rizal Sukma, a CSIS senior fellow, told ST.</p><p> \"The move clearly does not contribute to the conducive condition for productive COC negotiation. So the COC negotiation is going to be even tougher down the road,\" he added.</p><p> China and Asean have been each other's top trading partners in the last three years, and proximity to China and fast-growing economies in South-east Asia have made the region one of the top destinations for Chinese aid and investment in infrastructure through the Belt and Road Initiative, among other things.</p><p> Dr Rizal noted that Asean as a collective entity \"is getting weak vis-a-vis China\", adding: \"Worse, I am not sure if Asean has a collective view on how to respond to this problem.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced today that it will set supervisory expectations to steer financial institutions' transition planning processes to facilitate credible decarbonisation efforts by their clients.</p><p>2. Speaking at the Financing Asia's Transition (FAST) Conference, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies, and Chairman of MAS, underscored the need for financial supervisors to incentivise financial institutions and their customers to bring forward their actions to support longer term climate-positive outcomes.</p><p>3. The guidance on transition planning will cover financial institutions' governance frameworks and client engagement processes to manage climate-related financial risks and enable transition in the real economy towards net-zero. Financial institutions should not indiscriminately de-risk from particular sectors, but instead carefully assess clients' transition plans and provide the needed financing for transition where the plans are credible. In reviewing financial institutions' implementation of transition plans, MAS will recognise that a short-term increase in their financed emissions may arise due to actions supporting longer term climate positive outcomes. MAS will issue a consultation paper later this year.</p><p>4. As announced by Mr Shanmugaratnam in his speech, MAS and other government agencies are collaborating with industry players to explore platforms to channel blended finance at scale into transition and green infrastructure projects in the region. MAS aims to bring together patient, concessionary capital from philanthropies, multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, and donor partners. This will in turn help to crowd in more conventional infrastructure financiers, including banks, and institutional investors. Details will be announced when the plans are more developed.</p><p>5. Building on the strong achievements of the Green Finance Industry Taskforce [1], MAS together with the financial industry will establish the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA) to build a vibrant ecosystem for green and transition finance. The SSFA will initially focus on initiatives to scale voluntary carbon markets, transition finance, and blended finance. The SSFA will include representatives from financial institutions, financial industry associations, relevant corporates and service providers such as ESG rating agencies. The Association of Banks in Singapore is leading the coordination and setting up of the SSFA.</p><p>6. Jointly organised by MAS, BlackRock and Temasek, the FAST Conference brought together key decision-makers across financial institutions and the real economy to catalyse green and transition finance. Speakers and panellists discussed opportunities in climate financing, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies; building net-zero portfolios; developing a trusted global carbon market; phasing out Asia's coal-fired power plants and leveraging philanthropic capital.</p><p>7. MAS also launched a series of Finance for Net Zero (FiNZ) Connect roundtables and workshops to facilitate sectoral deep dive discussions and the development of financing solutions relevant to Asia. The series, held throughout the year, aims to complement the FAST Conference and enable greater opportunities for collaboration across the ecosystem. Roundtables held earlier in the year as part of this series included discussions on strategies to achieve Singapore's 2050 net zero goal and the decarbonisation of the maritime sector.</p><p>8. MAS partnered with BlackRock, Convergence, Global-Asia Insurance Partnership (GAIP), and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) Asia Pacific Network to organise four FiNZ Connect roundtables after the FAST Conference. The roundtables discussed financing solutions for the maritime sector's decarbonisation; the managed phase out of coal; and examined the role of insurers and philanthropies in scaling blended finance to mobilise capital for the transition.</p><p>9. The FAST Conference, together with the FiNZ Connect series, was co-hosted by MAS as part of Ecosperity Week 2023, with a focus on the nexus between the broader economy and the role of sustainable finance in facilitating the net zero transition. The events collectively underscore the urgent need for the public, private and philanthropic sectors to work synergistically to mobilise capital and drive concrete and practical financing solutions in Asia.</p><p>Footnote:</p><p>[1] The Green Finance Industry Taskforce was convened by the MAS in 2019 to help accelerate the development of green finance through four key initiatives including developing a taxonomy and enhancing environmental risk management practices of financial institutions.

The number registered has more than doubled from 16,000 in 2020 to 37,320 as at end-June. But the spike has also brought problems -- a rise in road accidents involving e-bikes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There were 157 accidents involving e-bikes in 2022, a slight rise from 150 in 2021 but doubling from 78 in 2020. Eight were fatal, and in August 2023, a 64-year-old e-bike rider died after being hit by a minibus in Hougang.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Motorised devices have speed limit restrictions, are banned from footpaths, and theory tests are mandatory to ride them on roads. Notices were issued by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to more than 5,000 e-bike users in 2022 for riding on footpaths.</p><p> Despite the regulations and active enforcement, e-bikes on roads still pose risks. Much of this stems from the tension between motorists and e-bike users.</p><p> In a report from The Straits Times that examined this, a seasoned e-bike user from Norway, who continued his practice in Singapore after he moved here, candidly said it was not for the faint of heart. He emphasised the need for drivers to treat bikers with more respect. Irate drivers have also expressed frustration at e-bike riders flouting traffic rules and norms, and riding dangerously.</p><p> The friction between the two modes of transport has been observed in other countries, even in contexts where traditional bicycles have long been part of daily life, such as in the Netherlands.</p><p> These experiences show that regulation, education and appropriate infrastructure are key to ensure that e-bikes can be well integrated to the fabric of cities as a sustainable mode of transportation.</p><p> This is important, as clearly e-bikes are here to stay: A large part of the rise of e-bikes has been their popularity with food delivery drivers, as they are cheaper to own and run than motorbikes. E-bikes are also popular with commuters who want to avoid crowded public transport or bridge the last-mile connection between transport hubs and home.</p><p>Singapore is already well primed for e-bikes due to its mostly flat landscape and excellent connectivity, so we should start considering making the city more conducive and safe for them. A bonus is that addressing these concerns can offer an opportunity to achieve other goals, as e-bikes can be part of a transition to a healthier and greener model of urbanisation.</p><p> Helping e-bikes have  their rightful placeBehavioural change and careful planning are needed to safely integrate e-bikes into existing transport networks. If we can overcome these barriers, e-bikes can help us reduce our long-held dependence on cars and motorcycles, alongside expanding and improving the public transport system.</p><p> Promoting a culture of mutual respect between car drivers and e-bike riders necessitates a comprehensive approach focused on heightened awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. For car drivers, a deepened understanding of the presence and rights of e-bike riders is imperative, facilitating a significant enhancement in shared road safety. Concurrently, e-bike enthusiasts should be equipped with a solid grounding in road etiquette, adherence to traffic regulations and safety protocols to ensure a more harmonious coexistence with other motorists.</p><p> Beyond changing attitudes and enforcing laws, there's a need for infrastructure. </p><p> Dedicated cycling lanes are necessary to keep both pedestrians and electric or pedal-powered riders safe. These could also provide alternative routes for riders who would otherwise travel on roads. They also take up far less space than multi-lane roads, freeing up much-needed land for green space. </p><p> It's worth noting that LTA is studying the feasibility of removing street-side parking to make way for cycling paths in some roads and has identified 60 sites to be converted into paths for pedestrians and cyclists. In its latest announcement in September on expanding Singapore's cycling connectivity, LTA called a tender to build 34.4km of new cycling paths in western and central Singapore. </p><p> But Singapore could take a stronger grip of the wheel in paving the path for green areas that are e-bike inclusive. In an earlier piece for ST in July that focused on nature-based solutions, I put stress on how Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and other Asean countries were struggling to find space for green infrastructure, including green roofs, parks and community gardens. Serving as an example to the region, Singapore can lead the way by making space for green areas integrated into cycling infrastructure.</p><p> Additionally, the potential benefits for our health are many, and it would help change mindsets to be more inclusive of e-bikes if people were more aware of this. Fewer cars and motorcycles on the road mean less air pollution. Expanding green spaces provides opportunities for recreation and physical activity, as well as having positive benefits for our mental health. Integrating green space across the city is also essential to conserve our precious biodiversity.</p><p> Reducing dependency on carsIn many ways, Singapore is the perfect city for e-bikes -- compact, well-connected and mostly flat. But, like most cities around the world, the Republic has an in-built dependency on cars. According to LTA, Singapore has 9,500km of roads, taking up a whopping 12 per cent of the total land area.</p><p> As we reduce our dependence on cars as part of the vision for a car-lite city, the expansion of the cycling network to accommodate e-bikes could lead to a win-win situation. Along with reducing air and noise pollution, e-bikes can lead to a city with fewer cars, which could free up valuable space from unnecessary roads and carparks in the long term.</p><p> They also are cheaper and offer greater flexibility in getting around -- especially with the expansion of cycling paths and park connectors.</p><p> Green benefits of  accepting e-bikesTransitioning to new forms of transport, including e-bikes, is a key step to rethink how we use our city and build a greener future. Around the world, we are seeing cities move from traditional grey infrastructure to greener alternatives.</p><p> The city of Sheffield in Britain, for example, is converting redundant roads into green spaces to reduce flood risk. The project, known as \"Grey to Green\", has reimagined an inner-city highway -- converting two lanes of the road into rain gardens and cycling lanes. The new green belt was integrated into the cycling network and also serves as a flood protection system by collecting excess rainwater.</p><p> Replacing roads and concrete carparks with cycling lanes and green spaces is also a key strategy to reduce the urban heat island effect. Due to their dark colour and impermeable surface, asphalt roads are good at holding heat. As Singapore feels the effects of a warming climate, reducing urban heat and providing cool spaces throughout the city will be essential to prevent heat stress. </p><p> Indeed, following Singapore's landmark vision of a City in Nature, the adoption of green cycling lanes could be the next step in a strategy to bring more green to the country.</p><p> It will take some careful urban planning, and a shift in the way we think, but e-bikes have the potential to play an important part in changing the way we use our city -- for the better.</p><p> Erich Wolff is a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University's Earth Observatory of Singapore. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["4km of new cycling paths in western and central Singapore.

The Forum provides an invaluable opportunity for us to share insights and reflections, and it is good to see many representatives from across the alternatives asset management sector who are present here today.</p><p>This year is truly special as it marks the 20th anniversary of AIMA in Singapore and this is also the 10th edition of the annual forum held here. I would like to congratulate AIMA on this significant milestone. It has been remarkable to see AIMA's membership in Singapore grow from strength to strength since AIMA was first set up in 2004. I understand that you now have a membership base of over 200 member firms.</p><p>AIMA's deep commitment to grow the industry and keep your members updated on key developments is evident from the number of AIMA events organised in Singapore, which has almost doubled since before COVID.

Geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions due to on-going wars, inflation risks, higher for longer interest rates as well as cost pressures have caused uncertainty to the financial markets.</p><p>That said, global financial markets confounded gloomy expectations last year, rebounding from a challenging year in 2022. Global equities rallied by more than 22% in 2023. [1] Notably, the US S&amp;P 500 Index gained over 24%, notching up a record high. [2] The US stock market rally was impressive but lopsided, led by the \"Magnificent Seven\" [3] and fueled by strong anticipated growth in the AI space. Global bonds also reversed heavy losses made early in the year, as recession fears were replaced by growing confidence that the US would achieve an economic soft landing. [4]</p><p>As we move into 2024, while macroeconomic headwinds have not fully subsided and the asset management industry continues to face cost pressures and increased competition, the market is turning cautiously optimistic. Global inflation appears to have eased from its highest level and progress is underway to bring inflation down to target. [5] Zooming in, Asia remains a highly dynamic region, with a projected growth rate of 4.5% in 2024, contributing to two-thirds of global growth for the year. [6] Barring any further shocks, the Singapore economy is expected to strengthen in 2024, with growth becoming more broad-based. [7]</p><p>Bright Spots in the Alternatives Sector</p><p>Within the asset management industry, the global alternatives sector remains resilient. Despite a turbulent year for hedge funds given investor outflows, its AUM has continued to grow, reaching a record high of approximately US$4.4 trillion at the end of the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 4.6% from 2022. Asset performance and returns drove the growth of AUM and overall hedge fund performance surged through the year-end. Gains were driven by a welcome decline in inflation, positive developments in mergers and acquisitions (\"M&amp;A\") and a growing optimism in the economic outlook for 2024. [8]</p><p>Going into 2024, hedge fund performance is expected to improve further. Preqin estimates that the hedge fund industry will grow at an annual rate of 3.6% between the end of 2022 and 2028, to an estimated US$5.2 trillion. [9] We are seeing a trend towards data democratisation, which will unlock greater access to data to facilitate business and portfolio decisions. This, coupled with the evolution of generative artificial intelligence (\"Gen AI\"), will enable portfolio managers to enhance their research capabilities and trading strategies in order to stay competitive. I will elaborate on this later.</p><p>We have also observed strong growth in private credit. Aggregate capital raised by private credit funds globally stood at about US$151.9 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. [10] Fundraising held up in a difficult year as investors moved into more defensive assets in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Private credit fundraising has outperformed other private capital strategies, driven by increasing investor interest in direct lending, due to its floating rate nature, a shorter term to maturity and higher seniority in the capital stack. In line with this, GPs are increasingly targeting investments into this space. The number of private credit funds in the market hit a record high last year, growing by 19% in the period from 2022 to October 2023. [11] Global private credit AUM is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") of 11.1% between 2022 and 2028 to reach an all-time high of US$2.8 trillion. This would be almost double the 2022 AUM of US$1.5 trillion. [12]</p><p>The figures I've cited are global figures, but the overall long-term outlook for Asia Pacific (\"APAC\") private markets remains similarly positive, with a projected annualised growth rate of 12.7% from 2021 to 2027. Notably, APAC-focused private credit AUM is projected to reach a new all-time high of US$115.9 billion at the end of 2027, representing a CAGR of 8.0% from 2021 to 2027. [13]</p><p>Within APAC, Singapore continues to be an attractive centre for alternative and hedge fund managers to set up their regional investment teams. More global hedge fund managers are setting up offices here, with more than 250 of such managers as at the end of last year. We have also seen an increase in the number of private credit and other alternative managers in Singapore, including Apollo, Blackstone, HPS and Oaktree.</p><p>Mega Forces Shaping the Future of the Industry</p><p>The alternatives sector has shown good resilience in the face of headwinds. But what lies ahead? For this, we need to look at the mega forces that are shaping the future of investments. I will cover three of these forces today.</p><p>Accelerating Net Zero Transition</p><p>The first mega force - the net zero transition. While climate change is not a new topic, it is a global threat that is more urgent than ever and demands action now. Traditionally, the climate transition theme was centred around public market investments, but the focus is pivoting to private markets, creating new investment opportunities for the alternatives sector. Alternative managers can capitalise on emerging opportunities in areas such as renewable energy, green buildings, sustainable food and agriculture, electric mobility, and green infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to generating alpha for investors, the alternatives sector is uniquely positioned to address some of the most pressing challenges our world faces today. Decarbonisation is a costly affair, yet the financial support for climate action remains insufficient. By some estimates, US$9.2 trillion is needed annually to reach net zero by 2050. This is US$3.5 trillion more than what is being invested each year today. [14] Singapore, as an international financial hub, is well-placed to catalyse sustainable and transition financing needs for the region and globally.</p><p>To support this, MAS has launched a series of initiatives in the last few months.</p><p>First, we launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance. In addition to defining green activities, the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy is the world's first taxonomy to comprehensively define transition activities across eight key sectors. The detailed criteria for activities to qualify as \"green\" are aligned with a 1.5 degree Celsius net zero outcome, while \"amber\" activities are activities that are transitioning towards green within a certain time frame or enabling significant emissions reductions in the short term. The taxonomy will serve as a practical guide for asset managers, asset owners and other stakeholders to identify and allocate capital to green and transition activities and projects. MAS is working with industry stakeholders and government agencies to explore taxonomy use cases, including the development of taxonomy-aligned debt instruments, in both public and private markets, as well as thematic green and transition focused funds.</p><p>Another significant development is the recent establishment of the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (\"SSFA\"). This is an industry-led platform that will collaborate across the financial and real economy sectors to support Singapore's growth as a trusted, vibrant, and inclusive sustainable finance centre. The SSFA will:</p><p>Provide clarity in standards and develop industry best practices;<br/><br/>Drive innovative solutions by bringing together financial institutions and industry sectors to address the barriers that have kept us from scaling the finance needed; and<br/><br/>Deepen the pool of talent to support the growth of sustainable finance.<br/><br/>Why is the SSFA's work of relevance to you? Asset managers can play an active role in stewarding companies to develop decarbonisation solutions and decarbonise. There are opportunities for asset managers to work closely with their investee companies to use innovative approaches, such as blended finance and carbon credits, to drive greater impact and value. These are two priority areas for SSFA. More broadly, through SSFA, asset managers can collaborate with stakeholders in the financial and real economy sectors to scale financing in energy transition. This could be, for example, through investments in decarbonisation technologies, or in renewables and other low carbon fuels.</p><p>Growing the Digital Assets Ecosystem</p><p>The second mega force of note is digitalisation. Finance will not be spared from the digital disruption we have seen in other industries, and decentralised finance and blockchain technology have taken centre stage.</p><p>MAS is collaborating with the asset management industry through Project Guardian to pilot asset tokenisation initiatives using Singapore fund structures. Through these industry pilots, we seek to enhance operational efficiency, lower costs and expand investor bases.</p><p>Asset managers including Schroders, Franklin Templeton and UBS Asset Management have launched pilots to explore the native issuance of tokenised investment vehicles through a Variable Capital Company (\"VCC\") structure on digital asset networks.<br/><br/>Alternative manager Apollo Global Management is also exploring how tokenisation and smart contracts can enable the seamless investment and ongoing management of discretionary portfolios, including those involving alternative assets. By standardising subscription and redemption processes, automating portfolio rebalancing, customising portfolios efficiently at scale and enabling cross-chain interoperability, the Apollo pilot demonstrates how portfolios can be built and connected across the fragmented landscape of funds, even when these are tokenised on multiple networks.<br/><br/>For this to scale, what is needed is a fundamental transformation of the financial infrastructure underpinning the asset management industry and the development of a truly interoperable digital asset network and ecosystem. To achieve this, MAS has launched the Global Layer One initiative. This seeks to establish a foundational digital infrastructure across multiple distributed ledger technology networks, to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions and enable tokenised assets to be traded across global liquidity pools, while meeting relevant regulatory requirements.</p><p>Exploring the Potential of Gen AI</p><p>Let me move on to the final mega force I will cover today. We are currently standing in the foothills of what many view as the next great digital revolution - Gen AI. With its ability to process large and diverse data sets and generate content, Gen AI has the potential to transform businesses and reshape the workforce.</p><p>In asset management, Gen AI offers the potential to improve operational efficiency - for example, in the communication of returns and performance attribution. Gen AI is also being looked at to mitigate risks, such as in the protection against cyber-attacks. Gen AI engines are also increasingly being used in fund managers' toolkits for asset allocation and the selection of securities. We have seen financial institutions use Gen AI in ETF products - an example of this is an active ETF recently launched by Lion Global Investors and Nomura Asset Management. This ETF invests in equity securities listed on the Japanese exchanges, based primarily on recommendations from proprietary AI and machine learning models. I am sure we will see more of such use cases and products in the near future.</p><p>Given these developments in Gen AI, it is imperative that asset managers be mindful of its risks, such as when used in complex investment and compliance tasks. For example, AI hallucinations can result in inaccurate and misleading outcomes which could lead to poor investment decision-making. Another risk is data bias. If the training data used to create the Gen AI model is biased, this bias can potentially be amplified in the generated data, thereby increasing the risks of less-than-desirable compliance outcomes. MAS is working with the industry to study this further under Project MindForge [15] , which is developing a Gen AI risk framework for the financial sector.</p><p>As we tap on Gen AI in our work, we should also consider its consequent impact on jobs and skills in Singapore. MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance Singapore (\"IBF\") will jointly conduct a study to identify core Gen AI use cases. The study will also cover how Gen AI will be adopted and scaled in financial services, its corresponding impact on jobs and the skills required. Through this study, we will examine how we can upskill and reskill the financial sector workforce, to ensure that industry players can capitalise on the transformative potential of Gen AI, while facilitating potential job transitions and new career pathways.</p><p>AIMA - A Valued Industry Partner</p><p>The net zero transition, digitalisation and Gen AI - our collective and continued commitment to meeting these new mega forces - and the many that lie ahead - has cultivated a dynamic and vibrant asset management ecosystem. This spirit of innovation and partnership is a hallmark of Singapore's financial centre.</p><p>AIMA plays an important role in our financial centre and is a valued industry partner. AIMA has provided helpful feedback on the development of the VCC framework and our funds tax regime. I have also appreciated AIMA's support and contributions to promotion and engagement efforts over the years.</p><p>On this note, we hope to continue the strong partnership with AIMA as we work together to strengthen the alternatives ecosystem in Singapore. We remain committed to work closely with AIMA and its members to tap on growth opportunities, including in the key emerging areas that I have spoken about today.</p><p>I wish you a fruitful discussion ahead.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] MSCI AC World Index</p><p>[2] S&amp;P Global</p><p>[3] Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla</p><p>[4] Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index</p><p>[5] Preqin's State of the Market 1H 2024</p><p>[6] International Monetary Fund - Press Briefing: Regional Economic Outlook Update for Asia and Pacific (31 January 2024)</p><p>[7] Monetary Authority of Singapore - Monetary Policy Statement (29 January 2024)</p><p>[8] Hedge Fund Research</p><p>[9] Preqin Future of Alternatives 2028</p><p>[10] Preqin Global Report Private Debt 2024</p><p>[11] Preqin Alternatives in 2024</p><p>[12] Preqin Global Report Private Debt 2024</p><p>[13] Preqin Alternatives in APAC 2023</p><p>[14] McKinsey &amp; Company</p><p>[15] MAS Partners Industry to Develop Generative AI Risk Framework for the Financial Sector (15 Nov 2023)</p><p>[Category: Financial/ Capital Market, Investment Banking &amp; Brokerage, Events]</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["While climate change is not a new topic, it is a global threat that is more urgent than ever and demands action now.

As we experience warmer days and more unpredictable rainy seasons, South-east Asian countries are increasingly looking to nature to help us cope with the effects of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore is recognised as a champion of urban greenery or so-called urban \"nature-based solutions\", and its experience and know-how benefit other countries. </p><p> Yet let's not forget that Singapore is an exception when it comes to urbanisation in Asia-Pacific: Being a landlocked city-state, its horizontal growth is limited by the social and environmental costs of land reclamation. </p><p> Most importantly, Singapore's unique socio-economic policies mean that it is likely the only country in the region without informal settlements or slums -- neighbourhoods often with precarious housing and limited access to infrastructure.</p><p> According to United Nations estimates, more than one billion people live in informal settlements globally, and South and South-east Asia are currently home to most of them. The residents of quickly growing informal settlements are disproportionately affected by hazards such as heatwaves and floods.</p><p> This makes it important to study the win-win potential of nature-based solutions for informal settlements: Not only could these solutions help address current climate hazards -- by providing shade for heat mitigation or absorbing water for flood reduction -- but they could also help improve living conditions more broadly, by supporting food production or fostering social cohesion. </p><p> And the cherry on top is that nature-based solutions also help address the unfolding biodiversity crisis in the region by promoting an ecosystem-based approach and restoring or protecting current ecosystems.</p><p> What we know about nature-based solutions  in informal settlementsTo move from theory to practice, we recently reviewed hundreds of documents from South-east Asian and the Pacific countries to examine the state of the art. </p><p> We found 37 projects that are already using such solutions in informal settlements -- a figure that is a lower bound of the actual number of projects, as not all projects are documented, let alone in English-language literature. </p><p> Yet these projects demonstrate that at least six types of nature-based solutions are used in the region, including tree planting, constructed wetlands and coastal reforestation.</p><p> These projects are concentrated in eight countries (shown on the map) and are implemented by governments, communities and non-governmental organisations, such as the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights and the Cities Alliance. </p><p> Most of the projects are located in Indonesia and Vietnam, but Cambodia, Fiji and Thailand also have experiences with nature-based solutions in informal settlements. </p><p> Our review showed that while mangrove planting and other well-established nature-based solutions can be useful to combat the effects of climate change, lesser-known types of solutions are also key to prepare cities in Asia-Pacific for the future.</p><p> Experiences from South-east Asian cities show that various types of projects, ranging from community gardens to constructed wetlands, can also improve the access to food, health and culture in informal settlements. </p><p> Large projects such as the Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments programme in Indonesia and initiatives funded by The Rockefeller Foundation in Thailand, for example, demonstrate that nature-based solutions can offer multiple benefits, including improving water quality, preventing soil erosion, providing habitat to native species and beautifying cities.</p><p> We also found that \"grassroots\" low-cost initiatives, such as community gardens, play important roles for people living in informal settlements. These solutions, often developed by residents and local organisations, are important to improve food security, create bonds between community members and provide spaces for recreation and connection with nature.</p><p> Future of nature-based solutions in informal settlementsWhile these initiatives show that nature-based solutions can help communities across the Asia-Pacific be better prepared for the effects of climate change, some challenges remain for their implementation. </p><p> Some of these projects, such as an aerated lagoon in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, occupy a significant amount of land -- a precious resource in informal settlements -- while some types of urban farming require expensive maintenance efforts. </p><p> Many of these projects are also not being monitored, so we don't know if they are effective and sustainable in the long term. It is important that these projects continue to be implemented, but also that they are managed adaptively to ensure they continue performing as expected and providing all their benefits to their communities.</p><p> So where to go from here? </p><p> We need more research on how nature-based solutions are being designed, installed and maintained. The examples found in the Asia-Pacific region show that they are more effective when they are connected to local needs and when communities are deeply involved in their implementation and use. </p><p> It is key, for example, to understand and design solutions that are appropriate to each context, as some communities might perceive nature as untidy or dangerous. Addressing these concerns during project implementation is essential to ensure that communities feel represented and can be important stewards of nature in the city.</p><p> While the story of how Asia-Pacific cities prepare for climate change is still being written, there is no doubt that nature will play an important role. </p><p> The experiences with nature-based solutions in informal settlements demonstrate that having nature in cities can provide vulnerable communities with invaluable opportunities to produce food, clean the rivers and cope with hot days.</p><p> If we can leverage their benefits and make sure that nature-based solutions are well-designed and maintained, it is clear they can make our cities more biodiverse, liveable and prepared to deal with the effects of climate change.</p><p> Erich Wolff is a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University's Asian School of the Environment.

And up to a 40 per cent emissions reduction is envisaged by transitioning from the current linear economy to a more circular one. Moreover, the circular industrial economy reduces dependence on virgin resources and generates resources from the solid waste generated by consumerism. A circular economy emulates the circularity of nature, wherein there is no waste, and dead matter becomes food for other animals or plants. Singapore and others such as the European Union are pursuing green economic growth amidst global uncertainties and to demonstrate their responsible behaviour to improve the global commons. Green growth includes greening existing industries and creating new green industries. The ways and means depend on the country's economic structure, industrial strengths, geography, demography, access to resources and technologies, international relationships, investing ability, and politics. For example, the 32 sq km Jurong Island, which houses more than 100 leading chemical and energy companies, stands as a major pillar of Singapore's economy and sustainability drive. The Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES), the national society of engineers, formulated the IES Green Plan 2030 in line with Singapore's green growth interests. At its launch on January 17, Grace Fu, minister for sustainability and the environment, said : \"Tackling climate change is a complex engineering problem. It requires innovation in products, productions, and systems. Over the years, from our water and energy infrastructure, housing, and transport systems, engineers have established new frontiers for Singapore with your expertise and innovative solutions.\"Take Singapore's approach towards water. The Republic employed smart and innovative engineering solutions to collect, treat, recycle, and supply water. Per capita household water consumption was reduced from 165 litres a day in 2000 to 141 litres in 2018. The target by 2030 is around 130 litres. Green, circular, and smart water solutions are growth opportunities as demand for them is growing around the world. Singapore has also begun to decarbonise energy, which has been dominated by fossil fuels. Adoption of energy efficiency technologies and solar energy is growing steadily. A full transformation requires harnessing smart grid technologies, hydrogen energy, and nuclear energy. Decarbonised energy technologies are poised for mass production as the global market for them will grow to US$1trillion a year in the next two decades.Longer-life batteries, safer fuel cells, biofuel, and carbon capture and conversion technologies are necessary to decarbonise the energy systems of land, sea, and air transport.The manufacturing industry is expected to embrace decarbonised materials, processes, and components with enhanced circularity performance. Notable examples include low-carbon footprint steel, aluminium, and concrete. There will be zero-energy and energy-plus buildings that employ energy efficiency technologies, circular materials, and low-carbon digital technologies. A prime example is sustainable data centres, at the heart of the growing digitalisation drive.Digital technologies are helpful to monitor carbon offsets and nature-based climate solutions so as to develop investors' and public confidence. These include engineering solutions using drones and data for real-time and predictive analytics, and for cost-effective management of large-scale physical assets. Further innovative engineering solutions are needed to mitigate rising sea levels and erosion of land and coastal areas. Singapore engineers are expeditiously building polders at Pulau Tekong. Furthermore, cyber-informed engineering ensures the security of the critical infrastructure.Scaling up urban farms and biological processes is necessary to satisfy the food nutrition and security needs of the growing world population. Producing valuable materials from food waste and farm waste is yet another green growth opportunity. In recycling, the extended producers' responsibility (EPR) scheme for e-waste, and the forthcoming beverage containers return scheme (BCRS), require harnessing digital technologies such as labelling, reverse vending machines, and robots for automatic sorting and segregation. They spell opportunities in circular economy waste businesses and new jobs.Businesses need to invest in the skills and technologies to pursue green growth.

Decarbonised energy technologies are poised for mass production as the global market for them will grow to US$1 trillion a year in the next two decades.</p><p> Longer-life batteries, safer fuel cells, biofuel, and carbon capture and conversion technologies are necessary to decarbonise the energy systems of land, sea, and air transport.</p><p> The manufacturing industry is expected to embrace decarbonised materials, processes, and components with enhanced circularity performance. Notable examples include low-carbon footprint steel, aluminium, and concrete. </p><p> There will be zero-energy and energy-plus buildings that employ energy efficiency technologies, circular materials, and low-carbon digital technologies. A prime example is sustainable data centres, at the heart of the growing digitalisation drive.</p><p> Digital technologies are helpful to monitor carbon offsets and nature-based climate solutions so as to develop investors' and public confidence. These include engineering solutions using drones and data for real-time and predictive analytics, and for cost-effective management of large-scale physical assets. </p><p> Further innovative engineering solutions are needed to mitigate rising sea levels and erosion of land and coastal areas. Singapore engineers are expeditiously building polders at Pulau Tekong. Furthermore, cyber-informed engineering ensures the security of the critical infrastructure.</p><p> Scaling up urban farms and biological processes is necessary to satisfy the food nutrition and security needs of the growing world population. Producing valuable materials from food waste and farm waste is yet another green growth opportunity. </p><p> In recycling, the extended producers' responsibility (EPR) scheme for e-waste, and the forthcoming beverage containers return scheme (BCRS), require harnessing digital technologies such as labelling, reverse vending machines, and robots for automatic sorting and segregation.

As of March 31, Singapore's public sector has issued $8.2 billion of green bonds across four categories: Clean transportation, waste management, green building and sustainable water.</p><p>According to the Singapore Green Bond Framework published in June 2022, bond proceeds will fund projects classified as \"nationally significant\" under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or Singa.</p><p>These projects should be controlled and legally owned by the government, cost at least $4 billion, last minimally for 50 years and support national productivity or Singapore's economic, environmental or social sustainability.</p><p>Potential investments under Singa include projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, clean transportation, sustainable water and wastewater management, pollution prevention, climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable management of natural resources and land use.</p><p>Examples include the upcoming Jurong Region Line (JRL) and Cross Island Line (CRL) in Singapore's rail network. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) allocated $700 million, or around 30% of the proceeds from its first green bond, to the two rail lines during FY2022 ended March 31 this year.</p><p>The remaining $1.7 billion is expected to be fully allocated to the JRL and CRL by the end of FY2024, according to the first edition of the Singapore Green Bond Report, released on Sept 21.</p><p>The JRL is scheduled to open in three stages from 2027 to 2029.

It is seen as dirty and destructive, or even corrupt and dangerous -- at times, it must be said, with good reason.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The resources sector, however, will be crucial to the world's energy transition. Clean energy technologies require far more lithium, nickel, copper, cobalt and other minerals than their fossil-fuel counterparts -- an electric car uses five times more minerals than a combustion engine one, for example -- and a supply crunch is looming.</p><p> The pathway to net-zero emissions requires immense investment in green technology and infrastructure, all of which will cause global demand for minerals to surge. China alone will need to spend an additional US$17 trillion on green infrastructure and technology in the power and transport sectors to reach its national goal of net-zero emissions by 2060, according to the World Bank.</p><p> As Tribeca Investment Partners, we expect demand for lithium to jump more than 40-fold by 2040, while the use of graphite, cobalt and nickel -- all critical to electrification and battery storage -- will soar at least 20-fold. Benchmark Minerals, a leading resources research group, calculates that at least 384 new mines are needed to meet demand by 2035.</p><p> These projections represent an unprecedented opportunity for both investors and the resources industry, but mobilising the investment needed to scale up supply will require some big changes on both sides. Providers of capital need to rethink their exclusionary policies, and resources companies will need to clean up their act.</p><p> Divestment does not solve the problemThere are good reasons why sustainability-focused investors must remain engaged with the metals and mining industry. </p><p> For one, simply exiting from investments in carbon-intensive industries might look good on paper, but it does not achieve anything in the real world. Studies have shown that divesting does not make a meaningful impact on companies' behaviour.</p><p> Divestment could, in fact, worsen the impact of resource extraction on the environment, as assets fall into the hands of companies that are not publicly listed, and therefore are less accountable for the impact on the environment.</p><p> Divestment also raises the cost of capital for the resources sector, by making it harder for companies to raise equity or access debt markets. That risks impeding the flow of investment for new projects needed to power clean energy.</p><p> Moreover, by remaining engaged, investors have an opportunity to influence strategy. We have seen many examples of investors encouraging boards and management teams to address ESG concerns.</p><p> Publicly listed resources companies face greater pressure to decarbonise than unlisted businesses -- whether they are privately owned or state-run enterprises. Listed mining companies, in particular, are starting to commit to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 by repositioning their businesses to operate in a more sustainable manner.</p><p> For a mining company, that could mean installing renewable power at extraction sites, converting diesel trucks to electric ones, or shifting operations from coal to gas power.</p><p> These steps will not get the world to net zero overnight, but they are important interim measures that will make companies better placed to access capital for more ambitious transition plans in the future.</p><p> Within the resources sector, we believe less carbon-intensive metals and mining companies will have a distinct competitive advantage as consumers demand more sustainable products and companies tackle Scope 3 emissions -- that is, those associated with their supply chains.</p><p> Major United States and European electric vehicle manufacturers, for example, are already looking for battery suppliers that can demonstrate low carbon footprints and high ESG standards.</p><p> In Asia, resources companies that can leverage this dynamic by showing leadership on climate and ESG issues will trade at higher multiples and benefit from lower financing costs.</p><p> The energy transition is also an opportunity for the region to move up the climate value chain.</p><p> Take Indonesia, the world's biggest producer of nickel. Right now, most of that nickel is exported to China as low-grade pig iron for use in stainless steel. With the right investment, Indonesia's nickel reserves could be mined more sustainably and processed into higher-value battery-grade exports.</p><p> Future regulation, such as Europe's proposed carbon tariff system, will solidify the connection between carbon intensity and corporate earnings.</p><p>Finnish oil company Neste, for example, has diversified into developing solutions to combat climate change and is now the world's largest producer of sustainable diesel and jet fuel. This has helped its valuation rise above its peers to 9.8 times 2024 earnings. </p><p> Repositioning resourcesAsia's resources companies have a similar opportunity to parlay bumper profits from high commodity prices to reposition themselves for a net-zero world.</p><p> Responsible investors have an important role to play in directing the mining industry towards a more sustainable future. This is why Tribeca is sponsoring Resource Connect Asia's Future Facing Commodities Forum this year in Singapore.</p><p> Metals and minerals are critical to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis -- and continued investment will be essential in scaling up the supply of resources needed to power the energy transition. Investors and mining companies need to work together to help the industry transition from a maligned relic of the fossil-fuel age to a key foundation of the future economy.</p><p> The writer is head of research for global natural resources strategy and portfolio manager for 2050 strategy at Tribeca Investment Partners.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Clean energy technologies require far more lithium, nickel, copper, cobalt and other minerals than their fossil-fuel counterparts -- an electric car uses five times more minerals than a combustion engine one, for example -- and a supply crunch is looming.

GuocoLand's integrated project, Lentor Modern, also swept the board to win seven awards, including Top Development, Sustainability Excellence and Design Excellence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taking the stage to accept the Top Developer award on behalf of GuocoLand, Dora Chng, director residential, GuocoLand, says the honour of winning the coveted prize is especially meaningful as it is also a recognition of the collective efforts of the entire GuocoLand team.</p><p>\"Building a development takes several years, so this award is not just a measure of our success in the last year, but we also take it as a recognition of our evolution over the years (as a company),\" she says, adding: \"Our dedication to redefine modern living for the better remains our guiding light.\"</p><p>Liveable, useable and adaptable</p><p>As a leading property developer in Singapore for over 30 years, GuocoLand has refined the guiding principle that has enabled it to deliver highly liveable homes that are functional and practical for a diverse range of homeowners, says Chng.</p><p>She adds: \"We prioritise liveability, usability and adaptability in all our developments. We design from the 'inside-out' - meaning we consider the user's perspective and imagine how we ourselves would want our home to be if we were living in it.\"</p><p>At the heart of this design philosophy is \"people-centrism\" - a guiding principle that ensures each step, from conceptualisation to design and from interiors to the choice of facilities, is geared towards enhancing the lives of residents, says Chng.</p><p>Crafting liveable homes goes beyond the four walls of each condo unit and apartment. GuocoLand has demonstrated that its projects take a holistic approach focusing on design, connectivity, concept and community. Some of its landmark projects that best reflect this vision include integrated developments such as Guoco Tower in Tanjong Pagar, Guoco Midtown in Bugis and Lentor Modern in Lentor.</p><p>\"The concept of the development and the community living within it are key differentiators that make our projects an outstanding quality home. A development with a strong concept can attract like-minded people with similar interests, creating a harmonious community where residents feel a strong sense of belonging,\" says Chng.</p><p>Spearheading rejuvenation in Lentor</p><p>The most recent example of GuocoLand's hand in this type of placemaking and community building can be seen at Lentor Modern, a landmark development in the Lentor neighbourhood and the only integrated development in that area.</p><p>\"Lentor Modern has attracted homebuyers who seek a contemporary lifestyle directly connected to the MRT network, shopping and F&amp;B options, and close to nature,\" says Chng. \"With Lentor Modern, we are spearheading the rejuvenation and transformation of the Lentor neighbourhood.\"</p><p>Lentor Modern comprises 605 residential units across three 25-storey residential blocks and a 96,000 sq ft retail mall directly connected to Lentor MRT Station on the Thomson-East Coast Line. The project was successfully launched for sale in September 2022 to overwhelming response from buyers who snapped up 508 units (84%) on opening day on Sept 17. According to URA developer sales data, the project was about 92% sold as at the end of September this year.</p><p>\"As the only integrated, mixed-use development in the area, Lentor Modern enhances connectivity and brings modern conveniences to residents and visitors,\" says Chng. She adds that careful consideration was taken to ensure that Lentor Modern, like all of GuocoLand's residential projects, is future-oriented but also adaptable to changing needs.</p><p>The panel of judges of the EPEA 2023 were also convinced of the forward-thinking planning and design consideration demonstrated by Lentor Modern. They gave the project high scores across all judged categories. Thus, Lentor Modern took home awards for Landscape Excellence, Design Excellence, Sustainability Excellence, Innovation Excellence, Marketing Excellence, and Showflat Excellence, as well as Top Development in the Uncompleted (Mixed-use) category.</p><p>Only two projects this year claim a clean sweep across all judged categories; the only other project was UOL Group's AMO Residence. Chng says that GuocoLand is working hard to outdo itself at its subsequent development in Lentor, which it won in a government land sale with joint venture partner Hong Leong Holdings in April. The new project at Lentor Gardens is targeted for launch in 1H2024. \"We envision another high-quality residential project imbued with modern concepts of living amidst nature and greenery and elevated by convenient access to amenities in the neighbourhood,\" she says.</p><p>Empowering innovation</p><p>Top developers like GuocoLand pave the way forward by pushing the envelope for good design standards and empowering innovative good practices. This is driven by a common goal to uplift the lifestyles of residents, tenants, and other uses of the spaces we create, says Chng.</p><p>But pushing the boundaries of innovation is a gradual collaborative process, she says. In her acceptance speech, she says: \"Coming up with a modern and highly liveable home for our homebuyers is not always an easy feat. It takes a dedicated team who may have differing views on what should take precedence in the development that is being designed. But with strong bonds and trust between colleagues, coupled with good communication within the team and with our consultants and partners, we end up achieving our common goal - a better product for our customers\".</p><p>\"Often, the best and most widespread innovations do not need to use 'rocket science'. Instead, it should be simple for all to use and enjoy,\" she says.</p><p>At the heart of any good innovation in real estate is the community that lives, works and plays there. This helps to bring life and vitality into the development and the right placemaking efforts, especially in public spaces, can serve as communal meeting points and event spaces for the community.</p><p>An example is Guoco Tower's Urban Park and the regular activation of the space through activities and events. This has had a profound positive impact on the Tanjong Pagar area which has transformed and activated the district into a business and lifestyle destination in the CBD.</p><p>\"This placemaking strategy has also been woven into our other developments. For Guoco Midtown, we embraced an open and porous design philosophy. The development boasts 30 gardens, of which 10 are open to the public and I must say that I'm pleased with how the gardens are coming along,\" says Chng.</p><p>Good design also considers the existing built environment around any new project, and at Guoco Midtown the architecture reflects the neighbouring shophouses with an open design and includes an internal street inspired by the neighbourhood. \"The design of the development invites people to walk and explore the location, and facilitates alfresco dining at our retail clusters,\" says Chng.</p><p>Similarly, a public plaza at Lentor Modern is the social heart of the development. The plaza will be flanked by F&amp;B units. When it is completed and activated with events, it will serve as a space for the local community.</p><p>Biophilic connections</p><p>This year, the EPEA shines the spotlight on sustainability in Singapore's built environment. This is an area GuocoLand has consistently demonstrated as a critical consideration for all its projects, emphasising the biophilic connections between the built environment and society.</p><p>\"Humans have an inherent inclination to seek connections and affiliate with nature and greenery, and the post-Covid lifestyle has only heightened this. There is now a renewed focus on personal well-being, the work-from-home environment, and the need for spaces that promote physical and mental health,\" says Chng.</p><p>Lush, expansive greenery elevates the visual appeal and contributes to a cooler environment, enhancing comfort for residents. However, the developer also has a responsibility to ensure that curated landscapes are also natural and easy to maintain.</p><p>Biophilic spaces - designed to deliver benefits for human health and the environment - are cognisant of the diverse needs of residents. For example, open lawns where children can freely play, and adults can engage in activities like tai chi and yoga, to more intimate spaces like spa pools or niches in sky terraces.</p><p>\"Ultimately, what is important is the usability and relevance of the spaces. It is essential to provide facilities that residents will use and genuinely appreciate instead of offering many amenities that remain underutilised and eventually become redundant,\" says Chng.</p><p>GuocoLand and other leading developers in Singapore have also leveraged green financing, a type of loan or investment promoting environmentally positive activities such as the purchase of ecologically friendly construction materials or the development of green infrastructure and facilities.</p><p>\"Green financing is an example of our proactive approach to sustainable development. In June 2023, we introduced the GuocoLand Green Finance Framework, envisioned to bolster our ongoing decarbonisation journey and contributions to the Singapore Green Plan 2030,\" says Chng.</p><p>The developer has since secured a $974 million green facility for the refinancing of Guoco Tower and $498.6 million of green loans for its upcoming Lentor Gardens development. GuocoLand has also pledged that the Lentor Gardens project will be its first residential project to achieve BCA's Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy) with Maintainability Badge certification.</p><p>Thriving amid adversity</p><p>Although a momentous year for GuocoLand, the company has not been immune to the headwinds buffeting Singapore's real estate market and the challenging macroeconomic climate. \"Externally, the current environment is a challenging one. There are macro-economic factors that impact our costs, and there are many other uncertainties and issues that we face daily,\" says Chng.</p><p>However, she says that GuocoLand's track record has shown its ability to navigate and thrive amidst adversity. This resiliency is rooted in its belief that well-designed developments and units remain in high demand, especially in Singapore's competitive residential market. She adds that recent successful sales launches, such as that of Lentor Modern, show that its projects resonate strongly among local audiences.</p><p>\"Our continuous drive for excellence has positioned GuocoLand as a benchmark for quality in the real estate sector.

As a result of that, you've got to ensure that the skills and competencies towards ESG actually percolate throughout your organisation.\"</p><p>Lim, who is also a professor of communication and technology at SMU, acknowledges that older workers may be unwilling to change their working styles or job scope. \"It's really quite instinctive if you think about it: you've been doing something the same way for a while, you are rather good at it and you want to just do it the same old way. But then disruption comes along and you're uncertain, you're insecure, you don't have the right skillsets and you feel very unsure about how to plan your career shift.\"</p><p>Thus, employers should be sensitive when introducing changes to the workplace, says Lim. \"When there's that sense of insecurity, organisations actually need to be a little more proactive about providing that support, so that you give people that sense of competency building - that sense that you're in this together, the organisation is behind you, creating for you certain upskilling pathways.\"</p><p>Today's skills crunch is a result of us not investing enough in sustainability competency across organisations and the education system, says Lee Hui Mien, senior director for group environment sustainability at Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), on the same panel as Lim.</p><p>\"One of the common challenges we see is in companies that rely a lot on a strong sustainability department,\" says Lee. \"The challenge is: If there's a turnover in the sustainability department, then some of the good work that the company has done over the years might just fizzle out or stay stagnant.\"</p><p>It all boils down to what really matters to corporate leaders, says Lee, who joined Singtel in 2021 from Mandai Park Development and Wildlife Reserves Singapore. \"Generally, my experience is [that] people don't necessarily want to go against sustainability. No one would say no to sustainability if they don't have other competing priorities.\"</p><p>A 'high-growth economy'</p><p>SkillsFuture published in November 2022 the second edition of the Skills Demand for the Future Economy Report, highlighting three \"high-growth economies in Singapore\" - the green, digital and care economies.</p><p>The Ministry of Education statutory board divides the green sector into four \"emerging domains\" - environmental and sustainability management; energy, resource circularity and decarbonisation; green infrastructure and mobility; and sustainable finance.</p><p>\"While green infrastructure and mobility; and energy, resource circularity and decarbonisation are key skills areas that see very high demand growth, they are dwarfed by skills demand growth in the domain of sustainable finance,\" reads SkillsFuture's public report. \"On the other hand, skills in the environmental and sustainability management domain enjoy high transferability.\"</p><p>Demand for skills in the green infrastructure and mobility domain grew by almost 200% from 2018 to 2021, adds SkillsFuture. \"This results from the growing need to imbue green building strategies into every aspect of the built environment, and the transition to cleaner energy transportation   With more buildings and transport systems being required to meet mandatory emissions goals, more jobs will require skills to develop, implement and maintain urban infrastructure while meeting low-to-zero emissions targets.\"</p><p>Within these domains, SkillsFuture highlights certain priority skills, or skills Singaporeans can \"prioritise to enter and thrive in emerging sectors\". These skills were derived from SkillsFuture's National Jobs-Skills Intelligence engine and validated with expert input from industry, academia and sector agencies.</p><p>Demand growth for a given priority skill refers to the growth in employers' demand for the skill, as reflected in job postings over the four calendar years 2018 to 2021.</p><p>For example, demand growth for green facilities management was up an eye-watering 2,300%, while demand growth for the design and implementation of climate-mitigating features in the built environment was up 279%. \"Demand for skills required throughout the entire built environment value chain is observed to be growing   These skills are needed by job roles such as architect/architectural associate, engineering design engineer and facilities manager.\"</p><p>As part of Singapore's energy transition, skills under the energy, resource circularity and decarbonisation domain are in hot demand, especially those involving solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.

Prime examples include renewables and reducing carbon emissions, or energy efficiency in the energy industry, they add. \"In other industries, it could be about sustainable use of building materials or reducing food waste or recycling.\"</p><p>\"Just as our engineers and technicians have innovated and facilitated our nation to realise water circularity and water security over the past five decades, Singapore's net-zero and circular economy commitments now provide the impetus for our engineers and technicians to strive and innovate in the coming years and decades,\" say the IES leaders to SkillsFuture.</p><p>Emerging demand in finance, food</p><p>SkillsFuture adds that growing demand for skills in emerging areas relating to sustainable finance, urban farming, food technologies and novel food development.</p><p>The financial services sector is beginning to introduce green investments, loans and financial instruments to support companies tapping green economy opportunities, says SkillsFuture. \"In particular, skills in carbon markets and decarbonisation strategies management and sustainable investment management saw the highest demand growths of 1,700% and 1,550% respectively, albeit starting at relatively low bases.\"</p><p>Some examples of job roles requiring these skills include investment analyst, underwriting manager, and sales and distribution specialist or coverage officer.</p><p>Demand for skills in urban farming, food technologies and novel food development is rising in tandem with Singapore's food security goal; the republic aims to produce 30% of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.</p><p>Global supply chain disruptions seen during the Covid-19 pandemic highlight the need to strengthen the local food industry, says SkillsFuture. Skills required by companies include urban farming implementation and management, and urban farming business development and management.</p><p>These support the growth of vertical farms within buildings' premises and rooftops, adds SkillsFuture. \"Job roles requiring these skills include business development manager, research and development engineer/executive and automation engineer.\"</p><p>At the same time, the development of food technologies and novel food concepts, such as plant-based proteins and lab-grown proteins, are also gaining traction locally. \"Skills in novel food development and implementation and sustainable food production design are required by job roles ranging from food technologist to chef, to quality assurance and quality control specialist,\" says SkillsFuture's report.</p><p>Graduates chime in</p><p>A green skills crunch may be gripping the industry today but are current data points ignoring tomorrow's workforce? In Google and Economist Impact's survey, for example, 63.2% of respondents were millennials, or those born between 1981 and 1996, inclusive of those years; nearly 12% were Generation Z (1997-2012) while a quarter were Generation X (1965-1980).</p><p>Younger Singaporeans have become vocal advocates for sustainability, with community groups like the Singapore Youth for Climate Action and the Inter-University Environmental Coalition (IUEC) seeking to engage youth here on green issues.</p><p>Could greater interest in sustainability among the youth signal a reprieve ahead for the current skills shortage?</p><p>Sustainability has been increasingly embedded into different tertiary courses, says Teng Chu Yu, who graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2022. \"[However,] more can be done to highlight its value across the short, medium and long term for students and their respective fields of study.\"</p><p>Teng, a global studies and geography graduate, is now a sustainability executive at the Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC).</p><p>Some universities, like Nanyang Technological University (NTU), have started including sustainability as a common core curriculum across all majors, which Teng calls \"a great start\". \"It would be great if we have access to survey results regarding the effectiveness of such courses in preparing students for the green economy.\"</p><p>NTU introduced the \"Sustainability: Society, Economy &amp; Environment\" module in 2021, which joined a list of seven Interdisciplinary Collaborative Core (ICC) courses that all NTU undergraduates must complete within their first two years of study.</p><p>NTU undergraduates may also pick up a second major in sustainability or a minor in environmental sustainability through modules offered by the university's Asian School of the Environment.</p><p>Back at NUS, Teng was among the founders of the IUEC, which brings together the student environment groups of seven local universities. In October 2022, the IUEC organised a two-day conference at ITE College Central attended by Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment; and Tan Kiat How, Senior Minister of State for National Development; among others.</p><p>Teng highlights NUS's Bachelor of Environmental Studies (BES) programme, launched in 2011. \"My acquaintances who graduated from BES are now working in the green finance sector [and] sustainability consulting; some are working as nature guides or in government agencies like the National Parks Board (NParks).\"</p><p>In 2021, NUS BES revamped its course to offer a \"cross-disciplinary degree programme\" (XDP) for students matriculating from that year. According to the prospectus, the programme prepares graduates to \"address national, regional and global environmental challenges\", such as over-exploitation, pollution, land and water use, habitat degradation and building liveable, high-density cities.</p><p>Some modules available to their students include communications for environmental studies, water science and technology, and principles of taxonomy and systematics. \"[The XDP] seeks to develop environmental leaders and advocates who are scientifically informed and capable of formulating solutions for a sustainable future,\" reads NUS's course description.</p><p>Academic structures may seem conventional and siloed with students in specific disciplines, but \"all that is breaking down\" in many universities, says SMU's Lim. She points to the College of Integrative Studies (CIS), established in 2022 as SMU's seventh school. This August, CIS will welcome its first intake of up to 100 students, who will be allowed to defer choosing their degree until the end of their first year.</p><p>SMU says students can \"individualise\" their majors by opting for the university's suite of about 1,000 modules across different schools. Lim adds: \"We've got students who can design their own majors, and I would imagine that there will be students who are very keen to design their own majors and degrees around sustainability and green issues.\"</p><p>Lim says educational institutions must \"take up the mantle\" to prepare students for \"one of the foremost challenges\" today - climate change. \"Universities are always engines of social impact and social transformation. We take our remit very seriously in terms of ensuring that our research is relevant to society and ensuring that our students are well-shepherded through university so that they get the best combination of skills.\"</p><p>Career professionals, too, may choose to return to school. SMU's professional training arm - SMU Academy - offers an Advanced Certificate in Sustainability and Sustainable Businesses, a 12-day programme held over four months with programme partner UN Global Compact Network Singapore.</p><p>According to SMU Academy's website, the course fee is $10,368 for international participants. Singaporeans aged 40 and above, however, could pay as little as $1,190.40 after various grants and company sponsorships.</p><p>As a sustainability recruiter, Povey-Hall offers up a few choice words of advice for fresh graduates and those reassessing their career trajectory in the green economy: \"For anyone who's looking at how to go about building their career, just step away from the binary of 'green' or 'not green'; think about the kind of work you want to do or have enjoyed doing, where you feel there's some kind of mission and purpose.\"</p><p>Povey-Hall lists a few questions they can ask themselves: \"Where do you want to sit on the spectrum: A big-impact SME or a huge global company? What is the impact you want to have? What is the lifestyle you want to have? Find the organisations that align with those, then look really deeply at their purpose, mission and vision and see how those fit with you.\"</p><p>Roles are dynamic and they have evolved quite a lot, says Povey-Hall, and today's surging demand for green skills will not last forever. \"Ultimately, a lot of them get integrated into the business. So, choosing the company first and then looking at the actual role itself is a much better way to find a long-term fit than looking at loads of different jobs, because in two years, that job will be different.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Singapore", "instances": ["No one would say no to sustainability if they don't have other competing priorities.

Our Investment Office is focused on building our portfolio of funds, and my team and I are involved in selecting and curating all the products that go onto our investment platform. We will not rest on our laurels, and will strive to stay ahead of the curve by doing a lot more in this relatively nascent area of investing.\" </p><p> The company's sustainability strategy is expressed through five focus areas: Being a Responsible Investor, an Accelerator of Net Zero, an Innovator for Green &amp; Good, and Building a Sustainability-Embedded Culture. Underpinning these priorities is the company's robust foundation in governance and risk management practices.</p><p> \"We believe that collective action on all areas will allow us to address environmental and social challenges more effectively, while supporting the creation of business value concurrently,\" explains Ko Wen.</p><p> Taking meaningful action Singlife has wasted no time in realising its sustainability ambitions since starting on this journey. Within a year, the company became a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Sustainable Insurance (UN PSI), set an ambitious target to become a net zero emissions business by 2050, and published its inaugural climate-related financial disclosure report.</p><p> This is aligned with recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) formed by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that seeks to strengthen and protect global financial markets from systemic risks such as climate change. \"These associations provide Singlife with the guidance to adopt best practices and demonstrate our sustainability commitment,\" says Ko Wen.</p><p> Ko Wen was appointed a member of the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee (SRAC) set up last year by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and Singapore Exchange Regulation to provide recommendations on the way forward for sustainability reporting in Singapore. In addition, Kim serves on the International Advisory Council for Climate Impact X -- a global marketplace, auctions and exchange platform for trusted carbon credits -- jointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and Temasek.</p><p> Singlife's sustainability efforts have extended to its customer solutions. The company has launched several ESG-related products including electric vehicle insurance, rainfall protection cover for travellers, and green logistics fleet insurance under MAS' Project Greenprint. </p><p> Investing responsibly Singlife seeks to safeguard the future not only through its insurance business, but also the way it invests. The company is of the view that the value, risks, and returns of a business which are increasingly impacted by ESG factors, must be considered carefully to achieve long-term and sustained value for all its stakeholders.</p><p> In particular, Singlife is working to reduce the contribution from its financed emissions in order to achieve its net zero emissions target by 2050. To do so, the firm is investing in environmentally responsible companies and solutions that support the transition to a greener economy. The company is also an advocate for the \"just transition\" approach, where social implications such as employment, human rights, and inclusion are also considered as it seeks to decarbonise its portfolios. </p><p> Singlife has committed over S$500 million towards sustainable investments as at the end of December 2022. These include investments in sustainable funds such as the Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners -- Green Credit Fund, Qblue Balanced -- Global Sustainable Leaders, BlackRock -- Decarbonization Partners, Singapore Government Green Infrastructure Bond, and the Altrium Sustainability Fund I, launched by Azalea Investment Management and co-seeded by Singlife and sponsor, the Azalea Group, an indirect subsidiary of Temasek.</p><p> The company's investment approach is guided by internationally recognised principles and standards, such as the UN PSI, United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Singapore Stewardship Principles. </p><p> Singlife has appointed a sustainability data provider, Matter, to better measure the impact and performance of its global investments. In particular, the company seeks to understand how aligned its portfolio is with the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and establish a baseline against which it can track its ESG progress. </p><p> Singlife's ESG activities go beyond its business to encompass the communities it operates in. To this end, it has been actively giving back through a variety of initiatives. In 2022, the company planted 100 trees in support of Singapore's National Parks Board's OneMillionTrees initiative, and has pledged to plant another 1,500 trees over the next five years to mitigate climate change and promote biodiversity. </p><p> Beyond that, the company is helping to shape lives for the better. Singlife is working with organisations such as Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities to run financial literacy programmes supporting individuals and their families in making informed financial decisions. </p><p> Singlife has also tied up with charity TomoWork, where its employees mentor students with special educational needs by offering advice and insights that can help guide them in their careers. It has also begun engaging with social service organisations that work with the less privileged, with a focus on wellbeing for caregivers and mental wellness.</p><p> Despite the progress made so far, Singlife is keenly aware of the challenges it faces in its sustainability journey. For one, its strategy is contingent on other players in its ecosystem -- such as their investee companies and suppliers -- being aligned with their climate action and emission reduction goals. </p><p> Says Ko Wen: \"Achieving our sustainability targets will require a collaborative effort involving our various stakeholders. It is also important that our sustainability initiatives are aligned to the business and generate long-term value for all of them.\" </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["The company is also an advocate for the \"just transition\" approach, where social implications such as employment, human rights, and inclusion are also considered as it seeks to decarbonise its portfolios.

Sustainable bond issuance totalled US$258 billion in 2Q2023, flat y-o-y and down 4% q-o-q, and made up 15% of the global bond market.</p><p>Sustainable bonds are a loose, collective term for four segments of bonds. During the quarter, there were US$156 billion of green bonds, US$51 billion of social bonds, US$40 billion of sustainability bonds, and US$11 billion of sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) - together known as GSSS bonds.</p><p>Total GSSS bond issuance reached $526 billion in 1H2023, a 7% increase y-o-y despite a decline in overall bond issuance. \"We expect sustainable bond issuance to remain fairly robust during the second half of the year, with the potential for issuance to eclipse our 2023 forecast of US$950 billion,\" reads a Moody's Investors Service report dated July 27.</p><p>The number of first-time sustainable bond issuers coming to market has fallen in recent quarters, and Moody's warns that this could potentially constrain market growth.</p><p>Following a surge in first-time sustainable bond issuers in 1H2021, when there was a global average of 77 debut sustainable bond issuers per month, the trend has reversed. New global first-time sustainable bond issuers totalled 51 average issuers per month throughout 2022, and the figure fell to 29 average issuers per month in 1H2023.</p><p>\"While some of the decline may be attributable to market conditions, other more secular factors could be holding back would-be debut issuers, including heightened scrutiny of potential greenwashing and an increasingly complex ESG regulatory and political landscape,\" says Moody's.</p><p>Energy transition, China to lead: JP Morgan</p><p>The same trend is seen within Asia ex-Japan, with GSSS bonds issued in G3 currencies down to US$19.7 billion in 1H2023, from US$32.7 billion in 1H2022, according to JP Morgan. Annualised 2023 numbers of approximately US$39.4 billion could mean an extended decline from 2021's heyday of US$70.6 billion and 2022's $48.2 billion.</p><p>That said, the share of GSSS bonds from total supply has remained somewhat stable in 1H2023 at 28.9% in Asia ex-Japan, down from 31.9% this time last year. \"This year has been challenging, primarily because interest rates have risen and there has been some volatility in the market globally, so supply is lower versus last year,\" says Puja Shah, JP Morgan's head of sustainable finance debt capital markets, Asia ex-Japan. \"But interestingly, ESG as a piece of the whole pie has remained broadly consistent as last year.\"</p><p>The energy transition will be a growth engine for GSSS bond issuance, with China in the lead, says JP Morgan in its 2023 mid-year review of ESG financing.</p><p>In 2022, green debt issuance exceeded fossil fuel debt issuance for the first time, according to JP Morgan. Green-labelled debt issuance reached US$581 billion in 2022, representing 7% of global debt issuance for the year, besting the US$531 billion issued by the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>Global investment in clean energy is on course to rise to US$1.7 trillion in 2023, with solar set to eclipse oil production for the first time, according to a May report by the International Energy Agency.</p><p>China is investing the most in energy transition globally; its annual investment grew at a CAGR of 22.1% between 2016 and 2022, higher than the US at 12.5% and Europe at 17.6%.</p><p>Within Asia ex-Japan, however, China's share of the GSSS bond market fell to 19% in 1H2023 from nearly 50% in 2022, as higher cost of borrowing has forced a large quantum of offshore financing to the China onshore bond market. Taking China's place so far this year has been South Korea, whose piece of the pie grew from 26% last year to 34% in 1H2023.</p><p>JP Morgan expects Asia bond supply to end the year at US$130 billion, with GSSS bonds forming at least 25%-30% of the G3 bond market. \"The pillars of the market would, of course, be the banks, sovereigns [and] some of the green renewable companies; they will continue to come to the market,\" says Shah.</p><p>Transition finance is gaining traction in Asia, says Shah, and with it comes greater scrutiny on the preparedness of issuers. \"[Targeting] net zero by 2050 is fine, but it's so far away that it's not as meaningful [as] providing targets for 2030.\"</p><p>Rules and taxonomies</p><p>But even the most well-intentioned issuers need a common language to justify their targets. Speaking on the sidelines of the International Capital Markets Association's (ICMA) 9th Annual Conference of the Principles on June 28, Shah emphasises the importance of taxonomies, which define criteria for economic activities that are aligned with decarbonisation targets. \"The Singapore-Asia Taxonomy and the development of other taxonomies are fantastic. They provide the right kind of tool for issuers to align to while also providing a local flavour.\"</p><p>Singapore's sustainable debt market grew \"healthily\" from about US$2 billion in 2018 to more than US$20 billion last year, says Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development, in her speech at the ICMA conference. The government will update the Singapore Green Bond Framework \"to align with the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for green activities\", she adds.</p><p>The next big focal point will be the interoperability of the world's taxonomies, says Shah. \"The EU taxonomy is a single taxonomy for the entire EU region, and Asia is a combination of several countries, which have different pathways of growth and development.\"</p><p>Regulators are well aware of the challenges, she adds. \"There is greater focus on promoting the development of credible GSSS issuance markets in Asia.\"</p><p>Sovereign GSSS bond issuances encourage local markets to follow, says Shah. The Philippines issued a US$750 million sustainability bond in October 2022 with a 5.95% coupon due 2047, while Hong Kong issued a multi-tranche green bond in January worth US$5.75 billion - the largest ESG bond issuance in Asia - and followed this up in May with an institutional green bond offering worth nearly US$6 billion.</p><p>Also in May, Indonesia issued the world's first ICMA-aligned sovereign blue bond, raising 20.7 billion yen ($190 million) at 1.2% and 1.43% coupon rates for seven- and 10-year tenures respectively.</p><p>The proceeds from this bond issuance will provide a much-needed boost to Indonesia's blue economy, says the United Nations Development Programme, including coastal protection, sustainable management of fisheries and aquaculture, marine biodiversity conservation and mangrove rehabilitation.</p><p>From a policy perspective, sovereigns want to develop a vibrant onshore market, says Shah. \"At the end of the day, Asian issuers will always have the ability to move between different financing options.

Impact financing can be one such area, with the Republic providing leadership and cultivating a deep pool of investors for opportunities in the wider region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Apart from businesses which set up regional headquarters here to expand in South-east Asia, Singapore has attracted many family offices from around the world due to its low taxes, political stability, excellent legal regime, security and financial prowess. There are currently more than 700 family offices in Singapore, including Dalio Family Office, Vulcan Capital, and those linked to James Dyson, hotpot chain Haidilao, Li Ka-shing and Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani.</p><p> Many of these family offices show support for impact and philanthropic investing, which has helped to build up an ecosystem here. According to the Global Impact Investing Network, many regional enterprises that have received impact investment are headquartered in Singapore, as are many private impact investors that operate across the region.</p><p> Meanwhile, South-east Asia has a large young population powering its economies, but faces growing environmental and social challenges brought about by climate change, population growth and urbanisation. Singapore is not insulated from the effects of climate change, and has made sustainability a national priority to address this. In particular, the public sector has set ambitious sustainability targets under the GreenGov.SG initiative, as part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. </p><p> In view of the above, there is a unique window of opportunity where Singapore can leverage its deep network of investors -- including pro-impact investing family offices -- and emerging technology capabilities to contribute to regional impact investing in education, food security, health, green infrastructure and environmental care.</p><p> Impact and philanthropic investors generally have the risk absorption capacities required to invest in nascent and disruptive technologies. Such investors in Singapore can play a pivotal role in cultivating a pool of future impact-investing unicorns in the Republic and South-east Asia. In the process, Singapore will be well positioned to become a regional hub for startups that are focused on impact investing, and eventually, the various ESG (environment, social, governance) causes.</p><p> One recent example of impact investment in Singapore was the stake taken by publicly listed Thai President Foods in Singapore foodtech startup Alchemy FoodTech. Alchemy Foodtech's patented Alchemy Fibre technology platform replaces sugars and carbohydrates in food to reduce their glycaemic index, while delivering \"great taste and texture\". In an article by TechNode Global, Thai President Foods shared that they were very excited to be one of the first Thai impact investors supporting startups, like Alchemy, that create a positive impact in society.</p><p> The Singapore Exchange (SGX) can be a listing platform for some regional impact investors to seek a partial or full exit. It can also help these investors gain credibility and visibility, as they seek collaborations or partnerships with strategic global impact investors who want to build their footprint in the region.</p><p> With a growing impact-investing community in Singapore, global impact investors which are already listed elsewhere can seek a secondary or dual listing on SGX to profile themselves in the Republic and the region, especially after acquiring target companies in impact investments in South-east Asia.</p><p>Singapore leads the region in venture capital investment and has been home to several unicorns. However, many tech startups in the region have chosen to list on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In a speech in 2021, Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong noted that one area in which Singapore can do better is making its public equity market more conducive for innovative growth companies. Having a vibrant home equity market becomes more pertinent as more Singapore impact investing startups mature and transform into regional and global players.</p><p> Education will be key to laying a strong foundation for an active and established impact and philanthropic investing ecosystem. Such education can provide updates on the more pressing environmental and social issues, show how technology can help address such issues, and explain how startups can seek impact and philanthropic investments.</p><p> For investors, education should include how to compare and select impact investment opportunities; how impact investing can enhance portfolio returns through diversification; and how impact investing can be a more transparent way to contribute to social causes, compared to monetary donations to charity.</p><p> Education should also cover how to organise and disclose information to assess the efficacy of impact investing. Singapore regulators themselves are actively addressing greenwashing issues by encouraging the market to enhance the quality of disclosures, and to allow access to more relevant impact investment information or data as well as promoting the consistency, comparability and integrity of such information.</p><p> To play an effective leadership role in impact investing in South-east Asia, Singapore should support the region through thought leadership; having a deep and wide pool of international impact investors and entrepreneurs to help find solutions to social and environmental challenges; and having a deep and sophisticated equity capital market where successful companies involved in impact investments may list.</p><p> Pei Sai Fan is an adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, as well as an angel investor and adviser to fintech startups.

Once, coal and other minerals made Hegang a pillar of socialist industry. When the richest seams were declared exhausted, just over a decade ago, the central government closed many mines and put its faith in green infrastructure. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Shanty towns of soot-blackened miners' huts were demolished and replaced with brightly painted apartment blocks, marching to the horizon beside new city parks. A high-speed rail line opened last December. There is proud talk of a graphite mine that will supply factories making batteries for new-energy vehicles. </p><p> Alas, for the technocrats, they could not prevent more than one in six locals leaving Hegang after 2010, fleeing low salaries, limited job prospects (especially for graduates) and long, dark, brutal winters. </p><p> Recently, that combination of a home-building drive and a shrinking population has propelled Hegang to an unforeseen distinction. It is, by some measures, China's cheapest city at prefecture level or above. </p><p> In 2019, Hegang earned online notoriety after young outsiders made viral videos and blog posts boasting of buying sizeable apartments there for as little as 46,000 yuan (S$8,900). The claim is supported by more formal surveys. Hegang's second-hand housing stock sells for 2,152 yuan per sq m on average, making property 40 times cheaper than in Shenzhen, a high-tech southern metropolis. </p><p> This backwater of 790,000 people near the Russian border has now become an online byword for a place where strivers -- as well as have-nots and misfits -- can turn modest savings into a home. </p><p> True, many give up and leave within months, often as winter temperatures plunge to minus 20 deg C. Others visit only briefly to decorate apartments bought online, before returning to lives in a factory dormitory as migrant workers in a giant eastern city. </p><p> But even that remote form of ownership is \"a form of emotional comfort\" for migrants, who may spend years in Shanghai or Guangzhou but have no hope of buying homes there, says Mr Liang Yunpeng, a Hegang estate agent. He sells perhaps 80 cheap flats a year to outsiders, typically on the upper floors of old buildings without lifts. His customers often have less than 30,000 yuan to spend. </p><p> It would be rash to predict Hegang's revival by incomers. Several successful new residents supplement local jobs by creating short online videos and posts that play on the novelty of their move to China's far north, earning millions of views for films about the cold or the cheapness of eating out. Only a limited number can become famous online for living in Hegang. </p><p> Still, this small city is a good place to observe a large trend. </p><p> China faces a cost-of-living crisis. Between 1998 and 2021, urban Chinese homes became four times less affordable, as judged by the ratio of average housing prices to median disposable incomes. </p><p> Today, a flat in Beijing measuring 100 sq m costs, on average, 6.3 million yuan, or about US$1 million. That is 34 times the average annual salary in China's capital. Unattainable housing is especially painful because property is seen as a safe, government-backed form of savings, and because a man without his own apartment will often struggle to find a wife. </p><p> It also exposes deep inequities in modern society. Some involve yawning income inequality. But others reflect encrusted privilege from the socialist era, notably after urban housing was privatised in the 1990s and sold off to state-employed workers and officials at steep discounts. </p><p> Visiting Hegang, The Economist meets the owner of a small burger bar, surnamed Hou. He is locally born, and returned from Beijing in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic halted his work as a guide taking Chinese tourists to Russia. Such holidays are not cheap: A family trip to Moscow might cost 30,000 yuan. Still, many of his clients were seemingly ordinary pensioners. </p><p> The explanation is that long-time Beijingers might own two or three apartments, bought cheaply years ago. Now, even a small flat can generate 60,000 yuan a year in rental income. In contrast, Mr Hou has noticed more Hegang friends heading home, after realising that -- as migrant outsiders to a big city -- they will never have enough capital to buy a home or start a business. He is glad to hear more customers or delivery-scooter riders with non-local accents, too. For one thing, such newcomers prop up Hegang housing prices. </p><p> Some locals resent Chinese bloggers who call the city a haven for those yearning to \"lie flat\", or drop out and abandon material ambitions. Mr Wang Dakai, who spent 10 years in big cities before returning to open a barber's shop, worries that Hegang is being called lazy. \"None of us is lying flat, everyone is hustling,\" he says. Proving his point, as his price for answering questions, he asks to film an online video pretending to cut his British visitor's hair to post on his social media channels. </p><p> Individual dreams in a  bastion of old collectivismSome fresh starts are life-changing. Buying and renovating a flat for 70,000 yuan last summer allowed a 25-year-old vlogger who uses the name \"Hua Hua\" to make a home for herself and her 10-year-old sister. Each month, she sends money to pay for her mentally impaired mother's care at home in Jiangxi province, 3,000km to the south. </p><p> She supports herself by selling pancakes and bean jelly from a street cart, house-sitting cats, working as an online customer service assistant and writing. Hegang is quiet and friendly, and has some good schools from its days as a mining centre, she says. </p><p> Also, she likes snow. </p><p> On a recent morning, she was joined in her tiny, cat-filled home by a newly arrived friend, a divorced single mother. The friend has noticed that many arrivals have strained relations with families, as she does. </p><p> No central planner set out to make Hegang a city where young women can enjoy rare autonomy, without a husband or relatives to control them. </p><p> This cheap former mining town is best understood as an accidental safety valve. Its startling fame reveals that Chinese society is a system under terrible pressure. </p><p> (C) 2023 THE ECONOMIST NEWSPAPER LIMITED.

Today is the day we welcome newly minted Professional Engineers (PEs), Specialist PEs and ASEAN Chartered PEs into our Built Environment sector family. It is also the occasion to affirm the contributions and achievements of our PEs, and for PEs to renew your passion for engineering, and your dedication to this meaningful profession.</p><p>Role and Contributions of PEs</p><p>2. Singapore's rapid transformation from a backwater of crowded tenements to a vibrant metropolis is attributable in no small part to our dedicated engineers.</p><p>3. The engineers have been at the forefront of every phase of our development. In the 1960s, housing shortage and urban renewal were of top priority. When the pioneer generation had to build homes rapidly to relocate people from crowded squatter settlements to HDB public housing, the engineers were there.</p><p>4. In the 1970s and 1980s, we needed city development to generate economic growth and jobs. When we built up our city centre and established a comprehensive transport network to support growth and development, the engineers were there.</p><p>5. In the 2000s, our development took on a global dimension. With increased international competition for talent and investment, we needed to rise beyond national development and become a cosmopolitan global city. When we took Singapore to the next level of a global city with state-of-the-art infrastructure and made it a destination of choice, to live, work and play, the engineers were also there.</p><p>6. Throughout the transformation journey, our engineers demonstrated high levels of professionalism and ethics. Your unwavering commitment to safety gave us confidence and peace of mind in the knowledge that our homes, workplaces and public spaces are safe, liveable and workable.</p><p>7. Your creativity and ingenuity enabled us to overcome our limited land and resources, and turned these constraints into opportunities. Some notable engineering accomplishments in Singapore include the Marina Coastal Expressway, Singapore's first undersea tunnel; Changi Jewel and its distinctive domed faade and 40-metre tall indoor waterfall that has earned international acclamation; and our Tuas Mega Port which has just recently opened last year. The Tuas Mega Port will reinforce Singapore's status as a leading international maritime centre, and will free up prime land for development of the Greater Southern Waterfront.</p><p>8. Through your efforts, Singapore is today a leader in urban development and our transformation is now a source of inspiration to others.</p><p>Engineering Our Tomorrow</p><p>9. Now as we build our Singapore of tomorrow, we will once again need our engineers.</p><p>10. The ForwardSG Report launched by DPM Wong last month is our roadmap to the future. A key theme we have heard is that Singaporeans want Singapore to continue to be a liveable city. This means that we will need to carefully balance land needs for economic development, public housing, as well as green and recreational spaces for today and tomorrow.</p><p>11. The professional services under the Built Environment sector will play an increasingly important role in building our future city. This includes finding new solutions and ways of building to overcome our limited land and environmental resources, as well as forming new partnerships with stakeholders within and outside the sector. Our professional services also need to transform and keep up with changing times so as to capture new opportunities.</p><p>12. One of the greatest and most pressing challenge of building Singapore for tomorrow is climate change. Climate change is an existential threat for humanity as a whole, but especially so for Singapore. As a low-lying city-state, we are vulnerable to rising sea levels. We are also already experiencing rising temperatures, compounded by our densely built-up environment. Climate change also poses risks to our food and water security, public health, and biodiversity.</p><p>13. We will have to build future Singapore in way that goes far beyond our current levels of sustainability. In order to achieve our net zero ambitions, we will once again have to call on our engineers to rise to the occasion.</p><p>14. Let me touch on two areas in which good engineering will make all the difference.</p><p>Coastal Protection</p><p>15. First, coastal protection. Singapore is a low-lying island, and 30% of our land area is less than 5 metres above the mean sea level. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore estimates that the mean sea level around Singapore could rise by up to 1 metre by 2100. Combined with extreme rainfall and storm surges, there could be serious impacts on our infrastructure, our community and our livelihoods.</p><p>16. PUB has already commenced site-specific studies for different parts of our coastlines to understand their characteristics and develop targeted coastal protection measures. They will share more about these efforts and their progress later.</p><p>17. As we work to protect against rising sea levels, there will be abundant opportunities for engineers to be involved in the design, implementation and maintenance of our coastal protection measures. This includes considering how coastal protection can be integrated with other social and recreational uses. An example of such an engineering marvel is Marina Barrage which is multi-functional. It is not only used for flood control, but also serves Singapore as a vital water source and at the same time is a lifestyle attraction.</p><p>18. We will need engineering expertise in fields such as soil mechanics, flood management and environmental hydraulics, to name just a few. Protecting Singapore against rising sea levels will require a pipeline of engineering talent over the long term. The Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI) Singapore is dedicated to strengthening local capabilities and expertise in coastal protection and flood management. CFI Singapore offers a wide range of programmes, such as workforce training programmes and scientific seminars to drive collaboration across the industry.</p><p>19. I encourage all of you today to consider some of these programmes, and equip yourselves or your employees with the skills and knowledge to contribute to this important effort.</p><p>Decarbonising our Built Environment</p><p>20. Another key area is decarbonising our built environment. Today, buildings account for around 20% of Singapore's carbon emissions and more than a third of electricity consumption. Reducing our buildings' carbon emissions and building net-zero cities is an imperative if we are to achieve net zero emissions globally by mid-century to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>21. Under the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, we have set three ambitious targets, or \"80-80-80 in 2030\", to green our buildings. These are to green 80% of our buildings by 2030, for 80% of our new developments to meet Super Low energy (or SLE) standards from 2030, and for our best-in-class buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency from 2005 levels by 2030. We have seen promising progress on all of these targets but must continue to sustain this momentum.</p><p>22. I seek your support and your expertise in furthering our green building efforts. For example, as engineers, you can support our efforts to mainstream SLE buildings by challenging and moving away from conventional building design. This could involve designing for more spaces to be naturally ventilated, adopting hybrid cooling solutions and deploying rooftop and faade photovoltaics to maximise renewable energy that is harnessed onsite.</p><p>23. To do this work, I encourage you to build up your knowledge and expertise. The BCA Academy offers training courses for Built Environment professionals to increase their green building expertise. These courses cover areas such as lifecycle carbon analysis, solar modelling and energy performance modelling.</p><p>24. As engineers, you have a direct hand in building a more resilient, lower-carbon built environment. Your engineering efforts and innovations will also enable Singapore to harness sustainability as a competitive advantage and position Singapore as a sustainability hub, one where innovative and cost-effective green engineering solutions can be catalysed, developed and then exported to the region and the world.</p><p>25. Next year, Infrastructure Asia will be organising the Asia Infrastructure Forum (AIF) in June. Infrastructure Asia's role is to be a platform that connects supply and demand in infrastructure, and it provides an opportunity for our Built Environment professionals to connect with those in the infrastructure space regionally. The multilateral development banks, international companies and those who have an interest in infrastructure will be there. So I would strongly encourage PEB members to attend the AIF next year. We are looking to see if we can organise a panel discussion on professional services, in order to have sustainable infrastructure. It is something that should be quite interesting because there are leaders all over the world that will come to discuss this, and I am sure that all of you will have something very meaningful to contribute to the discussion, given Singapore's efforts in sustainability.</p><p>Recognising outstanding PEs</p><p>26. Today, we want to recognise two outstanding PEs, Er. Wong Seng and Er. Ng Choon Yeang, whose engineering innovations have led to improvements in productivity and environmental outcomes.</p><p>27. Er. Wong is the Managing Director of TW-Asia Consultants Pte Ltd. He is being recognised today for his pioneering innovation in concrete prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (or PPVC) technology using a composite shear wall system.</p><p>28. The technology involves a LEGO-like construction method where PPVC modules of the same floor are joined side-by-side, and then floor-by-floor. This innovation has not only enabled significant productivity improvements, but it also boasts many other advantages. For example, the use of thin PPVC composite walls means more usable room space. There are also notable environmental benefits such as the reduction of noise and dust pollution at the project site given that most of the construction activity is completed off-site.</p><p>29. The second recipient of the Innovative PE Award is Er. Ng Choon Yeang, Deputy Group Director for Rail Infrastructure and Expansion at LTA. He is being recognised for pioneering the use of Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) for the Downtown Line 3's tunnel segments. While SFRC is traditionally used in Singapore for non-structural components, Er. Ng spearheaded studies to test and implement SFRC for permanent tunnel segments in our underground rail.</p><p>30. The success of its use in Downtown Line 3 has led to the extensive use of SFRC in LTA's subsequent MRT tunnelling works such as the Thomson East Coast Line and the Cross Island Line. Compared to the use of traditional steel bar reinforced concrete for other MRT projects, the use of SFRC has improved productivity for segment production by up to 25%, resulting in cost savings. The maintenance required is also lower as SFRC segments are more resistant to corrosion and fire damage.</p><p>31. I thank Er. Wong and Er. Ng for their innovative and can-do spirit. In the face of global challenges like climate change and increasing resource scarcity, innovation will be critical for new solutions and pathways towards a more sustainable future.</p><p>32. On this note, I encourage our engineering firms to tap on Government grants to spur innovation in your areas of work, and to drive your business transformation plans. For example, Enterprise Singapore's Enterprise Development Grant provides funding support to local companies to upgrade, innovate, grow and transform your business. The grant also supports the development of innovative technology and products with the end goal of commercialisation.</p><p>33. ESG's Enterprise Financing Scheme - Green (or EFS Green) also helps local companies access financing for sustainability-related initiatives, including the development of technologies and solutions for green infrastructure.</p><p>34. Engineering firms with ideas that push the boundaries of building energy efficiency can also consider tapping on the Green Building Innovation Cluster Programme 2.0 where up to 70% of qualifying costs will be supported.</p><p>35. I think I have spoken long enough. Let me conclude by sending my warmest congratulations to the newly registered PEs, Specialist PEs and ASEAN Chartered PEs, as well as the award recipients today.</p><p>36. To our engineers in the room, we owe so much of what we enjoy today - our quality housing and our efficient transportation systems - to all of you. Thank you for doing what you do.</p><p>37. The challenges ahead also present new and exciting opportunities in the field of engineering. Building our future Singapore is something we cannot do without you, so the 4G team and I look forward to building our future Singapore with you. Thank you all very much.</p><p>[Category: Construction &amp; Materials, Engineering &amp; Construction, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["The grant also supports the development of innovative technology and products with the end goal of commercialisation. 33. 34.

On the last day of Ecosperity Week 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the financial industry announced they would establish the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA). The SSFA will initially focus on initiatives to scale voluntary carbon markets, transition finance and blended finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) is leading the coordination and set-up of the SSFA. According to MAS, the SSFA will include representatives from financial institutions, financial industry associations, relevant corporates and service providers, such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating agencies.</p><p>Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, also chairman of MAS, says he does not see carbon taxes \"coming in time\" to meet global net-zero targets. \"If we don't have carbon taxes rising to adequate levels globally, without lots of free-riders, [then] we need financial regulation as a major public policy tool, and we must use it. Otherwise, the markets will be too slow.\"</p><p>Many of our banks are taking a forward-looking view, says Tharman, but there is \"a lot of unevenness\". \"The leading banks and financial institutions have to be provided clear guidance, so none of them has to move ahead of the rest and feel [a] competitive disadvantage. That's why we need guidance across the board.\"</p><p>The government is exploring how to develop a new vehicle to catalyse blended finance in Asia by working with regional partners, says Tharman. This ranges from collaborating with government agencies to Singapore-based infrastructure financing vehicles like Clifford Capital and Pentagreen Capital, as well as commercial banks and multilateral development banks like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, he adds.</p><p>Along with other government agencies, MAS says it is collaborating with industry players to explore platforms to channel blended finance at scale into transition and green infrastructure projects in the region. \"MAS aims to bring together patient, concessionary capital from philanthropies, multilateral development banks, development finance institutions and donor partners. This will help crowd more conventional infrastructure financiers, including banks and institutional investors.\" MAS says further details will be announced, \"when the plans are more developed\".</p><p>Compared to the jam-packed conferences of years past, this year's edition - which wrapped on June 8 - was a quieter affair, until the end. Tharman, who gave the keynote address at the inaugural Financing Asia's Transition (Fast) Conference - held as part of Ecosperity Week 2023 - announced his intention to quit politics after the close of the main event on June 8.</p><p>He will resign from the People's Action Party and step down from his ministerial posts on July 7, to run for president in the upcoming election.</p><p>Private sector and climate resilience</p><p>There are US$7 trillion ($9.4 trillion) worth of benefits on the table if private sectors invest in climate resilience by 2030, but at this moment, only 7% of investments are channelled into adaptation and resilience, says Lauren Sorkin, executive director of the Resilient Cities Network.</p><p>At the same time, more than half the world's emissions come from Asia. This makes the region a core part of the problem and the solution, says Isabel Chatterton of the International Finance Corporation (IFC).</p><p>Panellists at Ecosperity Week agree that public-private partnerships have a huge potential in tackling net zero but cite the same hurdles in realising such collaboration.</p><p>Those in the financial sector looking to fund nature-based climate solutions say such ventures are still too risky, as there needs to be a consistent, comparable metric to link physical climate with financial risk. While there have been successful examples of using nature-based solutions to solve climate issues in cities, the industry needs more concrete data points to prove a solid business case for investing, say experts.</p><p>While there is much interest in funding new green technologies, the bigger challenge is getting money to flow into emerging markets and then scaling those solutions, which require much more capital, says Temasek chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani. He believes it boils down to stable regulatory policies and frameworks that can mitigate risks and give investors the confidence that what is being done can be delivered.</p><p>But not all governments have been completely transparent or open to adopting nature-based climate solutions, says Zoe Knight, group head of the centre of sustainable finance at HSBC. She says there are still difficulties in ironing out frameworks without more transparency from policymakers on how they might want to implement resilience and adaptation through nature-based solutions and ecosystem services.</p><p>William McGoldrick, regional managing director for The Nature Conservancy's Asia-Pacific division, says there is a \"bias, or some sort of psychological barrier to even begin thinking [of] or taking it seriously\". The goal is incredibly difficult, \"like trying to fix a Rubik's cube\", Claire Perry O'Neill offers. The former UK Minister for Energy and Clean Growth adds that the world cannot wait for a perfect solution to achieve zero-carbon cities. Instead, all players must experiment very quickly with different models at small city levels, which will eventually cascade into the future, says O'Neill, the sustainability advisor for Singapore-headquartered climate-tech venture Terrascope.</p><p>Fellow panellist Wang Tianyi, the former chairman of China Everbright Environment Group, summarises the partnership between public and private sectors, describing it as \"a lasting marriage, not a short wedding ceremony\".</p><p>Jakarta's big move</p><p>Without major policy announcements this year, much of the buzz at the conference came from Indonesia's leaders who attended in person. President Joko Widodo was the conference's headliner, and his speech on June 7 started light-heartedly: \"I would like to take the opportunity to ask you: Who will win next year's Presidential election?\" The 61-year-old will end his second and final five-year term in 2024.</p><p>Around the time Joko leaves office, Indonesia hopes to complete the first phase of its new capital city Nusantara in East Kalimantan, Borneo. About three times the size of Singapore, the project was announced three years ago and is reportedly estimated to cost IDR466 trillion ($42 billion). Joko started the project in his second term. The pilot stage is due for completion in August 2024.</p><p>Indonesia's government has committed to finance 20% of the project but will need other investors to fund the balance. Japan's SoftBank pulled out of the project in March 2022. \"Your investment in Indonesia will continue to be safe and also the continuity of the Nusantara new capital city,\" says Joko. \"Everything will be fine, don't worry.\"</p><p>His 11-minute speech and a separate panel discussion between Nusantara project chairman Bambang Susantono and Bloomberg's Haslinda Amin were dedicated to showcasing the new capital city's investment potential.</p><p>Bambang says five countries are in a \"serious due diligence process\" to invest in Nusantara: South Korea, Japan, China, Germany and the United Arab Emirates. Joko announced in July 2022 that South Korea has agreed to pledge a total investment of US$6.37 billion.</p><p>A first look at the new capital city may be ready next August, but Nusantara will only be fully complete by 2045, and Indonesia aims to house 1.9 million residents there. Between now and then, governments, laws and even the constitution will be changed, says Haslinda. How can Indonesia ensure the project reaches completion?</p><p>Bambang replies: \"The owner of the city is the one that moved there. The city's owner is the one that [is] also doing a lot of business there.\" He adds that investors of all sizes, even micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, will be the city's owners. \"They will be the one[s] that guarantee the city's sustainability in the future.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Singapore", "instances": ["The government is exploring how to develop a new vehicle to catalyse blended finance in Asia by working with regional partners, says Tharman.

Nonetheless, more can be done to drive home the message. This may include deeper engagement and education to help FIs appreciate that financing a company with a high carbon footprint will soon be no less acceptable than banking with one that fails basic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules. This will create a stronger impetus for FIs to lend their influence to redirect more capital to sustainability-focused projects.One key lever will be using a mix of public and private finance, especially for marginally bankable green projects. Blended finance structures such as multi-layered investment vehicles, social bonds and blended guarantees can help provide additional investor \"patience\" for longer payback periods than more traditional investments. Public funds and development guarantees can also help reduce risks to encourage private capital participation.Green bonds are also a key instrument, and the government has an important role to play in facilitating access to them. Sustainable bond issuers would welcome an extension of Singapore's Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme beyond its current validity of May 31, 2023. This scheme offsets up to S$100,000 of additional expenses for external reviews of eligible green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds and promotes adoption of internationally accepted standards. Lowering its minimum issuance size from the current S$200 million would also bring in more issuers. Singapore is also developing its ESG ecosystem to accelerate sustainable and green financing for the country, and as a regional and global hub. For instance, the government is supporting provision of ESG data platforms and services to help fill gaps in the data required to make funding and risk pricing decisions, while keeping the costs of providing green financing down. This is driving the development of sustainable financing in new customer segments, such as small- and medium-size enterprises (which account for 48 per cent of Singapore's GDP), and financial services, such as sustainable supply chain financing, and sustainability-linked short-term working capital lending.The government could further encourage FIs into the green arena through a tax concession on interest income from green bonds or loans. For example, a 5 or 10 per cent concessionary corporate tax rate could be provided on interest income from loans used to fund the acquisition and \"greening\" of older properties.Exploring asset recycling and alternate funding optionsAsean countries are realising the urgency of shifting from brownfield infrastructure such as fossil-fuel power plants to the likes of wind and solar energy. Singapore's geographic position at the nexus of regional logistics, pipelines, and power grid infrastructure makes it a valuable base from which FIs can reach such markets. KPMG's new Asean Decarbonisation Hub is offering expertise across the region for capacity building and financial structuring, bringing together government and private actors to accelerate decarbonisation efforts.This can help to generate greater financial and environmental value by promoting a strategic and programmatic approach to monetising brownfield assets in capital markets. Establishing an Energy Transition Mechanism fund could further mobilise capital for asset recycling. For example, numerous ageing fossil-fuel plants could be bundled together using grants and commercial financing in order to buy down their cost. This will help to bring in private sector innovation, investment and efficiencies to operate, or early-retire ageing infrastructure, freeing up public capital for other decarbonisation projects.New advances in energy technology are paving the way for South-east Asia's shift from fossil fuels; Singapore should now position itself to provide the innovative financing to unlock these opportunities at scale.The writers are partners with KPMG in Singapore.

Climate change, as described by the United Nations, has become the greatest threat to human security, and has evolved beyond just an environmental problem. Sustainability has grown to become an increasingly urgent focus for businesses, with many implementing a \"triple bottom line\" framework \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which integrates social, environmental, and financial outcomes to evaluate sustainability.There has been a surge in eco-conscious investors in the Asia Pacific region, with 70 per cent claiming sustainability is a significant factor in their investment strategy, compared to 57 per cent just a year ago. Sustainability also influences consumers' purchasing decisions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 60 per cent of consumers globally rate it as an important purchase criterion.Businesses can no longer get away with being oblivious to the impact they have on the environment and communities they operate in, nor should they delay implementing sustainable practices to mitigate them. </p><p>This extends not only to large enterprises, but to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who make up the overwhelming majority of businesses worldwide.Oftentimes however, many SMEs lack the fundamental information or guidance on how to successfully implement environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. According to UOB's SME Outlook Study 2022, 3 in 5 small businesses in Singapore agree with the importance of incorporating sustainable practices in their businesses, but remain unsure of how to start.Using energy-efficient office equipment, recycling materials, or going paperless are small wins that SMEs can make regardless of where they are on their sustainability journey. For some small businesses, sustainability additionally inspires and drives product innovation. gush, a local Singaporean company specialising in sustainable paints and advanced building materials, invented a paint that transforms walls into passive air purifiers. Their products are odourless and have anti-mould, anti-bacterial and humidity-regulating properties.The founders both suffered from childhood asthma, exacerbated by the annual haze season. This shared experience inspired them to find a way to improve air quality indoors, and make spaces healthier for building occupants. Another brand making a difference in the world is Luxe Botanics. The beauty brand invested over 18 months on research and development to launch its line of all-natural, cruelty-free and and highly efficacious skincare products. The brand also opts for eco-friendly packaging, minimising the use of plastic, and their products are free from animal- or petrochemical-derived ingredients and synthetic fragrances. Working with partners that share the same sustainability ethos can be an easy initial step. Xero is one such partner, committed to making a positive impact on the environment and societies it operates in and assisting small businesses to meet their sustainability goals.Xero achieved carbon neutrality in 2021 and has further committed to various ESG initiatives to support local businesses and communities, including providing SMEs with sustainability guides and resources, as well as offering charities and non-profit organisations 25 per cent off their subscription fees.

The initial momentum was fuelled by positive surprise around the pace of China's post-Covid re-opening, macro data and return of investment flows into the Hong Kong/China markets. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Northbound inflows via the Hong Kong-China Stock Connect into the China A-share bourses rose to a record US$20.88 billion last month, which is US$6 billion above the previous monthly record in December 2021. </p><p> With the sharp rally in Hong Kong/China equities, can this investor optimism and momentum carry on? We articulate two key reasons why the equity market revival is in its early phase, and how investing in China has changed course after the bruising experience of 2022.</p><p> 1. Upside economic surpriseSince China's abrupt zero-Covid policy reversal in November 2022, public health officials estimated that herd immunity has been achieved. Activity data in China has rebounded more sharply compared to other economies like India and Taiwan. Over the Chinese New Year holidays, national domestic tourism traffic and revenues were back to 89 per cent and 73 per cent of 2019 pre-pandemic levels, respectively. </p><p> A stronger than anticipated fourth quarter 2022 gross domestic product (GDP) prompted Bank of Singapore to raise our forecast for China's 2023 GDP growth from 4.5 per cent to 5.2 per cent, rebounding from 3 per cent growth in 2022. </p><p> China's policymakers are re-focusing on economic growth priorities in 2023, after addressing leadership transition and regulatory issues last year. We expect a broadly supportive stance across fiscal and industrial policies to reboot growth in 2023, as well as policy follow-ups from the key priorities announced at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) last year. </p><p> These will aim to boost domestic demand; accelerate industrial development, support public and private enterprises; boost foreign investment and manage economic and financial risks.</p><p> 2. Attractive set-up of fundamentalsUltimately, valuations of Chinese equities will need to be supported by earnings growth and fundamentals. Leading indicators of corporate profitability, such as manager surveys, are turning positive, and broadly signal an inflection point for earnings of Chinese companies. We believe that the stage is set for a sustainable bull market in Hong Kong and China equities in 2023, as we start from a relatively low base in terms of earnings expectations. </p><p> In particular, we favour sectors such as consumer, technology, renewables, green infrastructure and electric vehicles. These are areas exposed to the cyclical recovery that accompanies China's reopening, as well as sectors exposed to structural themes that will benefit from policy tailwinds in areas of economic development. </p><p> However, we expect near-term volatility as investors may tactically take profit, given the sharp rally year-to-date. We also caution that the overall investment thesis for global investors has been scarred after the bruising experiences of the past year. </p><p> The unwelcome mix of zero-Covid policies, regulatory and policy risks, as well as US-China geopolitical risks that caused sharp market corrections may have impacted the modus operandi for investors in China. </p><p> PositioningHow should investors be positioned to re-enter the China market'</p><p> 1) Watch the geopolitical risks: Relations between the United States and China are fraught with immense complexity as tensions between both sides ebb and rise. A recent illustration: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's previously scheduled meeting with his counterpart China Foreign Minister Qin Gang revived hopes that ties were set to improve. This has been dashed following the recent appearance and subsequent shooting down of a Chinese balloon flying across North America. </p><p> Such events weigh on Hong Kong/China markets, as investors actively price in greater downside risks should conflicts escalate. On the other hand, these episodes also help to create attractive entry points for well-prepared investors armed with rigorous analysis, sufficient dry powder and sufficiently long-term horizons. </p><p> 2) Increase in risk premium: The rise in volatility due to geopolitical and policy uncertainties weigh on investors' risk appetite for investing in China. Hence, investors may demand a higher rate of return going forward. Investors should also focus on higher quality companies in terms of their business models, earnings power and resilience amid global economic uncertainty and recessionary risks.</p><p> 3) Portfolio diversification across sectors and industries: While China's equity indices are skewed towards large-cap sectors such as technology and financials, the experience of the past two years has demonstrated the idiosyncratic risks of being overly exposed to individual sectors and companies. This was the case with China's property, after-school education and Internet platform sectors. </p><p> 4) Beneficiaries of China's economic recovery: In addition to direct beneficiaries, companies in the US, Europe and Asia are also potential investment candidates for investors seeking exposure to China's recovery. These include sectors that benefit from China travel and consumption trends, as well as global manufacturers as global supply chain linkages normalise. </p><p> Global impactOn the flip side, we are watchful of the global impact of China's re-opening on commodity prices and the complications it could pose for the Federal Reserve's inflation fight. </p><p> We remain overall neutral in our equities positioning, with an overweight position in Asia ex-Japan offsetting an underweight position in Europe. Within Asia, we remain constructive on markets across China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.</p><p> We continue to be broadly cautious of credit, as expressed through our underweight position in developed markets high yield (HY) bonds. In emerging markets, we are neutral on both investment grade and HY given the overall neutral risk-reward in terms of pricing and fundamentals. Bottom-up credit selection in this space remains key. </p><p> After journeying through a period of trying conditions, China's time in the sun has finally arrived. A mix of macro, regulatory, valuation and positioning tailwinds make Chinese markets increasingly attractive to global investors once again. </p><p> Investors are now keenly aware that there remain areas where extra vigilance is needed, such as geopolitical risks. </p><p> However, there are ample opportunities in China, especially compared to the challenging investment landscape for a number of major developed markets this year. </p><p> The writer is chief investment officer and head of portfolio management and research office, Bank of Singapore.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Leading indicators of corporate profitability, such as manager surveys, are turning positive, and broadly signal an inflection point for earnings of Chinese companies.

Technology is a powerful enabler. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We speak to the experts about the opportunities in climate-related tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Q: What is the opportunity set in climate tech for investors, and what types of innovation are most promising? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Xiaying Zhang: We believe the market opportunity for mitigation- and adaptation-related climate solutions is enormous and necessary. While some individuals and companies may be willing to make trade-offs for more climate-friendly solutions, it is unlikely that society will accept trade-offs at the scale needed. People are unlikely to stop travelling and consuming, and businesses are unlikely to stop producing. </p><p> Regulation will be essential, but ultimately, solutions will need to be market-driven and stand on their own to be truly scalable.</p><p> The range of investable climate solutions continues to broaden and expand. We continue to see declining costs and increased market adoption in areas such as renewables and electric vehicles (EVs), and this is likely to ramp up over time with ongoing scientific and technological innovation -- for example, advances in solar materials and battery technology.</p><p> Regarding adaptation, improved near-term weather and longer-term climate forecasting should help companies adjust their operations in real time to account for extreme weather events and to incorporate future climate risks into long-term asset planning. Parametric weather insurance is emerging as a way for businesses and consumers to hedge their revenue or asset risk around weather-related risks. </p><p> Together, these combine into a wide range of potentially high-return, high-impact opportunities, particularly within growth-stage climate-tech companies.</p><p> We also think several secular trends support disruptive climate-focused entrepreneurs. For example, as the list of countries and corporations committed to net-zero emissions grows, we expect high levels of global infrastructure spend, creating a foundation for innovative, asset-light companies to build on. </p><p> In addition, consumers are demanding transparency and choices that match their climate-related values, and companies are in search of innovation that can help them meet that demand. </p><p> In our view, this creates an enormous opportunity for innovations and technology that address climate change while delivering a superior user experience without trade-offs. We see all of this reflected in the growth of climate-related investments across public and private markets.</p><p> Rachel Teo: Based on the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 report -- which sets out a pathway for the global energy sector to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 -- the investable opportunity until 2050 in the scenario where net zero is indeed achieved by mid-century is approximately US$126 trillion, or US$4.2 trillion a year over the next 30 years. </p><p> However, even in a Stated Policies Scenario, as the IEA calls it, there is still significant momentum behind green solutions because of favourable conditions -- such as existing and committed climate actions by governments, and the fall in climate change-related technology costs. </p><p> The opportunity set for investors when it comes to technology solutions that aid the transition lies both within transition assets and green solutions providers. </p><p> The former focuses on supporting high-carbon businesses that are credibly transitioning towards low-carbon business models, while the latter is about funding companies that are providing decarbonisation solutions for transitioning businesses and the economy at large. In both categories, the opportunity set for investors is broad -- spanning public and private markets and across the full capital structure.</p><p> Among six sectors that climate technologies can be categorised into (such as electricity, transport, buildings, industrial processes, low-emission fuels, and agriculture, forestry and other land use), electricity and transport represent the largest investment opportunities. </p><p> Some technological solutions are already well established, such as solar and wind. But many are still nascent or early-stage, such as direct air capture (DAC), green hydrogen and nuclear fusion. </p><p> While we do see many promising innovations, GIC's investment decisions are based on value creation and returns, including factors such as attractive risk-reward proposition and a good path to commercialisation. </p><p> At GIC, we invest across both the entire technology spectrum and various stages of a company's growth because of our long-term orientation, flexible capital, and multi-asset portfolio. Our investments range from private equity (in technologies such as carbon capture or green steel) to infrastructure (in a company building EV charging infrastructure) to public equity (in an environmental, social and governance or ESG data provider), to debt financing (for companies working on geothermal energy solutions). This breadth allows us not only to invest in multiple innovative solutions, but also to support firms at various stages of development.</p><p> Mathieu Forcioli: As a bank, we have a leading role to play in mobilising the transition to net zero by supporting our customers in their own transition to lower emissions. This involves helping companies access sustainable finance and expertise, and investing in climate solutions in collaboration with our partners and investors all over the world to scale up new technologies and approaches at pace.</p><p> The global race to net zero presents an opportunity for investors, such as opening up new asset classes and products targeting, for example, technology and green infrastructure. At this stage, however, it is estimated that around half the technologies needed to meet the challenge are not yet commercially deployable and require rapid scaling-up. </p><p> To date, the major focus in terms of decarbonisation has been low-carbon power generation, but we know this will not be enough to meet targets. Reducing emissions in the transport sector is another focal point, helping to drive substantial disruption in the auto and mobility industries from new competitors and technologies. </p><p> Therefore, one pertinent theme for investors today is \"future transport\". The IEA estimates that 6 per cent of cumulative emission reductions in 2021-2050 could be achieved by using hydrogen-based fuels. Globally, government policy is driving both infrastructure development and vehicle transition via fuel standards, emission targets and incentives. Major vehicle manufacturers are accelerating their push to launch zero-carbon electric truck models, based both on battery and hydrogen fuel cell drivetrain technologies. </p><p> And, more broadly, the convergence of mobility and technology underscores the structural importance of semiconductors and software. This is an exciting opportunity for investors. </p><p> Cutting-edge, smart technologies and tech-based solutions can also help preserve nature, thereby indirectly contributing to net-zero emissions. </p><p> We see many compelling examples of this, such as the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to convert food waste into insect-based animal feed, thereby helping reduce waste, carbon emissions and deforestation, and the use of agricultural methane detection technology to help cut emissions, reverse forest loss and regenerate biodiversity. </p><p> In addition, the application of financial technology to the climate change challenge is bringing new investment solutions and opportunities to the VC space, which are all important in the transition towards net-zero emissions.</p><p> Q: Venture capital is an avenue for investors to get exposure to climate tech. What are some of the challenges investors face when investing in climate tech'</p><p> Zhang: The climate crisis represents a useful example whereby many venture-stage companies are developing new technologies, which may play a key role in helping every sector of the economy transform by reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency, and making global energy supply more sustainable. </p><p> At the same time, investors should not overlook that investing in these more illiquid private companies comes with specific risks. Therefore, this is only appropriate for investors who can take a long-term approach, as exiting an investment in the event of financial or sustained underperformance may be difficult. Moreover, transparency and governance may be more limited compared to investments in publicly listed companies. </p><p> Overall, some of these management teams may have less experience with public shareholder scrutiny and engagement than existing public companies.</p><p> Investors need to ensure that the investee companies ultimately deliver real-world solutions in the fight against climate change -- meaning the rigorous measurement of actual impact is critical when identifying and monitoring investments.</p><p> However, impact measurement in private markets -- particularly in VC -- has specific considerations, including data availability and uncertainty, given that many of these companies are innovators and disrupters aiming to transform the industry. </p><p> Further, if the investment thesis involves an innovative company with a new, first-to-market solution that is expected to be widely adopted, it is important to consider both the individual company and the potential ecosystem change.</p><p> Teo: Given the early-stage nature of venture investing, there are many challenges for investors, particularly in evaluating the technology and the commercialisation risk. For some climate technologies, the solutions are still pre-commercialisation or scale-up. These require significant upfront capital and potentially years of research before any revenue is generated. </p><p> In some cases, there may be significant asset management requirements to help company management teams develop business strategy, support growth, and monitor performance. For investors, the bar for domain expertise to be able to evaluate opportunities is thus very high.</p><p> Additionally, business models may not be proven yet, and investors face significant uncertainties regarding the supporting ecosystem or infrastructure, including policies and regulations. </p><p> The upshot, however, is that a climate tech startup which successfully achieves commercialisation is likely to have deeper competitive moats, making it tougher for competitors to replicate its products.</p><p> Climate technology presents unique organisational challenges for investors. As climate tech covers a wide range of sectors and markets, investment teams require broad-based sector and regional experience. Furthermore, a long-term mindset is required to understand the full value of climate-tech solutions, as well as patience to support companies in their scaling-up. </p><p> The climate-tech ecosystem is a quickly evolving one, with new companies having the potential to disrupt incumbents. Engaging early in this space in a considered and controlled manner allows GIC to understand the evolution of these promising technologies and better discern the winners. All investments, however, still carry risks. We look at these very carefully, put them through our stringent investment due diligence process, and subject them to risk controls which include starting with small investments and scaling up only when investments are sufficiently de-risked.</p><p> Forcioli: By some estimates, over a quarter of all VC funding goes into climate technology, with strong growth over the last decade. Still, the amounts we are speaking about represent a fraction of total flows into private equity and VC, and fluctuate each year, which may impact the sustainability and growth of the climate-tech ecosystem. Thus, challenges remain along the road to fulfilling the climate objective. </p><p> For example, while the long-term nature of private market investments lends itself to investing in technology, the illiquid nature of the investment and the uncertainty of cash flow generation later in life may suit a smaller pool of investors from a risk-return perspective. </p><p> Factor in the time and risk involved in research and development -- and, in many cases, a fund's lack of track record -- and it is reasonable to see how this combination of longer time frames and unproven technology does not work for many VC investors, who typically want to see returns in five to seven years. On top of this, investors can find it challenging to monitor impact outcomes or assess the alignment of sustainability objectives to a portfolio company or fund manager due to a lack of benchmarks and data, which makes reporting and disclosure more difficult.</p><p> But with challenges come opportunities. We see promising structural growth opportunities in clean energy and green technologies, including in innovations in solar, wind and hydrogen power, EVs, and green infrastructure such as flood walls which increase resilience of urban areas to natural disasters. Nature-based solutions in \"climate smart\" city planning can benefit city dwellers, reduce the carbon footprint and promote biological diversity.</p><p> Q: In climate tech, how should impact be measured and tracked; and how do you set investor expectations for the likely outcomes'</p><p> Zhang: We believe there are a few best practices that may help companies and investors navigate the unique challenges of measuring impact in this constantly evolving space. In setting investor expectations, there are four ways to authentically measure the progress companies create: </p><p> Teo: At a baseline level, tracking the financial performance and subjecting the company to the same standard of financial discipline as non-climate-tech companies are important and a key focus at GIC.</p><p> Impact measurement is an evolving space and best practices are still developing. Some possible measures could include activity-based metrics, such as the amount of fossil fuel-powered energy usage the technology replaces (or has the potential to replace), or the amount of clean energy generated. </p><p> We could also look to emissions-based metrics, including avoided emissions, which is something that GIC is evaluating. For solutions such as DAC, the relevant metric could be how much carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. </p><p> Metrics could also be revenue-based, such as measuring the percentage of green revenues generated by the company based on globally accepted taxonomies. </p><p> Forcioli: Investors are looking for a greater level of transparency in portfolio companies and a higher utility level from deployed capital. The measurement and tracking of impact largely depends on the level of disclosure from portfolio companies and the availability of data. In general, impact measurement can be conducted via quantitative assessment and mission-alignment measurement. </p><p> For a quantitative assessment, a manager may employ a proprietary impact assessment tool to identify and assess ESG objectives, which are tracked using indicators such the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals or other climate-related science-based targets. For example, corporates may report active emission-reduction targets by years or Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> Alternatively, an investment manager may select bespoke KPIs for each investment to align mission and measurement. However, this approach may limit the ability to make comparisons across different investments, as the metrics can differ. </p><p> With the rapid development of climate tech, investment managers have also evolved their own measurement methodologies with the help of sustainability consultancies and agencies, but industry standardisation remains a work in progress.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Mathieu Forcioli: As a bank, we have a leading role to play in mobilising the transition to net zero by supporting our customers in their own transition to lower emissions.

Climate change, as described by the United Nations, has become the greatest threat to human security, and has evolved beyond just an environmental problem.

There is a joint understanding among the 27 member states that only if all the member economies pick up more or less at the same time can the single market be strengthened.\"</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;FUNDING THE GREEN TRANSITION&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Of the (EURO)800 billion, some will be spent on accelerating digitalisation, but at least 30 per cent, or around (EURO)250 billion, will be earmarked to support a \"green transition\". Comprising both loans and grants, the funds will be directed to help build the infrastructure, develop technologies and support projects to accelerate decarbonisation throughout the EU. \"The disbursement of funds is conditional on meeting certain milestones and targets,\" Dr Hahn explained. \"We only pay if these are fulfilled - not on the basis of assumptions, but actual deliveries.\"</p><p> There are clear definitions of what investments are \"green\" and sustainable, he said, based on recommendations by the International Capital Markets Association as well as second opinions. The EU has also developed its own reporting guidelines, and information on the projects that are supported is published and has been updated every week since March. By the end of the year, the information will be updated every day. \"So you can see exactly in what areas the investments have taken place,\" said Dr Hahn. \"Market players need to know that what they are investing in is really 'green'.\" Thus, he claims that NGBs are a game changer in that, besides providing the resources for the EU's green transition, they are transparent and credible and set international standards.</p><p> So far, the EU has issued around (EURO)28 billion worth of NGBs, including an issue of (EURO)12 billion in a single day in October, which was oversubscribed, which means that demand exceeded supply. \"Recently, we had an issue that was oversubscribed by 10 times,\" Dr Hahn pointed out. \"So there is huge interest.\" He added that the EU's green bonds also enjoy a premium, which he called a \"greenium\", of around two basis points compared with other green bond issues, which means that they can pay a lower yield.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SINGAPORE AS A REGIONAL HUB&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Many other countries, including Singapore, are also interested in issuing green bonds. The Singapore Government plans to issue $35 billion worth of such bonds by 2030 to finance green infrastructure projects. The fact that Singapore is positioning itself as a regional hub for green bond issuance is \"a very positive development\", said Dr Hahn. \"So we are, in a way, allies, and that is why I have chosen Singapore as my first destination in the region, because I know it's a fertile ground for these ideas.\"</p><p> While in Singapore, Dr Hahn met Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, Monetary Authority of Singapore managing director Ravi Menon, Temasek CEO Dilhan Pillay and GIC CEO Lim Chow Kiat. After Singapore, he travelled to Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Bangkok.</p><p> So far, around half of all green bonds are denominated in euros, \"which shows who is leading the process\", he pointed out. \"But what is positive is that there are more issuances in other currencies as well.\" The total issuance of green bonds worldwide amounts to around (EURO)1 trillion. \"That sounds like a lot, but the issuance in the bond market overall is around (EURO)130 trillion,\" said Dr Hahn. \"So there is still a lot of potential.\"</p><p> However, green bonds are taking off at a time when interest rates are rising, including in the euro zone. Last week, the European Central Bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, by 50 basis points. Rates around the world have also risen and are likely to go up further in the face of inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates depress bond prices, which can discourage issuance.</p><p> \"Whenever you introduce something new, there's always a question mark around whether it's the right time,\" said Dr Hahn. \"We need to be pragmatic and flexible about how fast we go ahead. But about the direction, there can't be any doubt. As (former UN secretary-general) Ban Ki Moon said: 'There is no plan B for this planet, because there is only one planet.'\"</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SHORT-TERM ENERGY CHALLENGES&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;But while green bonds will play a vital role in financing the move to green infrastructure and more sustainable business practices in the medium to long term, the world has to grapple with shortages of mostly fossil-fuel-based energy in the short term. The challenge is especially acute in Europe, where many countries - including its largest economy, Germany - are heavily dependent on natural gas from Russia to meet their energy needs.</p><p> Recently, gas supplies were interrupted for two weeks because of maintenance problems related to the pipeline Nord Stream 1, which is the biggest gas link between Russia and Europe. Although supplies resumed last week, the flows are limited to around 40 per cent of the pipeline's capacity. Many analysts fear that supplies could continue to be interrupted periodically by Russia - especially during winter, when energy demand is high - under the pretext of maintenance problems, as a form of retaliation by Moscow against EU sanctions on Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, this week, Russia's energy giant Gazprom announced a further cut in gas supplies to 20 per cent of Nord Stream 1's capacity, citing technical problems.</p><p> Dr Hahn pointed out that Europe has done a lot to offset the potential loss of energy supplies from Russia. For instance, it has increased its imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by about 75 per cent since the outbreak of the war, including by tripling imports from the United States. It has created energy partnerships with Egypt, Israel, Algeria and Azerbaijan and obtained more oil from Norway. And it is exploring joint procurement of gas to reduce import costs, as well as increasing its storage capacity.</p><p> The EU is also planning to roll out measures to promote energy savings with a view to reducing energy consumption by at least 40 per cent by 2030, relative to 2007 projections. \"For instance, it can make a big difference if you reduce the average temperature for heating by even one degree centigrade in the winter in public buildings and cool less in the summer,\" said Dr Hahn. \"So we have done what a business leader would have to do, which is to diversify risks and increase risk sharing,\" he pointed out.</p><p> He acknowledged that there were challenges. For instance, different EU countries have different needs when it comes to energy infrastructure. Some have LNG terminals, while landlocked countries, like Dr Hahn's native Austria, have to depend more on pipelines. The energy mix also varies from country to country, with some still using coal, some more dependent on gas and oil, and others depending on nuclear energy. \"I am nevertheless confident for this winter,\" he said.</p><p> Dr Hahn expects energy prices to remain elevated. \"They may come down a bit, but they will definitely be higher than before the war.\" The high prices have triggered discussions in some of the EU's member states to put price caps on electricity bills. \"Politicians are challenged to help people in these difficult times because in many countries electricity bills have doubled since last year,\" he pointed out. \"But the most realistic approach is to provide targeted support to those who are in need,\" he said. \"It doesn't make sense to subsidise high-income people. Also, capping prices won't encourage energy savings. This is also linked to our climate goals - looking beyond the current crisis, we need to motivate people to invest in energy savings.\"</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;NO 'SANCTIONS FATIGUE'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Dr Hahn sees little danger of \"sanctions fatigue\" whereby EU citizens, hard-pressed by higher energy prices and inflation, would clamour for the punitive measures against Russia to be relaxed.</p><p> \"Look at the solidarity of people on the issue of Ukraine,\" he pointed out. \"We have received more than seven million refugees, which is far more than during the refugee wave in 2015. The readiness of people to even host refugees in their own homes is really unique and gives support to politicians taking the decisions.</p><p> \"Sanctions have their justification; they're about respecting territorial sovereignty, which is not negotiable,\" he pointed out.</p><p> He believes the sanctions will be effective. \"We know that the Russian people are used to suffering more than Europeans, but over time there will be an impact. Russia is finding it difficult to get spare parts for aeroplanes, has less access to electronic equipment and other technologies, and is excluded from the Swift payments messaging system. All this will have an impact in the medium and long term. Besides, once sanctions are in place, it's done and people accept it, including the business sector. The biggest challenge was to get the sanctions approved.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["He added that the EU's green bonds also enjoy a premium, which he called a \"greenium\", of around two basis points compared with other green bond issues, which means that they can pay a lower yield. &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SINGAPORE AS A REGIONAL HUB&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Many other countries, including Singapore, are also interested in issuing green bonds.

A recent report by Bain and Temasek on South-east Asia's green economy indicates that the demand for green finance in the region is set to reach more than US$3 trillion by 2030.Access to such financing will enable enterprises to capture emerging opportunities in the green economy, such as to conduct research and development activities and eventually commercialise new innovative solutions.Crucially, for businesses seeking to obtain green loans or investments, demonstrating their environmental, social and governance efforts will allow them to raise the chances of unlocking capital from a wider pool of financiers who are aligned with their sustainability goals.The good news is that the banks and investors here are also placing greater emphasis on sustainability projects, integrating sustainability into their loan and investment evaluation frameworks and processes. Financial providers, including commercial banks, multilateral development banks and impact investors, are taking measures to provide clarity on the requirements to qualify for green financing, including relevant green standards or certifications.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also established the Green Finance Industry Taskforce to develop a taxonomy that aims to set out clear definitions and criteria about what activities can be considered green, or in transition towards green. This provides a common language required to provide clarity and confidence to financiers for green projects.Increasing access to green financingVarious government agencies have stepped up efforts to enhance enterprises' access to green financing.For example, the MAS offers grant schemes that defray the incremental costs of corporates taking up green and sustainable bonds and loans.Alongside the ESP, EnterpriseSG launched the Enterprise Financing Scheme - Green (EFS-Green) last October to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to better access green financing and support the development of technologies and solutions to reduce waste, resource use and greenhouse-gas emissions.By providing a 70 per cent risk-share, EFS-Green aims to catalyse lending from our partner financial institutions - DBS, UOB, OCBC, HSBC and CIMB - to SMEs in sectors such as clean energy, circular economy, green infrastructure and clean transportation. This has seen good response since the launch of the scheme. Close to S$100 million in green loans has been catalysed for more than 30 SMEs, spanning areas in solar energy, energy storage, energy efficiency technologies, electric-vehicle technologies, green maritime solutions, green construction technologies, as well as recycling, re-utilisation, remanufacturing and refurbishing of materials and waste.Through a green loan by DBS, solar energy developer Novasix was able to capture new opportunities by developing the SolarNova Phase 6 Project with the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB). It will deploy solar panels across close to 1,200 HDB blocks and 60 government sites. With a solar capacity of 70 megawatt-peak, the project will accelerate the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems in Singapore, contributing to the nation's efforts to develop smart estates by harnessing green energy.Some local enterprises have tapped EFS-Green to scale their innovative green technologies abroad. An example is sustainability artificial-intelligence (AI) company Evercomm Singapore, which designs and provides innovative AI-driven Asset Performance Management solutions. Its Internet-of-Things devices help buildings and infrastructure assets assess and track energy use to improve their energy consumption and operational efficiency. The company received an EFS-Green loan from OCBC, which will enable it to scale up its hardware deployment to capture demand in regional markets such as Malaysia and Thailand.Riding on the growing global demand for green solutions, there is no better time for enterprises to step up and harness green financing to push the boundaries of innovation.This in turn will accelerate the industries' adoption of green solutions and technologies to solve their sustainability challenges and bring us closer towards our climate goals and a low-carbon future.The writer is assistant chief executive officer, Enterprise Singapore.

Good morning, thank you for inviting me. It is my pleasure to join you this morning at the 36th CIO workshop. I am heartened by the organising team's choice to bring together this group to talk about issues of environmental sustainability. And I think the opportunity to discuss the best practices; share ideas of prevailing challenges that we all face, such as how to bring this industry and the environmental sustainability agenda forward, is going to be very useful.</p><p>2. In this room, we recognise the potential for innovative technology solutions to catalyse transformation within our organisations; industries; and business models. That technologically driven transformation allows us to deliver our missions more effectively and productively. However, not all would have developed as deep an understanding of the potential for technology solutions to uplift our organisation's environmental sustainability and resilience.</p><p>3. Today, I will share some thoughts on the opportunities at the convergence of technology and environmental sustainability, and how we can strategically position ourselves to unlock opportunities for our organisations, Singapore, and the world.</p><p>4. Sustainability has always been part of Singapore's DNA, even before the term \"sustainability\" became common. Once, during a certain age, the term \"green\" in Singapore was always preceded by \"clean and\". We were talking about greening our city for a long time. There was this recognition in our society, governance and development. But the idea that \"we are not just small, but also constrained\" - that resource output, carbon output, the factors of production - were always limited for us. This meant that we had to think about \"being green\" before we scientifically understood the environmental cost. We find ourselves now in transition, where much of the world has understood the same challenges.</p><p>5. In 2022, we renewed this commitment through our Green Plan to achieve net zero by 2050. The public sector is committed to lead this via our GreenGov.sg initiative. To achieve this, we will continue to develop innovative solutions and changes in how we operate.</p><p>6. We have made progress in sustainability of the built environment through infrastructure improvements which promote walking, cycling and public transport, enhancing energy efficiency such as through the use of LED and energy saving devices, and cultivating communities to care for the environment.</p><p>7. As an ICT community, we are powering the digitalisation and transformation across sectors. Therefore, if we take active steps across our value chain to enable this increasingly Green ICT and unlock ICT for Green, we can bring very significant benefits to all. While this is a nascent space, it is timely to think about what our approach might be and what we should put effort and priority on.</p><p>8. Green ICT could take many forms such as:</p><p>i. adapting data centres to be more energy efficient,</p><p>ii. adopting green software and software development practices that minimise energy consumption and</p><p>iii. exploring green ICT products and services with lower emissions profile.</p><p>9. To catalyse these efforts, we have prioritised sustainability as a key theme in our Next Bound of Digital Government. We have recently launched our Digital Connectivity Blueprint (DCB) detailing some of the things we will need to do in the next 5 to 10 years to make sure of infrastructure that supports our technology and ICT transformation here in Singapore is - robust, resilient, fit for purpose - and you will find throughout that document, repeated commitments to an increasingly green infrastructure standard. Green ICT will also be a consideration in our procurement practices. We cannot do it on our own and need industry to widen the range of cost-effective sustainable products and services.</p><p>10. Green ICT has to be harnessed as a means of pursuing sustainability. This includes:</p><p>i. using modelling and simulation tools to optimise planning and design options which leads to reduced emission pressures - such as building configurations that optimise environment factors requiring less energy for cooling and locating EV chargers to promote adoption of EVs,</p><p>ii. implementing smart systems in buildings, such as smart lifts which are both energy efficient and reliable and</p><p>iii. employing sustainability monitoring and reporting tools to help households reduce energy consumption and businesses to access green financing.</p><p>11. We see these starting to manifest in our new towns, such as Punggol, which is greener. We have the Punggol Digital District, developing jobs in this ecosystem and industry. Punggol as a town is also greener. We have made a deliberate effort to make sure the environment has that ecological footprint. We have used micro-climatic simulation which informed the town layout during the planning stage improving wind flow; and smart lifts, utility meters, lighting, pumps, irrigation are deployed within the estate today. These technologies have improved over the last few decades and HDB has done this over 20 - 25 years and you can see different stages of these implementations, informing us how we might take these technologies and implement around field sites across Singapore. These solutions, together with changes in business models have the potential to scale across both brownfield and greenfield sites, and potentially offer good returns on investment.</p><p>12. In this space, we can't get things done without data. We need fit-for-purpose data to drive the above innovations; the tools alone will not deliver the desired outcomes. Simulations rely on representative data as inputs to the studies; smart systems will depend on timely and accurate data to inform decisions, and reporting standards requires reliable and efficient data sources if the reporting standards were to play their part as adequate safeguards.</p><p>13. These are unfortunately not easy to address, as data may at times be costly to collect and manage; there may also be different interests between the data owners and data consumers. Having robust governance mechanisms to facilitate data sharing among public and private stakeholders, is one of the means that we believe can help overcome the challenges.</p><p>14. For example, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the National Research Foundation (NRF) have set up the Super Low Energy Building (SLEB) Smart Hub to aid building owners and developers to assess the cost-benefit of solutions. This centralised resource is a one-stop platform to access information on green building technologies and performance data. It is also equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, to provide personalised recommendations tailored to the specific needs of building owners.</p><p>15. As part of our national Research and Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) efforts, we are building a new platform to facilitate the safe sharing of government data in the Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS) domain. This will streamline the search and access of data needed for USS research and enable more insights and innovation to be unlocked.</p><p>16. To foster Green Financing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been driving Project Greenprint to facilitate flow of consistent and reliable ESG data among financial institutions, investors, and green technology solution providers. This collaborative framework focuses on putting verifiable data in the hands of financiers, to allow investments and loans to flow towards firms that are keen to leverage technology in their sustainability journeys. This also supports financial institutions' own efforts to decarbonise their portfolios, creating a win-win situation for all involved.</p><p>17. For the above to happen, partnerships are key, and are essential in our way forward. We need to pool together our collective wisdom and efforts of the public sector, industry, institutes of higher learning (IHLs), professional bodies and our communities.</p><p>18. In places like Punggol Digital District and Jurong Lake District, we are experimenting not only with new smart and green technologies, but also new models of partnerships. In PDD, JTC and SIT formed a Living Lab to enable like-minded partners to jointly build a talent pipeline, co-innovate and do test-bedding, and drive entrepreneurship to scale these models. In Jurong Lake District, IMDA, SNDGO and URA launched an Innovation challenge to invite solutions from industry and researchers to address challenges in waste and water management, promote a car-lite lifestyle, and enable low-carbon solutions.</p><p>19. Other than these industry partnerships, community driven initiatives also have a role in engineering sustainability and community spirit. Efforts by Engineering Good has ensured that vulnerable communities such as those who are low-income or have disabilities also have access to these empowering technologies. They do this by salvaging and upcycling laptops to provide devices to those in need, thus making sure that no one gets left behind in this digital age while also tackling the issue of e-waste.</p><p>20. There are many things to be done in this space. Things for Government, things for the private sector and things for the community. Many challenges and tasks to be addressed - how do we green our infrastructure, data and governance, development processes, how we bring together new models and how do we bring together tools to govern all of this. This means that there are plenty for us to do and hopefully this means there is lots of opportunity in this space.</p><p>21. I urge all of us in the ICT professional community to bring together our expertise and experience to chart the future approach of Green ICT and ICT for Green together. This will serve our generation and future generations well, as we continue to harness the growing capabilities of ICT, developments from AI and autonomous systems, and our ambitions in smart cities and smart urban solutions.</p><p>22. I wish all of you a fruitful time in the workshop.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Communications and Information, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Energy, Events, ESG]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["9.

Good morning. I am very happy to join you for this year's Global Insurance Forum - finally, back in Singapore, in-person, after three years in a virtual format. It's good that we have the chance to meet face-to-face. Let me also extend a very warm welcome to all our overseas guests.</p><p>2. Since we last gathered in Singapore, the global economy and risk landscape has seen some pronounced shifts.</p><p>a. We are moving from a period of benign globalisation to a new era of great power competition.</p><p>b. We can see this around us - in Europe, an ongoing war in Ukraine; in the Middle East, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which threatens to widen into a regional conflict, which will have risks to food and oil supply. In Asia, fortunately, we still have peace and stability. But as we all know, there are flash points in the South China Sea, where accidents and miscalculations can easily happen.</p><p>c. In this new era, the global consensus around free trade, unfortunately, has been fraying. Countries are prioritising geopolitical risks and national security above free trade.</p><p>d. That's why global supply chains are being reconfigured along geopolitical lines rather than economic logic.</p><p>e. On the macroeconomic front, governments and companies are also adapting to higher interest rates, which we expect to be higher for longer. Higher interest rates will in some ways reduce market distortions after going through more than a decade of easy money. It will also reduce the misallocation of capital that we had seen during that time. But there will certainly be painful adjustments in the path towards the new normal. Governments that have been used to deficit financing with large deficits and high levels of debt must find it very hard to sustain that with interest rates at new highs.</p><p>3. Amidst this more challenging backdrop, we also have to consider other major trends. There are two which l will highlight:</p><p>a. Climate change and the transition to net-zero, and</p><p>b. The adoption and evolution of game-changing technologies like artificial intelligence.</p><p>4. As we grapple with all of these changes around us, the insurance industry will play a key role, because you are experts in understanding, mitigating and financing risks. All of you in the insurance industry are important partners for businesses and policymakers. Together, we will have to navigate the risks in this new world, tackle the challenges and also seize new opportunities that will arise from these developments.</p><p>5. Today, I will touch on three themes to unlock and accelerate the value of insurance. These are the three \"Ts\" of Transition, Technology and Talent. Let me take them in turn.</p><p>Transition to Net-Zero</p><p>6. First, on the transition to net-zero. The climate crisis is worsening and requires collective and urgent action. Global temperatures are rising, and this has already impacted food and water security in many parts of the globe. We are experiencing more frequent weather changes, and more fatal extreme heat events. We are in a race to reach net-zero by 2050, to avoid irreversible global climate damage. Year-by-year, when we look at the events around us, we worry that we are lagging behind in achieving this target.</p><p>7. Asia will be the key battleground in this race to net-zero. Asia accounts for half of global greenhouse gas emissions, as most of its energy needs today are being met through fossil fuels, including coal. Moreover, much of Asia is developing, and its energy needs are rising. There are still millions of people in Asia without basic access to electricity and water.</p><p>8. But it is going to be very expensive for Asia to decarbonise. For instance, carbon-intensive infrastructure needs to be upgraded or replaced, and new low-carbon energy infrastructure needs to be put in place. The insurance industry can be a powerful enabler for such transition finance.</p><p>9. As underwriters, the industry can develop insurance solutions for renewable energy infrastructure and emerging technologies with promising decarbonisation potential.</p><p>a. These solutions can help mitigate risk and help crowd in much-needed private capital.</p><p>b. For instance, renewable energy infrastructure like solar and wind plants can have variable returns due to weather-dependent energy output. To mitigate the variability of returns, some renewable plants can benefit from parametric insurance covers, which pay out when energy output falls below pre-agreed thresholds.</p><p>c. Future fuels like green hydrogen hold huge promise for decarbonisation. Innovative risk management and insurance solutions can help to mitigate the risks involved in the storage and transportation of hydrogen, enabling larger scale production on a commercial scale, and attracting private capital into this new area of energy infrastructure.</p><p>10. As investors, insurers can allocate more capital to address the infrastructure needs of emerging Asia, particularly green infrastructure.</p><p>11. The scale and investment characteristics of infrastructure line up well for insurers' investment needs.</p><p>a. Insurers hold significant investment capacity relative to the infrastructure investment need. According to the World Bank, a 5% allocation of insurers' gross written premiums into infrastructure investments could close half of the world's annual infrastructure investment gap [1]</p><p>b. Infrastructure assets have long duration and can potentially match well with the long-term liabilities of life insurers.</p><p>c. Infrastructure finance is typically structured to keep pace with inflation, which can provide risk diversification and serve as an alternative asset for insurers' investment portfolios.</p><p>d. To support insurers' investments into infrastructure assets, MAS has been closely monitoring international standards in the insurance industry and studying available data relating to infrastructure assets. We will soon issue a public consultation on the proposed capital treatment for insurers' investments in infrastructure assets.</p><p>12. Given the natural fit between insurers' investment needs and infrastructure assets, why don't we see larger allocations by insurers?</p><p>13. The simple answer is the bankability of projects - only 10% of projects in Asia's emerging economies are bankable [2] . This clearly constrains the available pipeline of investible opportunities for insurers.</p><p>a. In this regard, blended finance can be the solution to bring marginally bankable infrastructure projects within the investment risk appetite of insurers and other private investors.</p><p>b. Through blended finance, we use a limited pool of concessional capital from public or philanthropic sources, to crowd in multiples of private capital.</p><p>14. That's why Singapore has been actively supporting and promoting this space.</p><p>a. We have platforms that aim to scale infrastructure investments and blended finance. One example is Bayfront Infrastructure Management, which acquires infrastructure debt from banks and repackages them as Infrastructure Asset-Backed Securities (IABS), providing institutional investors including insurers, access to a diversified portfolio of infrastructure exposures.</p><p>b. In addition, Singapore is working closely with key partners to develop a blended finance platform that will invest in green and transition energy infrastructure in the region. The platform will allow commercial participation alongside concessional and catalytic capital, to channel financing to projects that would otherwise be only marginally bankable.</p><p>c. The insurance industry can invest in the commercial tranches, and also provide risk mitigation solutions to bring more energy infrastructure projects to market.</p><p>15. This morning, I am also pleased to share that MAS is working on a pilot with the industry to support the flow of life insurer investments into sustainability-related infrastructure projects in Asia. This pilot will testbed a customised package of risk guardrails, risk-appropriate regulatory treatment and capability building facilities to enhance insurers' familiarity and comfort with infrastructure investments, while putting in place suitable investment caps. We hope this initiative can provide an impetus for insurers to allocate some of their investment portfolio to infrastructure projects with promising decarbonisation potential, and play a role in our region's net-zero transition.</p><p>16. Besides your role as underwriters and as investors, insurers have close relationships with your underwriting clients and investee companies. By integrating physical and transition risks as part of the underwriting process and sharing their insights on material areas of risk exposure and resulting economic impact, insurers can nudge their clients to transition to a lower carbon footprint.</p><p>a. To facilitate this process, MAS recently proposed guidelines on transition planning for banks, insurers and asset managers in Singapore. Part of an insurer's transition plan will involve stewarding their clients and investee companies to transition in an orderly manner, through engagement and facilitating transition activities, rather than indiscriminately cutting ties with clients or investee companies deemed to be of higher climate risks. A structured process, active engagement, and a risk-proportionate approach taking into account sectoral as well as firm-specific factors will be important aspects of transition planning.</p><p>b. To do this well, insurers and brokers need to develop the right capabilities and solutions. On this note, I welcome the launch of the WTW Asia-Pacific Climate Risk Centre in Singapore. The centre will develop risk advisory, analytics and risk financing solutions to support transition efforts of firms in hard-to-abate industrial sectors key for Asia's growth. The WTW centre adds to the growing community of Asia-focused climate financing capabilities across the financial sector, academia and professional services based in Singapore. I encourage strong collaboration between these teams, so that we can all accelerate the green transition in Asia.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence</p><p>17. The second \"T\" is technology. There are many areas of technology, but I will focus on artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular what everyone is excited about: Generative AI (Gen AI).</p><p>a. Several insurance players have begun experimenting with how Gen AI can transform their business functions.</p><p>b. For now, there are limited use cases of strong impact. But as with all technology waves, we tend to overestimate the potential in the short-term, and underestimate the potential in the longer-term. There is usually a lot of hype going into a new technology, and a lot of disappointment after the hype. Later on, as the technology matures and with greater adoption, we should see more promising use cases.</p><p>c. In time to come, I have no doubt that the models will get better, and will be applied across a wider range of applications and functions, and will bring about the transformation in finance and insurance. At the same time, we will have to grapple with deep ethical issues, and consider how AI systems can be imbued with human context and human values.</p><p>18. MAS is supporting the use of Gen AI in the industry in two ways. First, in facilitating the development of a governance framework for responsible AI, to harness its benefits while mitigating the downside risks.</p><p>a. A Gen AI model failure, while may be rare, could result in widespread damage if the model is fully trusted in the wrong scenario. One may say that the chance of a model failure is only 1%, but that 1% failure can have widespread implications if it is applied wrongly. Guardrails are necessary so that financial institutions can adopt Gen AI in a responsible manner that keeps consumers, businesses and the broader economy safe.</p><p>b. MAS has also launched Project MindForge to promote the responsible use of Gen AI. MindForge provides a platform that pools data resources from the financial industry with Gen AI technologies to test use cases, like managing complex compliance tasks, against comprehensive risk frameworks. This iterative process will generate learnings to improve the industry's overall resilience, and provide a controlled approach towards the safe adoption of Gen AI. We hope to onboard insurers as we develop MindForge further.</p><p>19. Second, MAS is supporting efforts to build an adequate base of tech and AI talent for the financial services sector, including for insurance.</p><p>a. MAS has launched several programmes in this area. The Financial Sector Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Talent Development Programme involves the industry working with training providers and institutes of higher learning in Singapore to curate programmes that meet the needs of the financial sector and the insurance industry.</p><p>b. Insurers have also tapped on MAS' grant support to develop use cases focussed on improving customers' claim journey, detecting fraud in claim submissions, and improving customer experience. All of which demonstrate the concrete value that AI can bring to the insurance value chain.</p><p>Talent Development</p><p>20. This brings me to my third \"T\" on talent. Beyond the specific talent development programme for AI, addressing Asia's growing insurance needs will require a strong base of Asia-savvy talent, with the required linguistic skills, recognising the diversity of Asia, in-market experience, networks, and insurance aptitude. This remains a gap in the market.</p><p>21. The industry needs to have a well-thought-out strategy, and come together in a more systematic manner to attract and cultivate such talent. Key to this will be efforts to attract younger people, including from our polytechnics and universities.</p><p>a. There is stiff competition for talent everywhere, in all sectors of the economy, and especially in finance. So the insurance industry will need to redouble efforts to attract its share of talent.</p><p>b. Today, if you do a survey of young people thinking of career choices in finance, most of them, top-of-mind, will think about jobs in a bank, an asset management firm or a family office.</p><p>c. We want them to also think about the wide range of attractive and exciting career prospects and pathways in insurance, as all of you can attest to.</p><p>22. There have been promising results when industry comes together to generate interest among young people.</p><p>a. The Global-Asia Insurance Partnership (GAIP), for example, organises an annual case study challenge which has drawn more than 570 tertiary students across disciplines to develop innovative solutions to address real-world problems faced by the insurance industry.</p><p>b. Students not only get a chance to apply their resourcefulness and pitch their solutions to industry veterans, they also stand a chance to secure internship opportunities from leading insurance firms. There needs to be more of such collaborative efforts between industry, students, universities to develop the future leaders of the insurance industry.</p><p>c. Singapore is committed to supporting the talent needs of our insurance industry. We have developed a range of programmes including internships and apprenticeships with polytechnics and universities, work-study programmes, leadership development programmes, as well as postings to the region. We are prepared to do more and are prepared to work with the industry to build up capabilities and talent for insurance. I encourage all the key companies in the insurance industry to actively take up these programmes, work closely with MAS in this area, and let us all come up with new ways to strengthen the talent pipeline for the insurance industry, not just for Singapore, but for the region and the world.</p><p>23. Talent development and innovation will continue to be key drivers of value and it is apt that GIF is focusing on these areas through its \"Leaders of Tomorrow\" and \"Global Innovation Awards\". I encourage you to advance this good work, so that we together we can nurture more talents for the insurance industry.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>24. I spoke about three \"Ts\": transition, technology and talent. But I should also end with the final \"T\", that is trust. Without trust, everything is a challenge. When there is trust, we can achieve many things together. For Singapore, trust is our most precious asset. Trust, we believe, is built by drops, but lost in buckets. We take trust very seriously. We uphold trust within our country, working very closely with partners like all of you in the industry. Together, we hope that we can continue to develop Singapore as a reliable and trusted hub for finance and for insurance, in the region and in the world.</p><p>25. To conclude, the insurance industry's ability to manage large, complex and evolving risks will enable the global economy to flourish, despite the many new risks we face. I am confident that the insurance industry will further deepen its value to society in supporting the climate transition, in harnessing the use of technology, and developing the talent needed to make these possible.</p><p>26. I wish all of you a very fruitful and productive forum, and a good time here in Singapore.

This is because such skills are not only in demand, but have also been found to be highly transferable across different jobs and industries, a report published on Tuesday (Nov 22) by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) has shown. The government agency that is driving the national movement to promote a culture of lifelong learning is refreshing its course offerings from next year. The second edition of the Skills Demand for the Future Economy Report aims to give insights on the jobs and skills that workers need to stay competitive, based on the roles that are likely to be in demand. The report's findings are based on SSG's database of job types and listings, business, labour and market intelligence, as well as contributions from experts. Similar to the inaugural report last year, the report continues to spotlight three growth areas - digital economy, green economy and care economy - that are in tandem with Singapore's economic priorities in the coming years. </p><p>\"These growth areas remain important as they heavily influence the emergence of new skills demand across many different industry sectors,\" the agency said. The latest report includes an analysis of skills associated with the increasing adoption of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies, which integrate automation and data exchange in sectors such as manufacturing. SSG said that it has mapped out 60 \"priority skills\" associated with these technologies. \"There is a fair degree of overlap with priority skills associated with digital and green economies, as digitalisation and sustainability are key themes for I4.0,\" it added. \"Companies looking to implement I4.0 will need to upskill or reskill their workforce, as manufacturing processes become more digitalised, connected and sustainable.\" GREEN ECONOMY The report found that many existing jobs will require green skills as companies across sectors adopt more environmentally sustainable practices and set sustainability targets for compliance and reporting, in tandem with nationwide efforts. Environmental, sustainability and compliance-related skills are the most transferable across sectors and job roles. Among the emerging domains with high demand growth are: Green infrastructure and mobility (demand growth of 194 per cent from 2018 to 2021) Energy, resource circularity and decarbonisation (129 per cent) Sustainable finance (1,550 per cent) The report highlighted the emerging area of sustainable finance, as the financial services sector is beginning to introduce green investments, loans and financial instruments to support companies tapping green economy opportunities. Skills in urban farming, food technologies and novel food development are also a nascent trend, the report read. This is in line with Singapore's aim to safeguard food security by producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. DIGITAL ECONOMY Riding on the post-Covid-19 wave, digital economy jobs and skills continue to see high demand. In particular, software development skills see the highest demand growth and high transferability. Other skills with high demand growth are: Solution architecture (108 per cent) Radio frequency engineering (166 per cent) Software testing (100 per cent) More job roles will require skills in e-commerce and digital marketing as well as artificial intelligence, data and analytics, the report found. This is because Singapore's growth in e-commerce sales is expected to reach S$19.6 billion by 2027, it noted. CARE ECONOMY To cater to the needs of an ageing population and workforce, there is an increasing need for preventive and community care, adult education, and workplace learning and development. Skills in collaborating with stakeholders are among the fastest growing, while those in person-centred care, and teaching and learning domains have the highest transferability. Other skills with high demand growth are: Community partnership (200 per cent) Professional consultation (105 per cent) Family and caregiver engagement (100 per cent) Demand for skills in the health and wellness domain has also risen significantly since 2019, the report found. Skills related to health, hygiene and nutrition for children, which are needed in job roles such as enrolled nurses and early intervention educator, have seen demand growth of 159 per cent. NEED TO OFFER SUITABLE COURSES Business management and human resource experts who spoke to TODAY said that more can be done to improve the availability of suitable programmes needed for people interested to make the switch, particularly for roles in the green economy. Professor Boh Wai Fong, deputy dean of Nanyang Business School at Nanyang Technological University, said that there are some course offerings in this sector, but \"we are not there yet in terms of adequate supply\". She added that these roles involve skill sets that are not widely known and that not many institutions here can provide the requisite training. Ms Carmen Wee, chief executive officer of human resource advisory services firm Carmen Wee and Associates, said that the pace of developing and curating the courses would need to match the growth rate of the green economy sector, adding that the industry here has only a \"few hundred\" individuals in corporate roles. Turning to courses in the IT sector, experts said that some of these courses may not be suited for those without any background knowledge, unless they have existing skills or competencies that can help them tackle new IT knowledge. Associate Professor Guan Chong, deputy director from the Centre for Continuing and Professional Education at Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that bite-sized, just-in-time training coupled with workplace learning would work well for talents with highly \"adjacent skills\". \"For instance, if an employer can't find someone who knows natural language processing (a machine learning technique), he or she should consider hiring someone who knows Python (a popular programming language). Such a person is more likely to learn natural language processing faster than someone who doesn't,\" he added. Agreeing, Associate Professor Song Zhaoli from the department of management and organisation in the National University of Singapore Business School said that several of these professional jobs require a longer period of acquiring special knowledge and skill. It would be unrealistic for instance, to expect that someone with zero background to complete a crash course on Python with SkillsFuture and perform the role of a data analyst. \"Such a role most likely requires at least a bachelor's degree and preferably a post-graduate degree in relevant fields,\" he said. Yet, for other roles within the IT sector such as a talent analyst, Assoc Prof Song said that it is possible for someone such as an experienced human resource professional with no IT background to take a Python crash course and become work-ready. \"For senior jobseekers, it is important to leverage their own past work experience and then a relatively short SkillsFuture course can provide them with new job perspectives,\" he added.</p>", "publisher": "Today (Singapore) - Online", "instances": ["GREEN ECONOMY The report found that many existing jobs will require green skills as companies across sectors adopt more environmentally sustainable practices and set sustainability targets for compliance and reporting, in tandem with nationwide efforts.

So it's very important that we make sure that the financial system is able to take any potential shocks,\" she said.</p><p> Dr McBain also said that there has been a huge global increase in sustainable financing on a fast trajectory.</p><p> Within the region, China leads with the most sustainability bond issuances.

We are talking about a term of over 20 years or even longer than that, depending on the type of product.</p><p> \"The fact that there is a long-term liability means the impact of climate change becomes quite critical.\"</p><p> He said that the insurance industry can also invest in more diverse investment portfolios that include sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations.</p><p> Mr Ronak Shah, president of the General Insurance Association of Singapore, said that general insurance companies also take guidance from what happens elsewhere in the world, as they promote sustainability and also contribute to the movement by going green in their internal functions.</p><p> Some insurers also set an example by reinvesting some of their premiums into sustainable investments.</p><p> \"So what we see going forward is insurance contributing to that entire ecosystem of sustainability,\" Mr Shah said.</p><p> Ms Karine Kam, Singapore College of Insurance chief executive, said: \"We need to move from just embedding sustainability within the insurance value chain, including lending and investment decisions, to a point where this becomes the standard practice across insurers.\"</p><p> In February, the MAS and The Institute of Banking and Finance laid out 12 skills needed in sustainable finance to guide professionals in being ready for the green future.</p><p> Prudential Singapore also said it would roll out organisation-wide ESG training for employees and financial consultants from this month to ensure everyone knows how they can incorporate ESG principles in their roles.</p><p> And at the end of the day, consumers themselves will be the ones pushing insurers to be more green and accountable, Ms Kam said.</p><p> \"There will be a growing awareness of sustainability among our insurance consumers.

The push towards this goal and the transition present a challenge that has many implications for Singapore, given that GVC activities and trade have been our economic lifeline. With trade that is more than three times our GDP, many of our companies - together with multinationals - are all engaged in value chain activities of some kind.</p><p> The role and evolution of GVCs, together with challenges and implications regarding carbon emissions, are spelt out in the latest publication by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Sustaining Global Value Chains, to be released at its annual meeting next week.</p><p> We estimate that more than 70 per cent of Singapore's exports are GVC-related. As companies come under increasing pressure from governments and consumers to decarbonise, it stands to reason that Singapore will need to act quickly.</p><p> The pressure is on as GVC products and activities embed a significant amount of carbon emissions, which are then traded across borders.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;HOW OUR EXPORTS WILL BE AFFECTED&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; True, by gross emissions embedded in trade, Singapore is not significant because of the relatively small size of our economy.</p><p> But when emissions are priced at a conservative US$40 (S$54) per tonne (the lower level recommended by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices) and expressed as a percentage of Singapore's GDP, net emissions exported are around 0.7 per cent of GDP annually.</p><p> This is not Singapore's emissions alone, but the net emission exported through trade. Furthermore, carbon prices are expected to go up to US$50-US$100 per tonne by 2030, as recommended by the commission.</p><p> If emissions are not controlled, border tax adjustments by other countries might follow, and Singapore's exports will be affected.</p><p> The European Union, for example, is already planning such border taxes on carbon-intensive imports.</p><p> As well, GVC activities are transport-intensive. Intermediate goods have to flow from multiple locations, often crossing borders several times in different stages of production, before reaching final destinations.</p><p> Looking at our wholesale trade and transport sectors, Singapore not only benefits from its own GVC exports but also from trade activities passing through its airport and ports. Transport related to international trade now accounts for more than two billion tonnes of emissions a year and is expected to rise quickly. Emissions will be even higher if local freighting is included. This, too, will not be sustainable without emission controls.</p><p> In short, the transition towards net zero emissions will present disruptions for Singapore, both from our position as a hub for companies and as a hub for transport. Singapore needs to urgently prepare for this.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SO HOW TO PREPARE'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; For renewable energy generation, Singapore naturally begins with a disadvantage, given its small size and lack of renewable energy endowments.</p><p> Our recent investments into utility-size floating solar farms are necessary and encouraging, but will be far from sufficient to meet the needs of GVC activities.</p><p> Yet Singapore sits in a region that is relatively well endowed with renewable energy potential, and electricity generated by renewable sources can be imported when transmission lines and grids are connected.</p><p> Such import of electricity naturally raises some concerns over energy security.</p><p> In principle, imported electricity does not give rise to any more long-term security risks than imported fossil fuel - both depend on international cooperation that underpins well-functioning energy markets.</p><p> The additional risks for imported renewable electricity are its intermittency and zero time lag in the event of operational disruptions.</p><p> Furthermore, disruptions may occur in other jurisdictions, making remedy more challenging.</p><p> There are no easy solutions to energy security, but this can be mitigated through a mix of various present and likely future technologies - standby power generation capacity, battery storage, and transitioning to clean hydrogen or biofuels which can be stored.</p><p> Realistically, Singapore will also have to accept that some energy intensive industries will have to be relocated closer to renewable energy sources in the longer run.</p><p> Away from production of energy intensive goods, Singapore has a better set of circumstances. There is a certain clustering benefit and \"stickiness\" to GVC activities. With a strong history of hosting international companies, it is well positioned to work with companies to organise these value chains for greener production, to provide greater data transparency, and to offset GVC emissions.</p><p> As a financial centre, it is also well-positioned to be a centre of green finance and ensuring high financing standards.</p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore has rightly been an early advocate on this. Infrastructure Asia's efforts to catalyse sustainable infrastructure in the region will also indirectly help Singapore.</p><p> On aviation and sea transport, two growing but hard to abate sectors, it should be noted that Singapore does not face any particular disadvantage compared with other hubs as far as green fuels are concerned. The key is to implement fast when the technology and economics allow.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;PLANNING FOR HIGHER PRICES&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; While the carbon tax in Singapore is still low in the interim, Government and companies will have to plan as if a very high carbon price is already upon us, with a tight constraint already in place.</p><p> This realisation and mindset must be the first step in our net zero transition. Large companies, with their sizeable GVC operations, have a particular responsibility on this, given their emissions and their ability to influence the rest of the supply chains, often across multiple jurisdictions.</p><p> Infrastructure plans for various scenarios will also have to be made ready, to allow companies and sectors to transit to different fuel sources once the economics for hydrogen and biofuels make these commercially feasible.</p><p> The ingenuity of GVCs is to allow each production step to be shored to a location with the greatest relative advantage, before coming together for the final product.</p><p> This is the source of its tremendous economic efficiency. But less recognised is the fact that fossil fuel, given its storability and transportability, has been the secret \"dirty\" ingredient that allows humanity to decouple production from where the fuel is found.</p><p> Because of fossil fuels, economic geography has not been tied to energy geography. Singapore's small size and lack of energy resources have not constrained its prosperity.</p><p> The phasing out of fossil fuels thus poses a severe challenge to GVCs and their model of distributed production.</p><p> Falling transport costs, which have facilitated the dramatic rise in international trade that benefits open economies like Singapore, will have to rise. Singapore will be deeply affected.</p><p> Our energy mix, industrial production, transport, and infrastructure will need to change significantly over the next three decades.</p><p> While technology around renewable energy production, storage and transport holds much promise, the transition towards net zero promises to be difficult, as seen in recent disruptions in energy markets.</p><p> Economies that provide green production opportunities will gain an advantage and become attractive hosts to GVC activities. The race for sustainable GVCs and future prosperity has already begun.</p><p>\u00b7Dr Thia Jang Ping is lead economist and manager of the economics department at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 99, "title": "Welcome Address by Senior Minister of State For Finance and Transport, Mr Chee Hong Tat, at the Singapore @ Nor-Shipping Seminar", "published": "2023-06-08", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome Address by Senior Minister of State For Finance and Transport, Mr Chee Hong Tat, at the Singapore @ Nor-Shipping Seminar: \"It is fitting that this year's theme focuses on #PartnerShip.

Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you today at the Singapore @ Nor-Shipping Seminar.</p><p>2. This marks the tenth time that Singapore is participating in Nor-Shipping. I was glad to see Singapore companies showcasing their innovative products, solutions and capabilities at the Singapore Pavilion, which we launched yesterday. We are deeply honoured that His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Norway had paid the Singapore Pavilion a visit yesterday.</p><p>3. It is fitting that this year's theme focuses on #PartnerShip. Amidst the changing landscape of the maritime industry, strong partnerships across nations, organisations, companies and individuals are more important than ever. We need to collectively address the challenges faced by the industry, and see how we can make the best use of our resources and tap on new opportunities.</p><p>4. I am glad that Singapore and Norway have a strong and longstanding relationship, especially in the maritime domain. This partnership has enabled our countries to jointly innovate and explore opportunities to transform the maritime sector.</p><p>5. Today's seminar by the Singapore Norway Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Singapore Maritime Foundation, Nor-Shipping 2023, Norwegian Business Association Singapore and Innovation Norway is testament to the close collaboration between both countries.</p><p>Partnering in Decarbonisation</p><p>6. Decarbonisation is a key focus for many countries, including Singapore and Norway. Maritime Singapore has been actively working with different partners on initiatives to decarbonise the maritime industry. By this, I mean both in port operations and also in shipping - which includes both domestic harbourcraft and international ships.</p><p>7. MPA is working with industry partners, institutes of higher learning and organisations like the Maritime Energy and Sustainable Development Centre of Excellence, and the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation on efforts to develop, trial and deploy maritime decarbonisation solutions in Singapore.</p><p>8. Norway has been a key partner in our decarbonisation efforts. At the port level, MPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Port of Rotterdam in August last year to establish a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor. The corridor will pilot the deployment of digital solutions, support investment in green infrastructure, and develop enablers to accelerate low and zero carbon shipping.</p><p>9. We are exploring similar collaborations with other ports around the world. MPA had also signed an agreement with the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach in the USA, to establish a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor. During the Singapore Maritime Week in April this year, we had also shared some of these updates.</p><p>10. At the country level, we are working closely with like-minded partners to accelerate the deployment of solutions to reduce carbon emissions. In March this year, the International Maritime Organization, the Ministry of Climate and Environment of Norway and MPA signed a MOU to bring together Norway's GreenVoyage 2050 project and Singapore's NextGen Connect Initiative. This collaboration will allow us to better support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions from ships and in ports.</p><p>11. Just a few weeks ago, MPA worked with the Embassy of France in Singapore and Innovation Norway to convene a scenario-based workshop on ammonia bunkering safety. Over 70 participants from 12 countries, including port authorities, emergency response agencies, maritime classification societies, research institutes and knowledge partners, fuel suppliers, shipping lines and charters, attended this fruitful session.</p><p>12. Today, I am happy to announce that Norway and Singapore will be taking a further step to strengthen our longstanding maritime partnership. I look forward to signing the Maritime Transport MOU with Minister Bjrnar Skjran.</p><p>13. The MOU affirms the close partnership between Singapore and Norway, and I believe this will further enhance our cooperation and knowledge exchange in areas such as maritime decarbonisation, digitalisation and innovation. This MOU goes beyond decarbonisation, because it also allows us to work together on other important areas like digitalisation and innovation, and these areas are all interconnected.</p><p>Collaborating in Digital and Technology Innovation</p><p>14. We want to, for example, through digitalisation and innovation efforts, to improve the efficiency of ship operations. When we visited DNV yesterday, they made a point that often the first step to helping shipowners reduce their carbon emissions is just to make ship operations more efficient. This is something that all of us can do, but we need to work together to find solutions.</p><p>15. In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore trialed the Maritime Drone Estate, an initiative by MPA. This was partly driven by obstacles faced in that period such as limitations on people going on board ships. We tried to think of a different way of solving the problem rather than doing nothing - so we used drones to deliver supplies and send 3D-printed spare parts to the ships in our anchorages. It turned out to be quicker, better, faster, and also cheaper.</p><p>16. This is something that I hope we can do in order to innovate together, using digital solutions and technologies, and also to review our rules and regulations, to allow the implementation of new solutions. Safety is paramount, we do keep that in consideration, but we are also finding new breakthroughs that will allow us to push the boundaries.This would not be possible if Governments and industries do not work together. In order to support innovation, Governments need to be aware of the technologies that industry partners are interested in deploying, and industry partners would not be able to implement their solutions without adapting to existing rules and regulations, overseen by Governments.</p><p>17. This partnership between Governments and industries is crucial, and this is something that I hope we can do together with our friends from Norway, and industry partners from both countries.</p><p>18. We will also continue to develop a vibrant ecosystem to support innovation and partnerships that benefit the maritime industry. MPA and the Research Council of Norway (RCN) first signed a MOU in 2000 to collaborate on Research and Development, Education and Training in areas such as maritime environment, sustainable energy technology, offshore and marine engineering.</p><p>19. The MOU was renewed for the eighth time in April 2021 and was expanded to include more areas of collaboration such as information communications technology. MPA also launched the Maritime Innovation and Technology Fund (the MINT Fund) in 2003 and the PIER71TM Smart Port Challenge in 2017 to encourage and support the development of innovative solutions for the industry. I know many of the Norwegian companies have participated in some of these efforts, and have benefitted from the funding as well.</p><p>20. Since then, MPA has committed S$325 million under the MINT Fund, supported over 100 Marinetech start-ups, attracted over S$50 million investments and forged collaborations with over 50 maritime corporate partners under PIER71TM.</p><p>Talent is Key</p><p>21. Underpinning our efforts to decarbonise and innovate, is talent. And talent includes both men and women. We want to make sure that the maritime sector remains inclusive, and we want to attract talented individuals to join the maritime industry, because they are going to be the drivers of the future of maritime. At the same time, there is also a large pool of existing workers that we want to upskill and we want to help them to make this transition, so that we prepare them for the future.</p><p>22. MPA offers the Global Internship Award for students to gain on-the-job training and global exposure at reputable international maritime companies in Singapore and overseas, including Norway. When I visited Wilhelmsen earlier this week, I came across two fellow Singaporeans. One of them, Jessica, was posted here to work in Oslo for two years. Her colleague, Gareth, is based in Singapore but is currently here on a work assignment.</p><p>23. Be it a longer-term attachment or short-term work assignment, these exposures are wonderful ways for our young people to learn more about one another's work culture, and to experience the dynamism of different places and people. This is something that I hope, under the MOU, we can also support.</p><p>24. We already have good collaboration on these areas, but there is space to go further. The Maritime Leadership Programme also seeks to nurture global thinking and leadership competencies for senior maritime professionals through seminars and local and overseas learning journeys. Such programmes are crucial to develop maritime talent and enable the exchange of knowledge and ideas, so that we can collectively address the evolving needs of the industry.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>25. I have covered just a few of the possibilities where Singapore and Norway can work together on, and I hope I have managed to give you a sense of some of the exciting possibilities of collaboration between our two governments, but also more importantly, between our companies. Not to forget our people - our young men and women, our existing maritime workers, or even people who are looking to the maritime industry for new opportunities, I hope you will make maritime your port of call.</p><p>26. The theme of today's session is, \"Ocean of opportunities\", and it is really something that I hope we can tap on through our strong partnerships, and may the longstanding, positive collaborations between Singapore and Norway continue to flourish in the years to come.</p><p>27. I wish everyone a fruitful seminar ahead.

It has even been launched on Indonesia's own virtual platform Jagat (meaning universe), where a talking avatar of Mr Widodo invites visitors to stroll through the virtual capital.</p><p> Just marketing or not'One can either dismiss them as gimmicks or admire the creativity behind Indonesia's Nusantara pitch.

Construction is set to ramp up in 2023, and environmentalists have expressed fears about deforestation.</p><p> Separately, Jakarta-based financial analyst Adi Wijaya thinks it is unlikely that Nusantara will become a fintech hub because of difficulties in attracting talent and infrastructural issues. He says there is no guarantee of a flood of private investments, while noting that thus far only government facilities are on the drawing board or being constructed.</p><p> He believes Balikpapan, a city some 90km away from the new capital, is better suited for such a role. Balikpapan can cope with existing infrastructure as it has been a centre of industry, trade and commerce for a long time. Furthermore, Balikpapan is closer to the submarine Internet cable network directly linked to both Japan and the United States, he said.</p><p> The scramble to promote Nusantara suggests there is a palpable concern in Jakarta that the project has fallen short of its objective in securing foreign funding.</p><p> Nusantara's woes began when Japanese giant Softbank pulled out of the project in March 2022, knocking some wind out of investment prospects for the mammoth project. The scramble to rope in other potential investors began in earnest after the Softbank pullout.</p><p> In March, Nusantara Capital City Authority (NCCA) secretary Achmad Jaka Santos Adiwijaya announced that 150 prospective investors from Europe, the Middle East, China, Malaysia and South Korea, among others, had submitted letters of intent (LOIs) to take part in the construction of the new capital.</p><p> Difficult to assessAssessing real interest in Nusantara is difficult because investing in it is as much a political decision as a business one. Touted as Mr Widodo's signature legacy project, the new capital has inadvertently become a conduit through which different countries hope to leverage their soft power over Indonesia.</p><p> Investing in Nusantara is akin to a vote of confidence in Indonesia's future prospects. Its promotion has, in a way, become a new central focus of Indonesian economic diplomacy.</p><p> It is no wonder that foreign governments feel, out of respect for Indonesian sensibilities, a need to express at least tentative interest in the project.</p><p> During a February meeting with the newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, Mr Widodo made another pitch for Nusantara, to which the former responded by saying China would \"expand its investment in Indonesia in the areas of green infrastructure and the digital economy\", albeit without mentioning Nusantara specifically.</p><p> Several Chinese consortiums were indeed among those who sent their LOIs to NCCA, including China Harbour, CSSC (Hong Kong) Shipping Company, China Communications Construction Company, China National Technical Import and Export Corporation (CNTIC), Sinopec, Power China, China State Construction Engineering, China Urban Rural Holdings Group, State Power Investment Corporation and China CCK Power Indonesia.</p><p> Chinese companies are also expected to invest in another of Indonesia's mega infrastructure projects, North Kalimantan's 30,000ha Green Industrial Park, claimed to be the world's largest site for the production of sustainable energy sources. With total investment estimated to be worth US$132 billion, the park is scheduled to be operational by 2024. </p><p> For geopolitical reasons, Indonesia is seeking to diversify funding sources for Nusantara, mostly because it is keen to avoid over-relying on any particular country.</p><p>Russia has also waded into the project. Its ambassador to Jakarta, Ms Lyudmila Vorobieva, told Indonesian media in December 2022 that her country wanted to play a role in Nusantara's development, suggesting technology transfer from Moscow was on the cards.</p><p> Whether Indonesia will succeed in projecting a semblance of non-alignment in relation to Nusantara remains to be seen. </p><p> Mr Widodo's overture to the Chinese foreign minister was a two-way bait. While Chinese investment is always welcome, it may have the advantage of eliciting counter-bids from those opposed to Chinese interests. </p><p> The tug-of-war between Japan and China in the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Train project is well documented.</p><p> In 2015, Japan lost out to China after the former's offer of a US$6.2 billion loan package was trumped by China's US$5.5 billion bid. Built under China's Belt and Road Initiative, Mr Widodo's first high-profile infrastructure project was supposed to have been finished by 2019 but has run into difficulties, including a temporary halt during the Covid-19 pandemic. By 2022, its estimated cost had also ballooned to US$7.5 billion, much to Indonesia's dismay and frustration.</p><p> Less than two weeks after President Widodo's meeting with Mr Qin Gang, an Indonesian delegation was in Tokyo lobbying the Japanese Business Federation (Keidanren).</p><p> The newly appointed NCCA deputy fund manager Agung Wicaksono and the Ministry of Public Works' NCCA task force head Danis Hidayat Sumadilaga presented the case for Nusantara. Mr Wicaksono noted on his Instagram post that Japan had always been a long-time development partner for Indonesia. </p><p> Little to show so far Indonesia's Nusantara investment outreach so far has little to show by way of concrete results.</p><p> Only three corporate entities are currently involved in construction projects in Nusantara: China Construction First Group Corp (CCFG)-Risjadson Burnsfield Nusantara Consortium, tasked to build 60 apartment towers to accommodate Indonesian military personnel, Indonesian property developer Summarecon Agung, which has been allotted six towers, and Korea Land and Housing Corp, 23 towers.</p><p> These are, however, contractors rather than investors since the cost of their projects, which could total up to US$2.7 billion, will be borne by the state.</p><p> Prospective investors will likely wait and see until the country's 2024 elections are over before making any decision. Mr Widodo will have to leave office in 2024 at the end of his second and final term under the Constitution.</p><p> Two of the three leading contenders to succeed him -- Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto and Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo -- have been unequivocal in their support for the continuation of the project. Former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, who opposed it in the past, has recently changed his tune, saying that if he is elected president, he will see it to completion.</p><p> The clock, however, is ticking for Indonesia. Building a new capital city from scratch is no easy feat. Nevertheless, Mr Widodo insists the new presidential palace will be ready for all to \"celebrate Indonesia's Independence Day (on Aug 17)\" in the new capital in 2024, and for the handover of power two months later.</p><p> Johannes Nugroho is a journalist and political analyst from Surabaya, Indonesia.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Its promotion has, in a way, become a new central focus of Indonesian economic diplomacy.

From the news stories on the impact of rising sea levels and temperatures and biodiversity loss, to realisations of increasing costs of fuel and groceries at the petrol station or supermarket. Or even when we walk out the door and complain about the unbearable heat. The world is literally on fire, yet it seems that we are not quite doing enough to stop it.In the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released in April, United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres gave a stark assessment of global progress towards tackling climate change. </p><p>\"This report of the IPCC is a litany of broken climate promises. It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unliveable world\", he said.Here in South-east Asia, climate change is a crucial issue we must tackle. The region remains exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, from environmental degradation, erratic weather and natural catastrophes to rising sea levels and temperatures and resultant forest fires that destroy homes and habitats. These climate events affect South-east Asia's key sectors such as agriculture, fishing and tourism, with the region facing a risk of losing more than 35 per cent of its gross domestic product by 2050.The whole ecosystem must work towards a just transition The world must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a key benchmark in limiting global damage caused by climate change. To do so it will require a transformation of the global economy from one that has been powered by fossil fuels to one that no longer depends on them.However, South-east Asia has been reliant on fossil fuels to drive massive economic expansion, urbanisation and industrialisation in the past two decades. An unbalanced shift towards decarbonisation in the region can result in tradeoffs with real-life consequences.A just transition to net zero for our region means ensuring continued operations for economic development in tandem with replacing high-emitting technologies with low-emitting or carbon-free alternatives. Our priority must be to deliver environmental commitments that incorporate energy security as well as economic and social equity and quality.There needs to be leadership, collaboration and action from all stakeholders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c governments and regulators, consumers, investors, financial institutions and the real economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to ensure a sustainable future.Singapore to lead the way in financing South-east Asia's net zero transition The exponential growth of the region's green financial ecosystem has shown us that the transition to a net zero economy is a priority for key stakeholders here. This is not just about managing environmental risk: decarbonisation is a generation-defining business opportunity.Singapore has an opportunity to lead this just transformation through connecting people and businesses within Asean. We have seen this leadership take shape in the financial ecosystem.Singapore is home to the Asia-Pacific arm of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of leading financial institutions that aims to help bridge global investors' net zero concerns with the actual needs of South-east Asia. One of GFANZ's key focus is to shape regional net zero sectoral pathways that will be recognised by investors adhering to established standards and taxonomies.Such pathways provide a useful benchmark for financial institutions to shape their investments and financial services to be in line with the net zero transition in particular sectors, which can create fundamental shifts on an industry scale. This will help enable more private capital to be channelled from developed markets to drive sustainable development of the region and facilitate a just transition to net zero.In particular, transition financing will be crucial to support the transition of high-carbon and hard-to-abate sectors, such as oil and gas, including the decommissioning of existing assets without leaving their operations stranded in the process.Further, public-private partnerships will play a critical role in fostering collaboration and managing private-sector risks and public-sector costs. According to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) estimates, Asean governments will need the private sector to fund 40 per cent of infrastructure investments. The ADB's Asean Catalytic Green Finance Facility Fund, which targets to attract US$3 of commercial capital per dollar of public capital spend, is one such example.A report by Microsoft and Temasek estimated that more than half of the US$2 trillion investment needs in the region will likely be in sectors such as renewable energy, transportation and the built environment. With investors increasingly seeking high-quality assets and projects that meet international sustainability standards, making South-east Asia's green infrastructure projects bankable will be critical.Collective efforts critical to building our net zero future in Asean This green industrial revolution won't happen through the efforts of one sector, one company or one individual. The end goal of transitioning to a net zero economy is to ensure that people can lead better lives while securing the sustainability of their future. If a zero carbon economy can only be possible at the expense of the livelihoods of our local communities, it would hardly be counted as a victory for the path towards net zero.As a bank, it is not just about bringing our financing portfolio to net zero. Even if we do so but the real economy does not achieve net zero, then collectively as a global community we have failed. To achieve real impact, we need to drive sustainability that is inclusive and progressive. By making a collective effort to support our clients through advisory and provide access to sustainable financing and green solutions, we will help companies in the region with their transition to net zero.As the saying goes, if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.

Over the last two years, an average of around 3,840 firms were deregistered each month, similar to the period of 2017-2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, an average of more than 5,000 new firms were registered each month over the last two years, reflecting an increase in the total number of businesses operating in Singapore, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>2. In the last two years, the Government has committed substantial resources to help our businesses weather the immediate impact of COVID-19. We are also helping our businesses prepare for post Covid-19 recovery and continuing to enhance Singapore's position as a business hub in several ways.</p><p>3. First, we are strengthening both our physical and digital connectivity. For example, we are gradually and carefully reopening our borders to more countries through arrangements such as the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs). Our ports are kept operating throughout the pandemic to ensure supply chain resilience. We will continue to enhance both our air and sea connectivity.</p><p>4. The Government is similarly extending Singapore's digital connectivity by establishing a network of Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs) with like-minded partners. We are also investing in digital infrastructure and capability building for our businesses and workers to access such opportunities. For example, the Grow Digital initiative helps SMEs tap on established e-commerce platforms to better access global markets, while the Enterprise Development Grant encourages SMEs to transform and strengthen their capabilities. In addition, we are partnering industry stakeholders in this endeavour. An example is the SGTraDex, which is a common data infrastructure that enables businesses to transit into the digital domain. It also builds a stronger and more robust supply chain ecosystem for international trade flows.</p><p>5. Second, we are supporting our businesses in capturing new and emerging opportunities, such as those from the green sector. As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 announced this year, we will help our enterprises and workforce harness sustainability as a competitive advantage, and develop innovative solutions for the green economy. These include, among others, carbon trading and related services, low-carbon solutions, green finance, and green infrastructure. Enterprise Singapore recently launched the Enterprise Sustainability Programme which supports businesses, especially SMEs, to build capabilities and capture new opportunities in this exciting space.</p><p>6. Third, we are helping businesses transform for the future economy, sector by sector. The Future Economy Council is currently refreshing the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) to meet the accelerated changes brought about by COVID-19. For each of the 23 ITM sectors, we are working with our tripartite partners to update our sectoral strategies to seize new opportunities, as well as improve the productivity and wages of workers through digitalisation, innovation, internationalisation, upskilling and job redesign.</p><p>7. These are the fundamentals which underpin our competitiveness and ensure that Singapore remains as a global-Asia node for technology, innovation and enterprise.</p><p>8.

That ability to borrow at such long maturities reflected the country's credit strength, he explained, highlighting that Singapore is 1 out of only 9 sovereigns globally, and the only 1 in Asia, that has been rated AAA by all three ratings agencies. </p><p> Sovereign bonds are often used in bond markets to provide pricing benchmarks from which yields are determined for other debt instruments.

The only other Singapore-dollar denominated bond with a tenor of 50 years in the market is issued by state investor Temasek, which priced S$1.5 billion worth of bonds at a 2.8 per cent yield in Aug 2021.

The roll-out of vaccines should help contain the spread, but that will be a prolonged process. It will not be until well into the second half of 2021, at best, that the pandemic may possibly be brought under control. In these circumstances, economies will need continued fiscal support from governments. US lawmakers agreed on a new US$900 billion (S$1.2 trillion) package of relief measures - which President Donald Trump has now rejected - on top of the more than US$2 trillion passed earlier. This would have brought the total fiscal support this year to more than 13 per cent of gross domestic product. The incoming administration of president-elect Joe Biden has pledged even more stimulus next year.</p><p> Many European countries which are reeling from repeated lockdowns will also almost certainly need to step up fiscal assistance from already record levels. In October, the International Monetary Fund cautioned that one of the biggest risks in responding to the economic impact of the pandemic would be a premature withdrawal of fiscal support. That is even more true now.</p><p> It also applies to Singapore. Although the Government has pledged close to $100 billion in spending in response to the pandemic - equal to about 20 per cent of GDP - and is likely to run a record fiscal deficit of more than 15 per cent of GDP this financial year, there is a case for continued fiscal support. With the economy starting to recover, this would need to be carefully targeted.

Ahead of Feb 14, The Edge Singapore gathered predictions and wishlists from consultants, corporates and advocates that are specific to Singapore's sustainability agenda. From climate adaptation strategies to tax incentives on green buildings, they emphasise a need to balance decarbonisation goals with support for businesses amid the green transition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At last year's Budget, Wong, who is also the deputy prime minister, announced Singapore's plans to reach net-zero emissions by or around 2050, bringing the previous timeline forward by up to 50 years. The government updated this plan in October 2022 to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Taimur Baig, managing director and chief economist at DBS Bank, Budget 2023 will mark a shift from emergency spending and allocation to deal with the pandemic to a more conventional one. The government had committed around $100 billion to support the economy when Covid-19 hit.</p><p>\"The country's current target is to reduce emissions to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, after peaking emissions earlier,\" says Baig. \"We expect these high-level targets to inform all budgets going forward and we anticipate more announcements on initiatives advancing decarbonisation.\"</p><p>Last year, Wong also announced that by 2030, Singapore's government and statutory boards would issue up to $35 billion in green bonds to fund public sector green infrastructure projects, such as charging points for electric vehicles (EVs).</p><p>To further encourage the adoption of EVs, input tax should be claimable on GST incurred for related expenses, says Yeo Kai Eng, EY's Asean indirect tax leader. \"Likewise, expenses incurred on EVs by businesses should be fully tax-deductible and capital allowances claimable on the purchase of EVs.\"</p><p>Industry and transport are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, says DBS's Baig, and Singapore, as a key global transportation node, has \"a major role\" in decarbonising the shipping and aviation sectors. \"Recent budgets contained measures to facilitate private adoption of cleaner energy vehicles; we expect to see more such announcements this year.\"</p><p>Among last year's announcements was a hike in carbon taxes, with Singapore's carbon tax rate set to rise up to 16 times the current rate of $5 per tonne of emissions by 2030. The first hike to $25 per tonne is expected in 2024, after Parliament passed the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill on Nov 8, 2022.</p><p>While the carbon tax rate hike is a \"welcome move\", Baig calls for targeted technical and financial support to further ease the transition for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p><p>Woo Qiyun, sustainability consultant at Singapore-headquartered climate-tech start-up Unravel Carbon, hopes the government can encourage companies of various sizes to measure and report their emissions, particularly from their supply chains. \"This would mean increased support for SMEs to begin embarking on this effort, and also to develop strong standards to encourage comparable, verifiable and robust sustainability reporting.\"</p><p>For residents, carbon taxes may lead to a \"modest rise\" in household utility bills, says DBS's Baig. \"Some cash support or rebates would help to cushion those in the lower-income bracket.\"</p><p>Woo hopes gains from carbon taxes can be apportioned to vulnerable groups. \"While there are GST vouchers, it would be timely to consider ringfencing a portion of environmental taxes, such as the carbon tax, towards supporting communities who will bear the brunt of increased living costs.\"</p><p>Post-pandemic, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has been updating its Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), which outlines strategies for 23 major industry sectors to adapt and grow. First launched in 2017, Wong unveiled the revised 2025 roadmap for the financial sector in October 2022.

A large portion of the costs of these upgrades can be offset through grants. Hence, we expect Budget 2023 to expand on the support to encourage companies to make the green transition.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, the energy transition will continue to be a key focus area, says Xylia Sim, energy and infrastructure counsel at global law firm Linklaters. \"Green hydrogen has the potential to be a low-carbon alternative to promote the decarbonisation of high-carbon sectors. In Singapore, this could help with decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, such as shipping and aviation, while supporting Singapore's energy security.\"</p><p>Singapore launched its national hydrogen strategy last October, estimating that the low-carbon fuel could supply half of the republic's power needs by 2050.

There is no better reminder of our shared future as one humanity than this pandemic. The theme of this EXPO - to jointly build a shared future - is most timely. Trade between ASEAN and China have flourished since dialogue relations were established thirty years ago. Despite COVID-19, trade grew in 2020 and is now worth more than US$500 billion. We are now each other's largest trading partners.</p><p>Looking ahead, ASEAN and China will benefit further from closer economic integration, especially with a fast-growing digital economy and an expanding middle class.</p><p>The Corridor</p><p>In particular, we can explore how ASEAN and China can collaborate on the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative - New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor. Started as an initiative between Singapore and China, the Corridor has the potential to benefit the wider region as an alternative trade route. During my visit to Chongqing in 2019, I witnessed first-hand the extent of the Corridor's network and its immense potential. By providing a more direct link between Western China and Southeast Asia, the Corridor reduces the time and cost for the movement of goods and the provision of services between these fast-growing regions and beyond. Last year, despite COVID-19, we saw a 30 per cent year-on-year increase in trade volume along the Corridor. We can further build on this growth momentum.</p><p>Strengthening Trade</p><p>Beyond the Corridor, ASEAN and China should continue our cooperation to strengthen the rules-based multilateral framework for trade and investments. We should work towards upgrading the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement to further reduce non-tariff measures and address new priorities to keep up with the times. Digital collaboration will be a key building block. By leveraging on existing platforms such as the ASEAN Smart Cities Network, we can make faster progress.</p><p>We should also rebuild our air links and further liberalise the ASEAN-China Air Transport Agreement to boost regional connectivity. Air travel in the post-pandemic world will be different. But strong air links will remain critical to economic recovery, and in deepening mutual understanding between our peoples. Beyond ASEAN and China, the RCEP promotes greater integration in the region. Singapore and China have ratified the RCEP, and we look forward to the RCEP coming into force. Through greater economic cooperation, we can grow our companies and improve the lives of people in the region.</p><p>Sustainable Development</p><p>Apart from economic cooperation, sustainable development is another important area of partnership. We designated this year as the ASEAN-China Year of Sustainable Development Cooperation. Southeast Asia is home to the world's largest blue carbon stock and has significant potential to contribute to nature-based solutions for carbon sequestration. Initiatives such as the ASEAN-China Environment Cooperation Strategy and Action Plan, and the BRI International Green Development Coalition can catalyse knowledge exchanges, joint projects, and investment opportunities. Within ASEAN, the Catalytic Green Finance Facility provides loans and technical assistance for green infrastructure projects. With a focus on sustainable development, we can leave behind a greener planet for our children.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The relationship between ASEAN and China has grown from strength to strength since formal dialogue relations began three decades ago.</p><p>Let us work closely together to broaden and deepen this cooperation, and do our part in the global community, in the next 30 years and beyond.

Last year, Indonesia's financial regulator set up a sustainable finance task force to develop the country's sustainable finance ecosystem. In Malaysia, a new capital market masterplan is focusing on the use of sustainability-related factors in investment decision processes, transparency of environmental, social and governance (ESG) data providers, as well as disclosures and governance among credit and ESG ratings agencies.</p><p>At the same time, we will see ever-increasing government, consumer and investor pressure on businesses to divest high carbon assets, acquire green technology, publish and track progress on their step to net zero. In order to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century, the Singapore government will raise carbon tax progressively \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it will be S$50 to S$80 per tonne by 2030.</p><p>\"With the coming increase in carbon taxes in 2024, businesses will need to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to pivot towards a low carbon and energy-efficient solution,\" says Ms Amy Ang, EY Asia-Pacific Financial Services Tax Leader. </p><p>For financial services, the accelerating demand for carbon transition finance (precipitating both carbon savings and excellent returns), climate risk insurance and sustainable investments, will be a game changer.

Nine in 10 employees want flexibility in where and when they work. Notably, three in five would consider leaving their jobs if these options aren't available after the pandemic.</p><p>As new Covid-19 variants continue to emerge this year, institutions will need to manage a dual workforce of on- and off-site workers, with staff empowered to transition to new ways of working at a moment's notice. Apart from the technology needed to ensure a seamless employee experience, this will also require a focus on fairness to diffuse the inevitable \"us and them\" mentality.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/adobe-stock-333194282.jpg\">https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/adobe-stock-333194282.jpg</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">According to the EY 2021 Work Reimagined Employee Survey, nine in 10 employees want flexibility in where and when they work.

They must also proactively support workers whose traditional roles are being automated to upskill and take on higher value activities.</p><p>\"The workforce of the insurer needs to be reimagined and changed. While traditional skills in risk management, actuarial and finance continue to be critical, marrying the power of people and technology will be a vital ingredient for a successful insurance enterprise of the future,\" says Mr Brandon Bruce, EY Asean Insurance Leader.</p><p>In this environment, D&amp;I (diversity and inclusiveness) must expand to become DE&amp;I \u00e2\u20ac\u201c  where the \"E\" stands for \"equity\". This represents equity of experience, equity of opportunity and equity of reward. </p><p>A key lesson from the pandemic is how easy it is for businesses and markets to become disassociated from their employees and customers. Institutions must remember that, ultimately, they rely on the ingenuity, hard work and loyalty of real people. </p><p>To both retain scarce talent and support their social licence to operate, institutions must redesign their employee value propositions to provide a fertile environment for career development, a competitive compensation package and a strong emphasis on well-being, spearheaded by empathetic leadership.</p><p>3. Enable hyper-personalisation, empower your customers </p><p>Many of South-east Asia's banks have been cautious during the pandemic, resulting in increasingly commoditised products and services. No wonder our latest <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ey.com/en_sg/banking-capital-markets/how-can-banks-transform-for-a-new-generation-of-customers'WT.mc_id=10469416&amp;AA.tsrc=display\">Global Consumer Banking Survey</url> found that 35 per cent of Asia-Pacific consumers have relationships with neobanks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by far the highest rate of adoption in any region in the world. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/getty-865596966.jpg\">https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/getty-865596966.jpg</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EY research has shown that Singapore consumers value personalised services and are motivated to expand their relationships with financial providers who understand them and offer customised products that meet their individual needs. Photo: EY</emphasis></p><p>Our region's consumers are becoming highly sophisticated, with new generations especially expecting a seamless integration of financial services into their daily lives. EY surveys of South-east Asia's wealth and banking consumers, including small businesses, all highlight growing demand for a slick experience that integrates all their financial services across providers as well as extend to non-financial offerings.</p><p>\"EY research shows that Singaporean consumers particularly value personalisation that helps maximise functional benefits linked to products, such as loyalty programmes. Other valued personalised experiences include communications that show their provider knows them, the right product offers at the right time and the ability to customise products. Respondents say such offers would motivate them to expand their relationship with their preferred financial providers,\" says Mr Andrew Gilder, EY Asia-Pacific Banking and Capital Markets Leader.</p><p>To meet this need, institutions must shift from product-focused delivery and look at customer journeys from a human-centric perspective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c understanding that personalised experiences drive consumption. It's not about banks selling consumers a generic mortgage or a motor loan, but providing people with the right finance at the right time to purchase their home or car. </p><p>The starting point is to automate and realign workflows. But this is not just about streamlining onboarding and accelerating decision-making. Institutions will also need to employ hyper-personalisation to serve customers' requirements and address financial pain-points. </p><p>It's time to use big data analytics on transactional and behavioural information to enhance segmentation, provide tailored value propositions, and deliver the right levels and types of engagement. </p><p>Incumbents also have a significant opportunity to be the unifying point for consumers' multiple financial relationships via a super app \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially given their trust advantage when it comes to protecting personal data.  </p><p>Unshackling from legacy systems has become critical in 2022</p><p>While the focus of the above three changes is about people, their enabling force is technology. Intelligent automation, artificial intelligence, analytics, blockchain and super apps will all be needed to support new business strategies. </p><p>We therefore expect that 2022 will be the last year where financial services incumbents can continue to rely on legacy systems. </p><p>\"To remain relevant, institutions have no option but to embrace digital transformation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c building, buying, or collaborating with fintechs to rapidly develop agile operating models with automated workflows supported by rich data insights,\" says Mr Brian Thung, EY Asean Financial Services Leader.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2\">Futurists predict</url> that three-quarters of the industry's larger enterprises in the S&amp;P500 could be displaced in the next five years.

It's not a particularly new theme, I would dare to venture, and is in most part a sensible approach to investing. The socially responsible have been shunning direct investments in \"sin\" stocks such as alcohol, gambling or tobacco firms for many years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;IMPORTANCE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Fast forward to 2022 and with extreme weather events happening more frequently, investors are more attuned to the impact of climate change or the \"E\" in ESG. But the \"S\" and \"G\" are making their way to the forefront of their consciousness too. \"Social\" includes areas such as the firm's gender and age-based diversity, employment turnover as well as its relationships with suppliers, customers and the wider community.</p><p> Governance metrics address topics such as board composition and the company's commitment to ESG, management diversity, ethical behaviour and alignment with industry frameworks.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;HOW TO TELL BETWEEN SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;While comparing the profit levels of two companies is straightforward, evaluating which company performs better in the ESG stakes is where things get a bit fuzzy.</p><p> Eastspring Investments notes in its 2022 Market Outlook that data can be an obstacle in building ESG factors into an investment process. Different agencies use different standards and metrics; or there is insufficient data.</p><p> Some fund managers develop their own investment approach.</p><p> Schroders, for example, points out that \"E\" often takes centre stage because emissions is a criterion that is quantifiable and measurable. It cites the example of reviewing European wind turbine manufacturers, which naturally score highly for \"E\". But these may not be automatic choices for Schroders which takes a more rounded approach that also considers the social or governance practices such as the quality of the business' management teams.</p><p> For a retail investor, such an activist approach may yield higher returns from the fund manager getting up close and personal with the company but you have to understand these managers' methodologies to see if they gel with yours.</p><p> Investors can also opt for a more passive approach by investing in unit trusts or exchange-traded funds that track various indexes. These indexes will be screening firms based on criteria like the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p> One benchmark is the FTSE4Good family of indexes. There are products available which track the FTSE4Good US Select Index for example.</p><p> For investors who want to focus on clean energy, there are products that track the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index, which has firms from developed and emerging economies operating in clean energy-related businesses, including Vestas Wind Systems and Enphase Energy.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SHORT-TERM VS LONG-TERM&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A company that lives by ESG principles and does good - champions climate change, pays its employees well and contributes to society positively - should perform better than one that does the opposite.</p><p> But investors are often sceptical about returns as in the short term, investing in positive practices costs money and could eat into profits. Take the issue of climate change and the phasing out of dirty fuels such as coal.</p><p> In many parts of Asia, a large existing stock of coal plants and mines continues to be a key source of energy and jobs. But much resources will be needed to build new green infrastructure or repurpose existing ones. In the short term, investing in such firms, even if they are in transformation mode, may not yield the requisite returns for the investor.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;COSTS AND RETURNS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Investors may want to look at one-, five-and 10-year returns to see if the fund does deliver both over the short and long run. Expense ratios are also important. Investors can usually start small with an initial investment although there may be costs for each additional tranche.</p><p> Digital wealth platform Endowus here has around 350 funds on offer which have both ESG and non-ESG focus, so there is plenty of choice for investors. For its core ESG portfolio, the return in 2021 would have outperformed the broader market if not for the recent surge in commodity and energy prices. Still, the portfolio has done well in the past few years. Endowus chairman Samuel Rhee is confident \"ESG funds and portfolios do not need to sacrifice returns and will add value over the long term\".</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Many investors start off investing based on themes such as technology or real estate that they are more familiar with. Over time, they are likely to include ESG factors in their investing decisions because who doesn't want to feel they are doing good with their investments'</p><p> But it is also not just about feeling good as an investor. Paying attention to ESG metrics could well save your capital as it highlights the risk of remaining invested in a company that is doing well but is operating in an environmentally unfriendly sector, for example.</p><p> ESG may come across as a marketing tool, but it can protect your investment as well.</p><p> \u00b7 Do send comments, feedback and questions to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sushyan@sph.com.sg\">sushyan@sph.com.sg</email></p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Take the issue of climate change and the phasing out of dirty fuels such as coal.

While nature groups and environmental scientists have long pointed out the link between climate and biodiversity crises, climate solutions have neglected biodiversity in favour of renewable energy or green technology development. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The recent COP15 in Montreal ratified a new post-2020 Biodiversity Framework, with notable elements in setting aside 30 per cent of the earth's land and oceans for the protection of nature, and restoring at least 30 per cent of the world's degraded habitats. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This is particularly important for the majestic forests, rich coral reefs, wetlands and tropical peatlands in South-east Asia. But critical ecosystems need considerable human assistance to recover. Degraded habitats, particularly peatlands, emit a tremendous amount of carbon dioxide, which causes climate change, more volatile and extreme weather and consequently an increase in natural disasters such as landslides or flooding. </p><p> Healthy ecosystems, on the other hand, store unimaginably large amounts of carbon, buffering us against the dangers of climate instability. What's critical is a strategic approach to land management, integrating efficient agricultural production with the protection of healthy and diverse habitats, while degraded landscapes are being restored. </p><p> Currently, the mammoth task to restore habitats has highlighted how South-east Asia lacks a coordinated vision, with its initiatives scattered across the region. While an international mandate to restore degraded habitats is a laudable and necessary step, a strong framework and a mechanism to translate policy into meaningful action and outcomes are a must. </p><p> In this regard, the announcement in 2022 that the European Commission had tabled a Nature Restoration Law, which will impose binding targets on member states to facilitate the recovery of nature, offers policymakers in South-east Asia a formula to reflect on. </p><p> The law, which remains to be passed, creates a framework that will see EU member states restore a variety of degraded habitats including forests, peatlands, wetlands, grasslands and seagrass meadows. It will see them attempt to reverse the decline of pollinators, prevent net loss of green urban spaces, maintain a minimum level of canopy cover in European cities, increase farmland diversity, as well as improve the quality and flow of rivers. </p><p> There will undoubtedly be much discussion between the European Commission and member states on implementing these obligations nationally. The final result may well be an uneven tapestry negotiated in the back rooms of European politics rather than a legislative tour de force. Nevertheless, the proposed law is an instrument of laudable ambition and appears to embrace several key principles of environmental protection and governance. </p><p> First, traditional narratives on the co-existence of nature and development are replaced by a firmer and more holistic acceptance that nature plays a part in economic growth, climate resilience, food and water security, clean air and water, as well as physical and mental health.  In the wake of Covid-19, the law exposes the consequences from a rapacious relationship with nature, and is a clarion call for green recovery and growth. </p><p> Second, the law accepts that nature is in a state of crisis, and that restoration rectifies consequential maladies while seeking to deliver both ecological functionality and human well-being. </p><p> Third, it is premised on the benefits of a collective and coordinated approach across a political geography rather than a reliance only on well-meaning national initiatives. </p><p> Finally, it accepts that restoration must embrace a variety of carefully considered approaches and modalities that go beyond well-choreographed tree-planting initiatives. These potentially include giving nature the space to recover and incentivising those who facilitate recovery. Implicit in the law is also the notion that, if we pursue restoration as assiduously as we should, green jobs would follow along with economic growth. </p><p> Few would contest the validity and applicability of these principles to South-east Asia, where it is acknowledged that uneven weather patterns and natural disasters will increasingly impact economic growth and resilience, leaving the poor the most affected. </p><p> Can restoring biodiversity in South-east Asia be achieved within the framework of a far more conservative political instrument like Asean? It does not have the mandate to bind member states and enforce obligations. Non-interference in the internal affairs of states is a sacrosanct principle, and economic prerogatives are guarded fiercely. </p><p> With decisions taken by consensus, it's always challenging to achieve common understanding across a bloc where economic development is uneven, cultural experience more varied, and a more structured union is not envisaged. Yet, it is arguable that the principles that the law embraces can find a home within the unique vision that is Asean.  </p><p> Asean initiatives have already embraced the restoration pathway. The Asean Centre for Biodiversity, through the Asean Green Initiative and its Biodiversity Conservation Programme, is already well positioned to facilitate and coordinate the restoration of ecosystems. Asean has also come together in the context of the Asean Peatland Management Strategy to address the sustainable management of peatlands. </p><p> Although Asean cannot mandate or enforce, it can play a significant role to convene, influence and connect.</p><p> ConveneIn their respective countries, member states have organically fashioned solutions that can be utilised more broadly in delivering restoration agendas. </p><p>Cambodia has become a leader in securing nature through carbon financing. The Philippines has been the clearest in linking the benefits of restoration to poverty reduction, youth engagement and corporate responsibility through its National Greening Programme. Indonesia has offered insights into how restoration can take place at scale with its national peatland restoration strategy and its championing of Ecosystem Restoration Concessions, which envision the private management of landscapes to facilitate restoration. </p><p>Singapore has developed and implemented thinking around the greening of cities through the Centre for Urban Greenery and Ecology. Asean is well positioned to pull these threads together and orchestrate a collective understanding and conversation on the possibilities around restoration. </p><p> Influence Given that sustainable and green growth is contingent on a positive relationship with nature, Asean can encourage the scaling up of economic initiatives and growth trajectories that facilitate restoration. The Asean Catalytic Green Finance Facility and the Asean Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance already support this pathway. Other initiatives benefiting the Asean region offer replicable models that speak more directly to the restoration agenda.</p><p> In October 2021, the Asian Development Bank, backed by technical support from BirdLife International, launched a Regional Flyway Initiative employing the East Asian-Australasian Flyway as an organising principle for sustainable development. </p><p> The initiative, which includes South-east Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos and Vietnam, envisages a blended finance approach of loans and grants to support nature-positive initiatives. This includes promoting coastal resilience and economic development of communities on the margins of wetlands. </p><p> Asean can influence multilateral development agencies and commercial banks to develop similar initiatives to finance green infrastructure and nature restoration in the region. </p><p> Asean could also lead efforts to properly value nature so that its role in delivering economic growth and climate resilience is mainstreamed in decision-making at the expense of counter-arguments focused on its exploitation.</p><p> ConnectAsean can facilitate and regularise the movement of conservation finance by connecting willing funders with nationally prioritised restoration initiatives. </p><p> For instance, the decision by automotive industry leaders BMW and Pirelli to support the improvement of rubber production, forest protection and livelihoods at the Hutan Harapan Ecosystem Restoration Concession in Sumatra complements the sterling efforts of the Indonesian government to encourage growth in the region and demonstrates the role corporate sustainability projects can play in augmenting restoration initiatives. It also recognises the importance of sustaining communities that ultimately guarantee the success of these initiatives.  </p><p> Additionally, Asean is well positioned to bring market visibility to initiatives that encourage local support for conservation and restoration. Rice farmers who support the sustainable management of wetlands used by the eastern sarus crane in Cambodia have been incentivised through the branding of their produce as sustainably sourced \"crane rice\". </p><p> Similar initiatives deserve to be amplified as part of a bigger Asean story around the role of local people in sustaining natural infrastructure, to ensure that purchasing decisions reward the restoration of nature. </p><p> The fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic had inspired narratives to restore the health of ecosystems as part of a green recovery. But the Ukraine war causing a spike in the prices of food and energy may see the convenient return to short-term gains, which have historically bedevilled efforts to develop a sustainable relationship with nature. </p><p> These factors make the role and imaginative vision of both the European Union and Asean more needed than ever, as nations seek to achieve the goals of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.</p><p> Shawn Lum is president of Nature Society (Singapore).

Day to day, prices can and do change in unpredictable ways. </p><p> There is volatility associated with investing and you can go through periods where returns are disappointing for longer than you had anticipated. At times, value stocks may underperform growth stocks. But there is no reason to react to every single piece of news. </p><p> When we look at the US stock market over the past 40 years, it has usually bottomed out long before the experts declare the economy is in recession. Markets have already priced that there might be a rate hike in June or July.</p><p> Opportunities Given that, we see opportunities in global stocks, value stocks and stocks with higher profitability. We still believe in value investing and being broadly diversified. Over the past 2 1/2  years, value stocks have largely outpaced growth stocks. </p><p> Pay attention to: An inverted yield curve is saying that there aren't higher returns for longer-duration bonds. So pay attention to forward rates. A global portfolio of bonds can ensure good diversification.</p><p> The surprise decision by the Chinese government to reopen the economy last December after a long period of lockdown is a major tailwind for its economy and equity markets.</p><p> China's reopening after three years of global isolation is one of the most important developments for investors this year.</p><p> While we are neutral on global equities overall, given the uncertain outlook for inflation and monetary policy in the developed markets, we are overweight on Chinese equities which will benefit from China's renaissance. </p><p> Despite the strong rally over the past few months, Chinese equity indexes are still significantly below the February 2021 peak and valuations are not demanding.</p><p> This is especially since the earnings outlook is poised to improve, even as earnings forecasts in developed markets face the risk of more downgrades. </p><p> China's economy looks set to do well as consumer confidence improves and factory activity and supply are restored. China is poised to be the only major economy in 2023 to post improved economic growth.</p><p> The economy grew by 3 per cent in 2022, and we expect growth to pick up sharply to 5.2 per cent this year, higher than the government's target of 5 per cent. </p><p> OpportunitiesUnlike developed markets in the United States and Europe, inflation remains relatively tame in China, and the country's central bank is likely to be the only major central bank that will not increase interest rates this year. </p><p> More than that, the Chinese government has room for economic stimulus via fiscal and monetary policy, but we do not expect massive easing.</p><p> The overall tone at the recent National People's Congress was supportive of the economy and seems constructive for Chinese equities.</p><p> Key positives from the congress include the supportive policy stance towards domestic consumption; and Internet and platform, real estate and digitalised economy-related industries such as telecommunications, automation and software.</p><p> Pay attention to: There is more upside for Chinese equities, but the climb will not be linear. Investors must brace themselves for volatility, given policy and political uncertainties against the backdrop of US-China tension due to developments in Ukraine, Taiwan, and efforts by US politicians to curb China's economic threat. </p><p> Investors should not get carried away by Chinese equities and over-invest just because things are looking more upbeat. It is important to manage exposure to Chinese equities with a diversified portfolio of multiple asset classes, including equities from other countries and regions. </p><p> Those looking to invest in Chinese equities must have a strong risk appetite, take a strategic medium-term view and be prepared to ride out short-term and intermittent market volatility. </p><p> Perhaps a more balanced way to invest in Chinese equities is through funds that offer a diversified exposure to stocks instead of buying into individual names. Spreading fresh investments gradually over time instead of timing the market may also be a prudent strategy. </p><p> For those looking to buy directly into China-related companies, the reopening of the economy could benefit consumption-related firms and industries.</p><p> Companies in the technology space like Internet and platform companies could also benefit from the pickup in consumption-led recovery and an easing of regulatory restrictions. </p><p> Greater travel should also bode well for travel- and leisure-related companies. Other longer-term investment themes aligned with government policy priorities include renewables, green infrastructure, electric vehicles and industrial automation.</p><p> Overall, despite the scope for intermittent consolidation after a sharp rally in recent months, undemanding valuations and positive fundamentals offer a constructive backdrop for Chinese equities in 2023.</p><p> Over the past 30 years, many countries with high debt burdens generated economic growth via exports in a free and open globalised world. That avenue seems to be closing now.</p><p> The focus on \"friend-shoring\" and on diversifying supply chains is evidence that companies are making a concerted effort to eliminate over-dependency, even as they stay clear of domestic political pressures from governments or from customers. </p><p> For an indebted middle- or low-income economy, the range of options appears to be shrinking. Low unit labour costs are not a big enough draw, nor the promise of multi-year tax breaks, for investment in manufacturing. </p><p> We believe the short-term struggle will be in balancing higher interest costs with the need to invest more in defence, in the transition to green energy, and in pro-growth policies.</p><p> At a time when interest rates are higher and availability of finance is more constrained, the challenge of recalibrating these supply chains becomes even more complex.  </p><p> One set of winners is countries that can benefit from the recalibration of supply chains. They could be established, like Mexico, where unit labour costs are relatively low, the transport infrastructure is good and there is a sizeable pool of experienced workers as well as agile companies that can adapt quickly. </p><p> Another will be countries that have significant access to specific raw materials that are critical for semiconductors or electric vehicle batteries, and offer a stable base for manufacturing or processing. </p><p> Asean member Indonesia has the advantage of a significant consumer market. It has the fourth-biggest population in the world at 275 million. </p><p> Furthermore, with 15- to 24-year-olds representing nearly 16 per cent of the population, there is a demographic dividend in place.</p><p> At the company and sector level, companies that can address shortcomings in specialist infrastructure will do well.</p><p> The construction of liquefied natural gas terminals and short-distance pipelines, and modernising of industrial machinery for energy efficiency are some examples. </p><p> Defence companies stand to benefit in the coming decade. For those involved in the military-industrial complex, the top priority will probably be to invest in capacity expansion, providing even more scope for revenue growth in the specialist engineering sub-sector. </p><p> Pay attention to: We expect debt issuance to climb again this year, as governments seek to implement pro-growth policies and boost investment in defence, as well as deal with higher interest costs. </p><p> Currency weakness presents additional headwinds. Japan can sustain a debt-to-GDP ratio of 250 per cent, the United States could go to 150 per cent. </p><p> The key point here is that the high-income countries will be better able to deal with the service costs and continue to find a market for their issuance. </p><p> Nato membership is swelling, with neutral Sweden and Finland joining soon, and an energised political class is prioritising at least 2 per cent of GDP to be dedicated to defence. </p><p> This is not possible without issuing significant debt and, given the small production capacity in the military-industrial complex on both sides of the Atlantic, it is likely to be inflationary. </p><p> Add to this the turbo-charged drive to accelerate the green energy transition and the wave of industrial company capital expenditure to modernise industrial plants, and we see a series of inflationary waves coming over the next decade. </p><p> What the markets will struggle with is volatility of inflation and, consequently, of interest rates. </p><p> The traditional sources of long-term savings might be squeezed or even reduced over time as the working populations in mostly high-income countries shrink and their social costs increase. </p><p> Opportunities In the short term, it seems that asset prices have generally adjusted downwards, and there is optimism for economic growth. </p><p> Fixed income (such as bonds) is attractive again, but equity markets may have to temper earnings growth expectations, and inflation may remain higher than the traditional target of 2 per cent for several years.</p><p> Bottom lineInflation and concerns over an economic slowdown have not gone away entirely, but the mood among fund managers is more upbeat now. </p><p> Investment involves risk. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance or returns. </p><p> The value of investments and the income from them can go down as well as up, and you may not get back the full amount you invested.</p><p> If you are in doubt, you should consult your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor or other professional advisers. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Companies in the technology space like Internet and platform companies could also benefit from the pickup in consumption-led recovery and an easing of regulatory restrictions.

As a result, SMEs are looking for a trusted banking partner to scale their businesses and get faster access to working capital through digital banking and transformational solutions.Leading UK financial publication Euromoney recognised DBS for being exactly that when they named it the World's Best SME Bank and Asia's Best SME Bank just last month. Euromoney lauded DBS for being all about digital innovation, and for applying its technological advantage to benefit SMEs. Louise Bowman, editor of Euromoney, said: \"DBS has applied its customary digital innovation to the SME space with great success.\"\"DBS has applied its customary digital innovation to the SME space with great success.\" - Louise Bowman, editor of Euromoney Helping SMEs reap the dividends of digital innovationOne key benefit of having a best-in-class banking partner is the unparalleled convenience of accessing end-to-end digital solutions like account opening, collections, payments, working capital and other credit solutions. </p><p>DBS' industry-leading digital lending process \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first in Singapore to be fully digital from application to disbursement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has proved critical to SMEs looking to shore up their balance sheets to cope with economic headwinds.Ng Yee Jie, founder and CEO of Ordinary Kind, an omni-channel retailer in furniture and baby goods, recounted the difficulties he faced in getting a loan from other banks as he was grounded in Malaysia at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. \"It would have been impossible for me to come down to Singapore to meet a banker and sign the necessary documents, given the border restrictions.\" However, DBS was able to approve and fulfil the loan remotely and digitally in what Ng described as \"not just a timesaver, but also a real lifesaver\".\"DBS' digital loan application, approval and disbursement process was not just a timesaver, but also a real lifesaver.\" - Ng Yee Jie, founder and CEO of Ordinary KindDBS has continued to improve its lending process to SMEs, and, today, access to working capital has been reduced to just a minute to apply, a second to approve and, in some instances, even instant disbursement. All these available within a single easy-to-use platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c DBS IDEAL.As a result of the bank's robust credit processes and enhanced digital lending, DBS has approved more than 16,300 collateral-free loans totalling more than S$7 billion to SMEs in Singapore, with over 90 per cent of the loans going to micro and small enterprises since 2020. With cash flow as the lifeblood of SMEs, another key benefit of DBS' digital prowess is the proactive management of credit quality. Through the innovative use of artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced data analytics, SMEs now receive early alerts of potential credit risks even before the problems present themselves. By putting these risks on their radar, DBS can now partner businesses to act pre-emptively and nip potential credit issues in the bud. Joyce Tee, group head of SME Banking, said: \"As SMEs emerge from the pandemic, they are walking into intensifying macro-economic headwinds, geopolitical tensions and supply chain turmoil. In all operating environments, we will continue to partner our SMEs to proactively manage their cash-flow and liquidity needs while cheering them on to keep up the momentum of their digital transformation and business expansion journeys.\"Strong regional ecosystems to supercharge SMEs' growthSMEs are increasingly looking beyond working capital solutions and increasingly value banking partners that can offer regional insights and networks to power their growth. SMEs looking to tap the potential of Asia's economic engines including China, India and Indonesia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c South-east Asia's largest economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often name DBS as their partner of choice, given the bank's deep expertise in those markets.SMEs are also benefiting from DBS' early moves to embed itself in regional ecosystems partnerships. DBS offers client programmes and has 15 platform partnerships where DBS' products and solutions are embedded into the large corporate client, or anchors, or the platform partner's ecosystem. An example is a collaboration that DBS has forged with JD Logistics (JDL) in China and Hong Kong. Via an integrated one-stop solution on JDL's platform, merchants can view their available limits, outstanding loan amounts and initiate financing requests where funds will be automatically disbursed into their bank accounts. Transforming SMEs into businesses for impactWith sustainability now a top priority for the business community, SMEs are also looking for a banking partner that can catalyse their transformation into businesses that have a positive environmental and social impact even as they manage the day-to-day operations of their businesses.Since last year, SMEs have been supported by more than S$100 million in green financing to scale businesses in sectors such as clean energy, green infrastructure, and clean transportation. Singapore-based Terrenus Energy received such a loan from DBS which enabled it to install 40,000 portable solar photovoltaic panels in Singapore. Furthermore, DBS will be offering green renovation loans to encourage SMEs to undergo sustainability retrofits for their commercial and industrial properties.SMEs looking to transition towards more sustainable business models can also tap the new DBS Foundation SME Grant Programme, which provides grants of up to S$100,000 to support such moves. This is in addition to the support that DBS has extended to social enterprises around the region since 2014.DBS has supported over 800 social enterprises through capacity-building programmes and awarded more than S$10 million in grants to some 90 social enterprises. Singapore-based Magorium, which builds roads made from recycled plastic waste, is an example of how DBS is nurturing the next generation of businesses for impact. With the help of a grant offered by the DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Grant Programme, Magorium is well on track to processing up to 200 tonnes of unrecyclable plastic waste to construct eco-friendly roads in Singapore.\"Beyond the grant support, we were connected with mentors who provided valuable guidance in areas such as financial modelling.\" - Oh Chu Xian, founder and CEO of MagoriumA committed and experienced SME partnerIn further validation of DBS' commitment to partner the region's SMEs through thick and thin, Hong Kong-based The Asset has similarly named DBS as both the Asia-Pacific's and Singapore's Best Bank for SMEs.Tan Su Shan, group head of institutional banking at DBS, said: \"We do not take these accolades from Euromoney and The Asset lightly and are grateful for the trust that SMEs in the region have placed in us to deliver on their banking and digital transformation needs. We believe that when SMEs do well, the broader economy does well, and it is this greater sense of purpose that drives us to go the extra mile for our SMEs.

But how do you value the benefits and costs of Mother Nature'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> One example of the challenges in doing this is the Cross Island MRT Line, originally slated to pass through the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, home to an abundance of species.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After feedback from non-governmental organisations and conducting an environmental impact assessment, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) found that having the line going under the reserve, rather than passing directly through or skirting around it, was the most socio-economically and environmentally sensible option.</p><p> However, although scientific details of the impact of the MRT line's construction were well-researched and presented, one possible shortcoming is the rigour of economic valuation.</p><p> Economic valuation of biodiversity looks at what people are willing to trade off to conserve natural resources.</p><p> Attention is usually paid to the outcome of an environmental impact assessment - but that only reveals the physical impact of a proposed project on the environment. In our view, it is much more important for the process of valuation in the long run to ensure the consistency and quality of future assessments.</p><p> Here are some suggestions about considerations to note in putting a value on biodiversity and how to go about it.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SINGAPORE'S TRADE-OFFS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;We need to first understand and clearly delineate the functions and services of Singapore's ecosystems, as well as the various trade-offs involved.</p><p> Which biodiversity type to conserve and how much of it, against what are the forgone gains from employment, income, development, housing and even recreational pursuits from parklands are crucial to understanding these trade-offs.</p><p> Only by successfully decoupling and classifying these natural processes, as well as finding appropriate ways to reconcile scientific frameworks and findings with economics, should we then proceed with the valuation of biodiversity.</p><p> For a start, due to Singapore's unique circumstances, valuation of biodiversity attributes here may be quite different compared with other developed countries.</p><p> Since its early years of development, Singapore has faced stark trade-offs, such as economic expansion involving land reclamation versus preserving or restoring ecosystems, a costly process in itself.</p><p> To mitigate this trade-off, it is important to understand how biodiversity can coexist with green infrastructure in Singapore such as rooftop greenery, parks, gardens, wildlife corridors, canals and seawalls.</p><p> Factors to consider include the optimal size and connectivity of such infrastructure for biodiversity conservation, and how wildlife population sizes and species composition vary with the constraints and economic activities associated with the infrastructure.</p><p> There are also trade-offs between the different types of benefits that ecosystem services provide. For example, allocating resources away from improving recreation parks to investment in coral reef research and conservation programmes.</p><p> However, as our consumer goods and raw materials are largely imported, the trade-off involving the extraction of resources from Singapore's natural ecosystems at the expense of nature's own ways of regulating the environment may be less problematic.</p><p> A trade-off also exists between reducing environmental pollution and an increase in demand for ecosystem products. For example, solar panels require forest fragmentation to obtain minerals for construction. However, Singapore imports solar panel materials from abroad for local manufacture.</p><p> The question then is, whether we should confine our valuation of biodiversity to a local setting only, or include biodiversity elsewhere that may be indirectly affected because of our high import dependency.</p><p> In addition, it is possible that Singapore's progress in green finances, carbon markets, climate mitigation and adaptation technologies may reduce or offset our dependence on nature in other areas, such as for recreation.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SO HOW SHOULD WE VALUE BIODIVERSITY'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A common technique in cost-benefit analysis is to study individual choices in existing markets related to the ecosystem service to be valued.</p><p> For example, travel expenses can be taken as a proxy for the price that people pay to visit such ecosystems. The higher the travel cost, the lower might be the demand to go there. In this way, a demand curve can be derived for an ecosystem and its value estimated.</p><p> Another way is to attribute and isolate differences in property prices to individuals' preference for biodiversity elements within their neighbourhood. Properties near vibrant ecosystems might command a premium compared with those which are not.</p><p> It is plausible that Singaporeans value managed urban vegetation such as parks and gardens more highly - due to their direct recreational benefits - than unmanaged vegetation or urban wildlife.</p><p> For example, when wild boars, otters, hornbills and monkeys venture into residential areas, they cause disruption and often are unwelcome.</p><p> To capture the non-user intangible benefits associated with biodiversity, surveys can find out the willingness of individuals to pay for enhancement or simply accept their degradation.</p><p> The biodiversity values of vulnerable or critically endangered species in Singapore such as hawksbill turtles, Sunda pangolin and Raffles' banded langur could be more highly weighted so that conservation efforts are prioritised for these species.</p><p> Care should also be taken to ensure that the benefits of biodiversity accrued to both present and future generations are fairly distributed.</p><p> Due to the complex nature of biodiversity and ecosystems, valuation studies are at times fraught with uncertainty and challenges. It is difficult to quantify the links between species richness and ecosystem functions, and between the latter and the services they provide.</p><p> Typical valuation approaches estimate only the marginal changes in the quantity or quality of ecosystem services, without clearly acknowledging the ecosystem's threshold state where it will collapse if it continues to be overused.</p><p> There is also a risk of double counting benefits. This can result from overlap of ecosystem services, such as water purification and water supply, or recreation and culture. Demand for ecosystem services inferred from travel patterns and market prices may also overlap, especially for a dense urban biodiversity setting like Singapore.</p><p> People may be unfamiliar with valuing scientific aspects of biodiversity, such as species and functional composition, that vary across space and time compared with easily identifiable ecosystem goods such as wetlands and nature reserves.</p><p> There may also be differences between how people feel towards hypothetical and actual environmental changes. For example, they might be concerned about having to pay higher taxes to finance conservation projects.</p><p> The bottom line is that valuing biodiversity requires both ecologists and economists to work closely together and to refine existing valuation techniques to account for the complexities of biodiversity, adapted to the Singapore context.</p><p> Accounting for, and protecting against, biodiversity losses requires more than just an environmental impact assessment. A monetary valuation of the trade-offs required and the use of cost-benefit analysis are needed too so that informed decisions can be made.</p><p>\u00b7 Euston Quah is Albert Winsemius chair professor of economics and director of the Economic Growth Centre at Nanyang Technological University.

Infrastructure sectors in EMDEs raised more than US$500 billion in loans and bonds in 2021. That's from the financing side. In EMDEs, total investments in fossil fuel-based infrastructure (from oil and gas to conventional power generation) amounted to US$210 billion in 2021 and US$1.24 trillion since 2015. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These are based on open-source data in the marketplace, and do not include spending obscured by non-market fiscal subventions or subsidies towards fossil fuel sectors (which are substantial). Conversely, total investment in renewable energy sources amounted to US$45 billion in 2021 only, and US$235 billion since 2015. </p><p> Furthermore, there is also a prevailing stance in many EMDEs that the state-owned companies continue to invest and hold fossil fuel-related infrastructure as critical national assets, while renewables like solar or wind power development are carried out by the private sector through public--private partnerships (PPPs). The financing advantage the state typically enjoys is thus not fully channelled towards renewables. </p><p> Hence, on the one hand, many policymakers highlight the large financing gaps for net zero transition. On the other hand, we see the large financing capacity of EMDE firms (including many state-owned enterprises) and the channelling of investments into fossil fuel sectors. It is as much a financing gap as it is a financing trap. This paradox can only be understood in the context of insufficient reallocation of economic resources towards net zero.</p><p> The double externalitiesThere are two related issues with the same root cause. First, the continued lack of carbon price to drive reallocation of economic activities. Carbon pricing fixes several externalities at one go. It reduces waste of existing energy use by businesses and households and encourages them towards use of cleaner energy. Carbon pricing also creates pressures for the most pollutive firms in each industry to change or to exit, ceding market shares to the more productive ones. These important reallocation dynamics do not work well otherwise. </p><p> Second, and perhaps less articulated, is how the lack of carbon price hampers the innovation processes towards net zero. It is well known that firms underinvest in innovation because they often do not capture the full economic benefits of their innovation. Studies have confirmed that one innovation often leads to spillovers to benefit other innovators, in other geographies and sectors. </p><p> To put things in an even starker perspective, fossil fuel companies are not standing still, they too are innovating to produce at lower costs. One only has to recall that fracking technology in the past two decades has added large supplies of gas to the market. Today, the high energy prices mean that there are strong incentives, even if unspoken, to innovate and produce more. </p><p> To be fair, fossil fuel companies have also innovated in areas towards cleaner production of fossil fuels (eg reducing methane flaring and saving energy used in production). But this is at best an interim stage towards net zero. Better production of fossil fuels would still lead to climate damage. </p><p> Clearly, a lot of new technologies like battery and storage, green hydrogen, carbon capture would have to be technically and commercially viable to make a net zero economy possible. Innovations that that help solve the intermittency problem for renewables will also reduce policymakers' concerns around energy security. Incentives towards innovation and adoption of green technology need to be sharpened.</p><p> The unpriced nature of greenhouse emissions thus creates not one but a double negative reinforcing externalities -- one at the production and consumption end, and the other at the innovation end. Incentives towards net zero remain underpowered in EMDEs as a result.</p><p> Risk of losing competitivenessThere is another hidden long-term risk for EMDEs in falling behind in the net zero transition -- the loss of competitiveness and innovation capacity in important green sectors. Many advanced economies have implemented a carbon price or stringent regulations. This has compelled companies to innovate and adapt more quickly towards net zero. The majority of net zero related patents (eg renewables and waste management) are still filed by companies in major advanced economies, in terms of both volume and patent market value. The incentives and pressures are arguably less in EMDEs. </p><p> Yet within a few short decades, all production and international trade will have to be consistent with net zero. Green infrastructure and production will become the basis of international competitiveness. Falling behind in critical innovations and business processes would mean having to import these technologies or goods later, or risk begin priced or regulated out of the global marketplace. Hence, getting an early momentum in net zero transition is important to allow for the accumulation of knowledge and know how.</p><p> A road map for a low carbon economyImposing a carbon price with the backdrop of high inflation will not be easy. One might even argue that a high energy price arising from the war in Ukraine already acts like a carbon price. Except that it is not equivalent. While a high price will curtail fossil fuel demand, we must again realise that this reallocates resources into fossil fuel sectors -- opposite of what a carbon price seeks to achieve. It leaves windfall profits at the hands of fossil fuel companies rather than as taxes for the state. A high fossil fuel price is a poor substitute for an actual carbon price. </p><p> A carbon price can be implemented in stages. One way is to first impose a shadow carbon price on all state-owned companies, essentially requiring them to plan and invest as if a carbon price is already there. It can also start with large polluters first. There should be also a plan to exit select industries that no longer fit the context of a low carbon economy. </p><p> Imposing annual limits on banking or bond financing that can flow into fossil fuel sectors would bring about a shadow carbon price through finance, allowing constraints to kick in without hitting headline inflation at one go. Of course, over time, a transparent carbon price should be set for the price signal to guide the needed reallocation rather than ad hoc administrative policies. </p><p> Many EMDEs have in the past encouraged FDIs into key sectors to jumpstart economic development, participate in global value chains, and benefit from knowledge diffusion. This can be a key part of the strategy towards a low carbon economy. Again, starting early will avoid large capacity gaps from developing later and with it, the loss of competitiveness. EMDEs will need to act fast. </p><p> The writers are from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Policy-making has been top-down, with high-level directives guiding the overall development of the market. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In 2016, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China Banking and Insurance Commission and several ministries issued the Guidelines for Establishing the Green Financial System, which have served as the major policy framework for green finance initiatives in the country. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The multi-layer characteristics of China's green finance system is evident in the high-level guidelines. The system consists of green loans, green bonds, environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds, green insurance, green leasing, green trusts and carbon trading. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> According to China's definition, the green finance business focuses on 6 green industries, namely energy-saving and environmental protection; cleaner production; clean energy; eco-environment; green infrastructure upgrades; and green services.</p><p> Regulatory dynamicsFrom a supervisory standpoint, banks' green finance businesses have been included in the macro prudential assessment since May 2021. Twenty-four major banking institutions will be subject to the quarterly assessment, where the total and relative scale of green credit, as well as business growth, will be reflected in the quantitative indicators. </p><p> To encourage banks to lend green, the PBOC gave them several direct financial incentives. For example, the PBOC accepted green assets as eligible collateral for its relending facilities, providing low-cost funding to banks for green projects. Green loans are now accepted as part of the standing lending facilities, and green bonds with at least AA ratings are accepted as collateral in medium-term lending facilities.</p><p> The PBOC also provided lower cost funding support to projects either facilitating carbon emission reductions or the efficient and cleaner use of coal, through the carbon emission reduction tool or its 200 billion yuan (US$29.9 billion) re-lending facility. Going forward, there may be preferential risk weighting treatment given to green credit in banks' capital ratio calculation, similar to what the PBOC has done for inclusive loans for micro and small enterprises when it applied a 75 per cent risk weighting.</p><p> Growth potentialPresident Xi Jinping's recent pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 will likely be a significant boost to green finance's development. There will be immense financing demand during China's greener economic transformation. </p><p> UBS estimates that up to US$2 trillion in annual investment will be needed in 9 sectors directly linked to the net-zero target in the coming 40 years. Similarly, the National Development and Reform Commission estimated a total of 487 trillion yuan in financing will be needed in green areas during 2020-2050E.</p><p> Among all the green finance products, green loans and green bonds are the major forms of green financing, whose balance stood at 15.9 trillion yuan and 1.1 trillion yuan at the end of 2021, accounting for 8.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent of the system's total. In our base case, we expect the market for green loans and green bonds to reach 62 trillion yuan and 8 trillion yuan by 2031E, growing at a 10-year compound annual growth rate of 14.5 per cent and 22.2 per cent. </p><p> Green finance could be a major revenue driver for Chinese banks in the coming decade, generating a potential revenue pool of 1.4 trillion yuan and contributing to 15 per cent of the banking system's total by 2031E.</p><p> The profitability outlookIn our view, green lending is a profitable business, with potential 1.3 per cent return on assets and 16 per cent return on equity, which is higher than the general corporate banking business. The higher margin is mainly boosted by lower credit costs at present. </p><p> According to PBOC disclosures, the nonperforming loan ratio for green loans was 0.33 per cent at the end of 2020. However, lower loan yields and deteriorating asset quality may be downside risks for profit margins. The national service risk of lower loan pricing to shore up green industries may weigh on the net loan spread, particularly for the \"Big Four\" state-owned banks, China's major green lenders. </p><p> Currently, it is common practice for state-owned banks to offer cuts of 30 to 50 basis points (bps) off the interest rates of green loans, from our discussions with banks' senior management. </p><p> A potential downside risk is that regulators might continue to guide on banks to lower the loan pricing to support the green industries. </p><p> To assess the asset quality risk, we conducted a debt-at-risk analysis. Our results indicated that green bond issuers likely have higher debt repayment capabilities than general corporate bond issuers. </p><p> However, a list of narrowly defined green companies tended to have higher debt-at-risk ratio than A-share listed companies in general. </p><p> At present, almost half of the green loans went to finance green upgrades of infrastructure. These projects are very likely to be backed by the local government. Hence, default risk could be low. That said, credit costs might come up if government no longer provides extensive supports to green industries, such as ending subsidies.</p><p> Obstacles to developmentTo further grow the green finance business in China, we believe some obstacles may need to be addressed. To begin with, to gradually align China's definition for green industries and green finance with international standards will be a big step forward. </p><p> Currently, China's definitions of green loans and green bonds are markedly different from international benchmarks. For example, in the green loan area, China recognises much narrower categories of eligible green projects. </p><p> The Green Loan Principles (issued by the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and the Loan Market Association) adopt a non-exhaustive approach by explicitly recognising several broad categories of green projects with the objective of addressing key areas of environmental concern. </p><p> To prevent the risk of greenwashing, the PBOC only recognises green projects in 12 areas. A broader definition could further boost China's green finance development.</p><p> Next, expanding the scope of the carbon trading business by allowing financial institutions to participate in the market. Individual and institutional investors are currently prohibited from trading on the national carbon exchange, the China Carbon Emission Trade Exchange (CCETE). </p><p> On top of this, the CCETE allows for a much narrower scope of trading products than the EU Emissions Trading System, which launched carbon financial derivatives, such as carbon emission spot, forward, futures and option products in 2005. </p><p> These financial derivatives could reduce the volatility of carbon prices, and are thus conducive to the emission cost control of enterprises and enhanced market liquidity, in our view. </p><p> We believe financial institutions' participation in the carbon trading market could facilitate innovation in the carbon finance area and better satisfy companies' carbon financing demand.</p><p> Last but not the least, banks should incorporate more advanced risk modelling and management into their green finance businesses. </p><p> China's banking system does not have a clear responsibility mechanism for environmental accidents and liabilities. As a result, most banks are not conducting comprehensive environmental stress tests. </p><p> Even though the PBOC conducted the first round of climate risk stress tests in late 2021, the scope of testing was limited and only 23 large banks participated. There is still a long way to go to develop more advanced modelling, in our view.

Development of Tuas Port is over four phases. Reclamation works for Phase 1 commenced in February 2015 and were completed in November 2021. Reclamation works for Phase 2 commenced in March 2018 and is currently about 60% completed. When the berths in both phases are fully operational, Tuas Port will reach an annual handling capacity of more than 40 million TEUs.</p><p>3.

Phase 2 will provide port stakeholders with real-time information to facilitate just-in-time vessel arrivals to terminals, help vessels access marine services such as bunkering, supplies and repairs, as well as an Active Anchorage Management System to optimise the usage of anchorage spaces. This will enhance port efficiency, reduce ship turnaround time, and cut greenhouse gas emissions by minimising ships' idling time at anchorages.</p><p>Singapore Trade Data Exchange Pilot Data Sharing Initiative</p><p>12. MPA will work with Singapore Trade Data Exchange (SGTraDex), Jurong Port and their partners to pilot a data sharing initiative under SGTraDex's ship supplies and lighterage optimisation use case that focuses on supplies procurement, fulfilment and lighterage logistics. The pilot aims to help large and small businesses optimise their ship supplies operations by digitalising their ship supplies operations, and encouraging data sharing between supply chain stakeholders in the ship supplies sector.</p><p>Maritime Cyber Assurance and Operations Centre</p><p>13. As maritime systems become increasingly digitalised, Singapore must also be prepared with the right tools to manage the risk of cyber incidents that could disrupt the flow of vessels and cargo at our ports.</p><p>14. MPA will establish the Maritime Cyber Assurance and Operations Centre (MCAOC) by 2025 to provide real-time security monitoring and disseminate information to mitigate cyber threats, advise on system recovery and measures to take following an incident, and facilitate cyber threat information-sharing among maritime stakeholders such as port and terminal operators, shipping lines and marine service providers with digital systems.</p><p>15. The MCAOC will enable maritime stakeholders to pool financial and manpower resources, and create economies of scale, to tackle cyber threats in the maritime sector.</p><p>16. Equipped with analytics capability, MCAOC will strengthen operational responses to evolving cyber threats by providing insights to maritime stakeholders on advanced malware and modes of attack. MCAOC will also offer training and conduct cybersecurity exercises for the maritime industry.</p><p>(B) Reducing carbon emissions in Maritime Singapore</p><p>Decarbonising Domestic Harbour Craft and Pleasure Craft</p><p>17. MPA will set the target for the harbour craft and pleasure craft sectors to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 in support of Singapore's 2050 national net-zero target. To achieve this transition, from 2030, all new harbour craft operating in our port waters must be fully electric, be capable of using B100 biofuel, or be compatible with net-zero fuels such as hydrogen.</p><p>18. To help the industry meet the 2030 requirement, MPA encourages the industry to consult with MPA on the owners' electric, B100 or hydrogen compatible harbour craft designs early. The consultation process will be a compulsory requirement from 2027.</p><p>19. MPA will support the development of electrification technology through the following initiatives:</p><p>Disclaimer: Table can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mpa.gov.sg/media-centre/details/strenghtening-singapore-s-competitveness-as-a-hub-port-and-international-maritime-centre\">https://www.mpa.gov.sg/media-centre/details/strenghtening-singapore-s-competitveness-as-a-hub-port-and-international-maritime-centre</url></p><p>Pathways for Alternative Fuels</p><p>20. To prepare Singapore for a multi-fuel bunkering future, MPA has developed the world's first marine biofuel provisional standard in consultation with the industry and researchers for biofuel blends of up to 50% or B50. This standard will be updated progressively as trials for biofuel blends of up to 100%, or B100 are carried out, and is expected to be completed by 2025. Singapore's Maritime Energy and Sustainable Development Centre of Excellence will also be releasing the findings of its compatibility study on various biofuel types and percentage blends for our harbour crafts by end March 2023.</p><p>21. Aside from biofuels, MPA is exploring the use of hydrogen and ammonia to support the decarbonisation of international shipping. In December 2022, MPA and the Energy Market Authority launched an Expression of Interest (EOI) to build, own and operate low or zero-carbon ammonia power generation and bunkering solutions on Jurong Island. The EOI is open until end April 2023.</p><p>Green and Digital Shipping Corridors</p><p>22. In August 2022, MPA signed a MOU with the Port of Rotterdam to establish the world's longest \"Green and Digital Shipping Corridor (GDSC)\". The corridor will pilot the deployment of digital solutions, support investment in green infrastructure, and develop enablers to accelerate low and zero carbon shipping.</p><p>23. Singapore is actively engaging other like-minded ports and country partners to establish more corridors. Recently, MPA, Port of Los Angeles, Port of Long Beach and C40 Cities started discussions to establish a GDSC between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay port complex.</p><p>(C) Future-Ready Maritime Talent</p><p>24. MPA has put in place several schemes to attract and develop a steady pipeline of maritime talent, who are equipped with the right skills and expertise as the industry transforms.</p><p>Internships, scholarships, and pre-employment training for undergraduates</p><p>25. Global Internship Award: Established by MPA in 2013, the Global Internship Award aims to help undergraduates better understand the international nature of the maritime industry. The 12-week programme gives selected undergraduates an opportunity to gain on-the-job experience working in a leading maritime company. It sponsors the undergraduate for an overseas attachment of up to six weeks in the overseas office of the company. More than 300 undergraduates have benefitted from the programme in the last ten years.</p><p>26. Scholarships: In 2022, 54 MaritimeONE scholarships, worth about S$1.7 million in value, were awarded. Since the launch in 2007, 524 recipients have received the scholarships. Additionally, 12 Tripartite Maritime Scholarships (TMSS) valued at about S$1 million were awarded in 2022 to seafaring cadets. Since the launch in 2002, more than 240 TMSS have been given out.</p><p>27. Work-Study Programmes: There are currently three maritime-related Work-Study Post-Diploma Programmes targeted at fresh Polytechnic graduates conducted by Singapore Polytechnic (SP), and a Work-Study Diploma by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).

That is almost twice as much as the current output of all Danish offshore wind turbines.</p><p> Around 450 more turbines will be built, until a capacity of 10 gigawatts is reached - enough for 10 million households.</p><p>Denmark has only 2.8 million households, and a population of 5.8 million. This means the country will be an important supplier of electricity to Germany, its big industrial neighbour to the south.</p><p> Usually, such mega projects are expected from bigger countries such as China, and not from a small country.</p><p> \"It is important that Denmark leads the way,\" said Mr Jorgensen. \"Only if we inspire others and develop new green solutions that they will use, can we seriously do something about climate change.\"</p><p> The country aims to achieve an ambitious 70 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide by 2030, compared with 1990. This cannot be achieved without abandoning fossil fuels.</p><p> \"We'll manage on sun and wind alone,\" said Professor Jacob Ostergaard, founder and head of the Centre for Electric Power and Energy at the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen.</p><p> With 110 employees, he is researching smart solutions which do not unnecessarily store electricity in resource-guzzling and expensive batteries.</p><p> \"Right now, we need 4.6 gigawatts of electricity in the whole country on an average morning,\" said Prof Ostergaard. That is only a third more than what the energy island will supply in its first development stage.</p><p> \"In fact, we will multiply energy production and consumption in the future. The wind potential in the North Sea is huge,\" he said, adding that 180 gigawatts lie fallow there.</p><p> However, the turbines in the stormy sea could produce far too much electricity for the power grid.</p><p> Prof Ostergaard has the solution ready: Produce liquid fuel at sea whenever the turbines produce too much electricity. \"We will also need liquid fuel in the future for industry,\" he said.</p><p> The splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen using the process of electrolysis consumes a lot of electricity, he explained. The hydrogen can then be processed into aviation petrol and other fuels for climate-neutral aircraft and container ships.</p><p> That is why the energy island needs such a large area: There has to be space for a hydrogen factory.</p><p> However, engineers are also trying their hand at another revolutionary idea: producing hydrogen directly in or near the towers of the windmills, which will be piped to the energy island and then to the coast.</p><p> \"The main point is to create flexibility everywhere in the energy system,\" said Prof Ostergaard.</p><p> That means, for example, building new and better cable lines to other seaboard countries.</p><p> \"There is almost always wind in the North Sea. When it dies down off Denmark, there is a fresh breeze off the Netherlands, or vice versa,\" he said.</p><p> There has hardly been any opposition to the Danish mega-project, with all the main opposition parties in Parliament in favour of it.</p><p> Mr Sune Scheller from the Greenpeace environmental group is also positive about it. \"Of course, plans and construction must stand up to environmental impact assessments. But if we criticise anything, it's mainly that it's not happening fast enough,\" he said.</p><p> The bidding process is being prepared, and the tender is to be processed next year.</p><p> So far, two Danish-dominated consortia are vying for the contract. One is led by Orsted, the world leader in offshore wind power. Its competitor is Vindo, a consortium of pension funds, a utility company and green infrastructure investment company Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.</p><p> In early 2023, it will be announced who will co-finance, build and operate the island.

It also pledged to peak emissions around 2030, and halve them by 2050.</p><p> While the country is disadvantaged given its lack of natural renewable energy sources, green technologies have been improving rapidly and alternative low carbon solutions like carbon capture, utilisation and storage as well as hydrogen are starting to look more plausible.</p><p> \"We will therefore raise our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century,\" Wong said.</p><p> To achieve the new net-zero ambition, Singapore will raise the carbon tax in several steps, with a view to reaching S$50 to S$80 per tonne by 2030.</p><p> Businesses will be able to use carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions, while households will get support such as utilities rebates.</p><p> The coming decade would see a greening of traditional sectors of the economy such as aviation, energy and tourism, said Wong.</p><p> \"At the same time, emerging green sectors like green finance and carbon services will grow in prominence. Millions of new green jobs will be created around the world and demand for talent with green skills will increase.\"</p><p> Moving quickly, Singapore will be able to build on its competitive advantages and capture new opportunities.</p><p> \"We can become the go-to location in Asia for expertise in carbon services and the trusted regional marketplace for carbon credits. As a key node for international air and sea transport networks, we can become a frontrunner in the development of sustainable aviation and marine fuels,\" he said.</p><p> Green finance is one of the fastest growing segments in the financial services sector.

The infrastructure upgrades will be funded by green bonds. EV's market share was 4 per cent in 2021, compared to 0.2 per cent in 2020.</p><p>Singapore's new green target is widely lauded by the industry.</p><p> Sharad Somani, partner, head of infrastructure advisory, KPMG in Singapore, said the five-fold hike in carbon tax by 2030 is a \"brave move\", and \"lends further credibility to Singapore's goal of bringing forward the net-zero target to around mid-century\".</p><p> \"We should expect a lot more international collaborations as well as research and development investments on cutting edge technologies covering carbon capture, energy efficiency, alternate fuels and clean energy infrastructure,\" Somani said.</p><p> Irene Tai, partner, tax at PwC Singapore said the move reflects Singapore's seriousness about its commitment to the Paris Agreement and signals its intention to become a green economic hub, despite the challenging economic environment.</p><p> \"We look forward to seeing the carbon tax revenues reinvested to support companies' efforts to achieve their low carbon transition ambitions,\" Tai said.</p><p> Fang Eu-Lin, environmental, social and governance (ESG) leader at PwC Singapore, said the plans to issue up to S$35 billion in green bonds by 2030 will help to create jobs across the value chain, from sustainable finance, sustainable infrastructure and assets, ESG professionals, and further direct capital towards green projects to combat climate change.</p><p> \"It gives further certainty to the transitions that are going to have to take place, for example, infrastructure for EVs and phasing out of internal combustion engine vehicles,\" she said.</p><p> However, to be in the forefront of a green finance hub, it will require an ecosystem including green projects, demand from investors and the expertise, from designing the right jobs to skills to carry these ambitions, Fang said.</p><p> Abhi Bhuchar, head of Consumer and Industrials, Southeast Asia, and Energy, Asia Pacific, at Oliver Wyman, believes the progressive increase in carbon tax will increase Singapore's attractiveness as an investment hub.</p><p> \"The government has given certainty in an uncertain path to decarbonisation, which will certainly attract capital.

This is the Budget that will not only take Singapore out of the pandemic with confidence, but also one that we hope will set the country on course for the future in a world marked by constant fast-paced changes and uncertainties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We do expect that in this future, sustainability will underpin business and living, with Singapore potentially taking the lead regionally in green initiatives and financing to cut down on carbon emissions. Amid ongoing uncertainties on the global front, including how the new international tax rules will take shape, Singapore will also have to be at the forefront of these developments to seize new opportunities.</p><p> Emerging from the pandemic, Budget 2022 lays out the steps that Singapore should be taking in the medium to long term. Three priorities mentioned in the Budget speech are worth highlighting: (1) Driving an environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda for Singapore; (2) Strengthening Singapore's value proposition as a regional hub of choice for businesses; and (3) Upskilling our workforce and attracting talent for a digital-led world across industries.</p><p> These will be crucial for Singapore to catch the next economic sunrise and aligns with KPMG in Singapore's 3C framework for Budget 2022 where we outline how Singapore can \"Catch the Sun\", \"Chart New Orbits\", and \"Strengthen our Core\" to emerge as a resilient, purpose-driven and growth-oriented economy.</p><p>Driving the regional ESG agenda</p><p> In his Budget speech, Wong reaffirmed Singapore's commitment to the Singapore Green Plan and expressed his bold plans for Singapore to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century.</p><p> One of the measures that will have significant impact on businesses will be the hike in carbon tax. Singapore is set to raise its current carbon tax of S$5 per tonne to between S$50 and S$80 per tonne by 2030. Businesses would need to take major steps to decarbonise and tap the government support during this transition to ensure that their competitiveness will not be severely impacted from the increased carbon taxes.</p><p> Key to moving the green agenda as well would be green finance and green energy. This will be crucial in positioning Singapore as the go-to location in Asia for sustainability services. To develop a robust green market, Singapore will look at issuing up to S$35 billion in green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure projects. To further drive green innovation and tech adoption, a green energy investment fund could be mobilised to drive Singapore's and Asia's net zero ambitions.</p><p>Strengthening Singapore's value proposition as a hub of choice for businesses</p><p> Certainly, emerging from the pandemic, Singapore businesses will continue to need help to tackle immediate concerns. The government will set aside S$500 million for the Jobs and Business Support Package. This includes a Small Business Recovery Grant for small and medium-size enterprises that have been most affected by Covid-19 restrictions over the past year, such as those in the food and beverage, retail, tourism and hospitality sectors.</p><p> However, the country will also have to keep its sights on global developments as they unfold. While the net impact of the global tax rules remains to be seen, Singapore said it will be exploring a top-up tax called the Minimum Effective Tax Rate. This is to get the effective tax rate of affected multinational groups up to 15 per cent in Singapore.</p><p> Reassessing the balance between tax and non-tax measures will be crucial in attracting multinational companies to continue to locate their offices in Singapore, if not their headquarters (HQs).</p><p> At home, an area where we see the potential for transformation is in incentivising and anchoring \"factories of the future\" in Singapore. This is especially since more Singapore enterprises are adopting cutting-edge technologies to improve their manufacturing processes and produce high-value products.</p><p> As for non-tax incentives, Singapore will need to step up efforts to attract internationally trained and experienced human capital. A highly skilled workforce remains a critical value driver for Singapore into the future. Sector-specific talent will be needed for enterprise to grow and compete, and these should be considered as part of the national manpower strategy, with policies on specialised talent to meet immediate and long-term needs.</p><p>Attracting talent for a digital-led world across industries</p><p>Singapore is in a much better position today than it was two years ago, when the pandemic hit the economy and led to its worst decline since independence. With Budget 2022 charting an even stronger future for Singapore, enterprises will have to hire the best talent, even as the country continues to invest in Singaporeans.</p><p> It is important to note that the Minister for Finance has emphasised in his speech that Singapore will continue to stay open and welcome talent from around the world.</p><p> About S$600 million will be set aside to expand the range of available solutions under the Productivity Solutions Grant, while larger local businesses will be supported by a new initiative called the Singapore Global Enterprises, which will provide bespoke assistance tailored to the needs of promising local enterprises.</p><p> As companies large and small adopt a more permanent hybrid work model, they will need to continue to digitalise their operations across critical areas, while grooming a new generation of talent in a technology-led future. The gaps in the workforce and society will have to be bridged, with Singapore providing accessible sources of \"digital knowledge\" for all ages, as it grows an adaptable, innovative, and resilient workforce.</p><p> The government has announced an additional S$200 million to build the digital capabilities of businesses and workers. This will go a long way in empowering firms to be bold as they embrace the digital economy and aim for the international market.</p><p> The outlook for enterprises shines bright, with optimism back in the boardroom. About 9 in 10 Singapore CEOs are bullish about the growth potential in Singapore and on their companies' earnings over the next three years, according to KPMG's 2021 CEO Outlook Survey. It will be a pivotal year as many transform their business, engagement and sustainability strategies, and Budget 2022 has laid the foundation for this new economic horizon.</p><p>The writer is managing partner, KPMG in Singapore</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Key to moving the green agenda as well would be green finance and green energy.

Some of this has to be recouped.</p><p>Singapore's Net Investment Returns Contribution brings in the equivalent of some 3 per cent of gross domestic product to government coffers. Taxes fund Singapore's recurrent expenditures. In future, funding of infrastructure projects is likely to be done via borrowings, ostensibly by issuing bonds.</p><p> Beyond shoring up public finances, the tax system has to also take into consideration emerging challenges like rising inequality, an ageing society and climate change. It also has to ensure Singapore's competitive advantage remains intact.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;GST&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;It is a given that the goods and services tax (GST) will be raised.</p><p> The question is over whether it will be a full 2 per cent at one go, and the timing of its implementation.</p><p> Both from a business planning and tax administration perspective, it might be simpler if it is introduced in one shebang.</p><p> But GST can be a regressive tax. While the burden of a tax on final consumption will hit the entire population, young and old, its impact on the low-income segment of the population will be relatively heavier.</p><p> No doubt it will also capture income from overseas visitors when they start returning and spending in Singapore.</p><p> The government is committed to addressing the unequal impact via GST rebates and vouchers, which could soften the blow on lower-income Singaporeans for the rest of this decade.</p><p> Still, some ask whether this is the right time to institute a 9 per cent GST? We are currently experiencing high inflation. Could a GST hike be delayed two or three years down the road when economic growth is more robust or inflation subsides'</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;WEALTH TAX&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Another potential tool in the tax toolbox to tackle revenue need and inequality is wealth tax and estate duty.</p><p> What form these could take remains to be seen.</p><p> Some form of wealth taxes already exists now in the form of property tax, stamp duties, additional registration fees on vehicles and such. In financial year 2020/21, some 14 per cent of total tax revenue came from stamp duty and property tax.</p><p>Singapore abolished estate duty in 2008 because it impacted the middle-and upper middle-income disproportionately.</p><p> The problem with crafting wealth tax lies in the fact that wealth is often mobile. So are the talent who own the wealth.</p><p> Wealth in the form of art, jewellery, antiques and cash can be easily moved to different locations around the world.</p><p> It is this mobility that has enabled Singapore to become a major wealth management hub. Political stability and policy consistency have also played a big role in making Singapore a pan-Asian financial powerhouse.</p><p> Meanwhile, places like Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Malaysia encourage investors to hold assets there and promote themselves as attractive trust and asset management locations.</p><p> That said, countries around the world are getting together to cooperate in tax enforcement to address base erosion and profit shifting.</p><p> Much of the wealth in Singapore, and Asia, is tied to property. So could such taxes target gains on high-end fixed assets? Should new taxes related to property be tiered, so that the tax falls on larger properties and bigger transactions'</p><p> Also, should there be an inheritance tax for wealth transfers exceeding a certain amount, say over $10 million? In developed economies, such tax can be as high as 40 per cent. But wealthy families can use trust structures and private investment vehicles, as well as family offices, to circumvent such taxes.</p><p> The rich have the benefit of private banks and trust advisers to structure wealth such that such taxes are minimised or avoided.</p><p> So how should one craft this tax to be \"progressive\", but without damaging Singapore's wealth management status or hitting the middle class'</p><p> Also, while wealth taxes may send a nice signal, they may not really move the needle on the tax revenue front. Many big asset transactions need to take place to make a substantial dent on the tax revenue stream.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;CARBON TAX&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Climate change is real and small island nations like Singapore will bear the brunt of rising sea levels as global warming intensifies.</p><p> Any tax which provides disincentives for use of fossil fuels and carbon effluence and encourages sustainable green practices must be welcomed.</p><p> Here again, the question of fairness and equity arises.</p><p> The issue is how heavy a carbon tax can be imposed in an economy where access to \"green\" alternatives is somewhat limited at the moment. Singapore does not yet have the infrastructure to produce enough renewable energy.</p><p> It will take time and significant capital expenditure before the economy gets to a position where there is sufficient green infrastructure and access to a sizeable pool of renewable energy.</p><p> The fact that Singapore has a huge petrochemical industry must also factor into any carbon tax consideration.</p><p> Whatever the taxes that may be announced on Friday must be driven by considerations such as maintaining Singapore's competitive position while enhancing its reputation for financial prudence.</p><p> Will higher taxes reduce Singapore's competitiveness in comparison with places like Hong Kong and Switzerland which are the Republic's rivals for global financial hub status'</p><p> While raising taxes may be an immediate imperative of the Government, should there also be more tax incentive schemes to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, especially in areas where Singapore lags behind other developed and developing nations'</p><p> Fairness and sustainability will be key objectives.</p><p> Will the new tax regime reduce the gap between the rich and the poor'</p><p> If taxes on the rich are punitive, will Singapore still be able to attract entrepreneurs and global investors to live and work here, creating jobs and opportunities to contribute to a more vibrant economy in Singapore'</p><p> There is a fine balance to be achieved in increasing tax revenues, reducing social inequality and maintaining social harmony, while also sustaining Singapore's competitiveness and expanding its appeal as a global destination for investors and entrepreneurs.</p><p> Finding the right mix for Singapore's tax regime is no easy matter even for the most hardened economists and policymakers.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The issue is how heavy a carbon tax can be imposed in an economy where access to \"green\" alternatives is somewhat limited at the moment.

The Singapore Government commits to annual post-issuance allocation reporting and impact reporting on environmental benefits and, where possible, social co-benefits of the Eligible Green Expenditures. This provides transparency and accountability for investors and other interested parties.</p><p>c) Technical screening to evaluate and identify green projects: The eligibility criteria for the Green Categories have been developed with reference to internationally recognised market principles and standards such as the ICMA Green Bond Principles and the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI) Taxonomy and Sector Criteria.</p><p>3. Proceeds from green bonds issued under the Framework will be used to finance expenditures in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. This facilitates the transition to a low-carbon economy in Singapore, and advances the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The following are the categories of Eligible Green Expenditures:</p><p>a) Renewable Energy</p><p>b) Energy Efficiency</p><p>c) Green Building</p><p>d) Clean Transportation</p><p>e) Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management</p><p>f) Pollution Prevention, Control and Circular Economy</p><p>g) Climate Change Adaptation</p><p>h) Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Land Use</p><p>4. MorningstarSustainalytics, an independent ESG research firm, has completed an external review (Second-Party Opinion) on the green credentials of the Framework, and is of the view that the Framework is credible, impactful and aligns with internationally recognised market principles and standards.</p><p>5. Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah said at the Singapore Sustainable Investing and Financing Conference 2022, \"We are committed as one Government to taking bold and decisive actions to tackle climate change, finance sustainable infrastructure, and catalyse the green economy.

Good Afternoon. I am pleased to open the inaugural Singapore-International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (pronounced as \"EYE-REE-NAH\") High-Level Forum, held in conjunction with the 14th Singapore International Energy Week. I would also like to offer my appreciation to all Ministers, representatives of international organisations and industry leaders who have accepted our invitation to be part of this inaugural Forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. The theme for this Forum is \"Investing in an Inclusive and Just Clean Energy Transition\". This comes at a timely moment for the region and the world. The rise in gas, coal and electricity prices in recent months have brought to the fore various challenges in navigating the energy transition. Today's Forum presents a good opportunity for policymakers and industry leaders to come together to discuss how we can channel investments towards a timely energy transition.</p><p>3. There is an urgent need to mobilise investments to boost the energy transition. The IRENA's 2021 World Energy Transitions Outlook (WETO) highlights that the world will need more than a two-fold increase in energy sector investments to support the global energy transition - from USD 1.8 trillion in 2019 to USD 4.4 trillion per year by 2050. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), investments in clean energy must triple by 2030 if we hope to effectively combat climate change. In addition, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that Southeast Asia alone would require US$3.1 trillion of green infrastructure investments by 2030.</p><p>4. Singapore is doing our part to invest in the energy transition.</p><p>a. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s Green Finance Action Plan supports efforts to scale up finance to meet Asia's low-carbon transition needs. Initiatives include schemes to support the mainstreaming of green and sustainable financing, the establishment of green finance centres of excellence, and \"Project Greenprint\" to harness technology and data to support the green finance ecosystem.</p><p>b. We are also working towards the development of carbon market initiatives in Singapore. One such initiative is Climate Impact X - a joint initiative by Temasek, DBS, SGX, and Standard Chartered Bank.</p><p>c. The Singapore Government has set aside S$55 million (equivalent to about US$40 million) for the Low-Carbon Energy Research (LCER) Funding Initiative (FI). This initiative supports Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&amp;D) projects in low-carbon energy technologies such as hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) through 2025 to reduce Singapore's carbon emissions.</p><p>5. While countries seek to accelerate the energy transition, we need to ensure that this transition is inclusive and just. This means we do not lose sight of creating good jobs for our people and equipping them to seize these opportunities, especially in the clean energy sector.</p><p>6. For Singapore, we currently rely on natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel, for 95% of our power generation. Given our limited access to renewable energy, natural gas will continue to be an important energy source in the energy transition for Singapore, until alternative low-carbon generation technologies are commercially feasible.</p><p>7. Today, many of our workers in the energy sector have backgrounds in electrical and power engineering, and possess technical skillsets which are transferable from traditional power generation to renewable energy or low-carbon technology projects. This positions our workers well to take on new challenges in these sectors, as part of an inclusive energy transition where no worker is left behind. We will also continue to equip our workforce with the necessary skills to access good job opportunities through various manpower development initiatives. In particular, the industry-led centralised training institute for energy professionals, the Singapore Institute of Power and Gas, or SIPG, offers relevant courses to help workers upskill and reskill to meet the evolving demands of the sector.</p><p>8. Finally, it is crucial that we continue to harness technology as a key enabler in accelerating the clean energy transition. Technology advancements open up new possibilities, especially in terms of renewable energy potential.</p><p>9. In Singapore, recent developments in geothermal technology, such as advanced geothermal systems (AGS) which harness heat from deep dry rock, may allow Singapore to harness geothermal energy at greater depths, with minimal impact to environment and safety. With support from the National Research Foundation of Singapore, the Energy Market Authority of Singapore is working closely with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and various agencies to study and determine the geothermal resource potential in Singapore. NTU and the agencies aim to establish preliminary findings by end-2022. If deemed viable, Singapore could potentially adopt geothermal energy and further lower our power sector's carbon emissions.</p><p>10. Advancements in technologies, coupled with the declining costs, have enabled policymakers and industry leaders to significantly advance the role of renewables in the global energy systems. According to the IRENA, in the past year alone, 260 gigawatts (GW) of renewables-based generation capacity had been added globally - four times more than the capacity added from other fossil fuel-based sources. Singapore is keen to accelerate the development and deployment of emerging low-carbon alternatives, such as hydrogen and CCUS to support the energy transition. I look forward to gathering more insights on these issues from participants at today's Forum.</p><p>11. Director-General La Camera, Deputy Director-General Singh, Honourable Ministers and Excellencies, today's Forum is a step in the right direction towards \"An Inclusive and Just Clean Energy Transition\". In particular, we are appreciative of IRENA's strong support in ASEAN's energy transition and many capacity building initiatives under the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation or APAEC. Over the last few years, ASEAN and IRENA have deepened energy cooperation significantly since the signing of the ASEAN-IRENA Memorandum of Understanding in 2018 in Singapore.</p><p>12. Building on the success of this inaugural Singapore-IRENA High-Level Forum, I am pleased to note that both Singapore and IRENA will work towards (i) hosting the second edition of the Singapore-IRENA High-Level Forum at SIEW next year, and (ii) convening a special edition of the IRENA Investment Forum in Singapore, likely in 2023. Through these platforms, we aim to foster more robust high-level discussions towards strengthening access to renewable energy finance and low-carbon solutions across Asia.</p><p>13. I am confident that today's Forum will provide excellent thought leadership on the clean energy transition, and also contribute to the upcoming COP26 Conference in Glasgow. With that, may I now invite Director-General La Camera to give his opening remarks.</p><p>14.

But all markets will require unprecedented investment in decarbonisation technology.\"</p><p>To that end, Temasek announced on June 6 the launch of GenZero, a wholly-owned company dedicated to decarbonisation investments. Temasek also committed an initial amount of $5 billion into the subsidiary.</p><p>GenZero will invest globally across three focus areas: technology-based solutions, nature-based solutions and carbon ecosystem enablers.</p><p>The new company will be led by Frederick Teo, who is currently the managing director of sustainable solutions at Temasek International.

Recognising the importance of immediate action, we will focus on investment opportunities that can deliver positive climate impact by 2030,\" he says.</p><p>Speaking at a media conference on June 6, Teo set out his team's aim to balance \"climate impact with long-term sustainable financial returns\". \"In terms of financial returns, we definitely want to exceed our cost of capital, and then try and strike a good double bottom line.\"</p><p>A '45-minute city'</p><p>Indeed, companies can no longer solely focus on short-term returns, as shareholders, executives and even employees will demand more sustainable practices. Companies that refuse to adapt will lose out in the long term, says Teo Chee Hean, senior minister and Singapore's coordinating minister for national security.</p><p>\"First-movers will capture upsides while laggards may be written off as doing too little too late  Questions will be asked about your company's strategies to avoid stranded assets. Some legacy lines of production may be rendered obsolete,\" Teo said in his opening address at Temasek's Ecosperity Week 2022 on June 7.</p><p>At home, Singapore aims to phase out all internal combustion engines (ICE) by 2040. But this is just a part of achieving sustainable urban transportation, said Teo. \"It's not just about replacing all internal combustion engine [ICE] vehicles with electric vehicles. If we do that, we will convert our traffic jams with ICE vehicles today to traffic jams with electric vehicles.\"</p><p>Instead, the more fundamental solution is to minimise the need for cars, said Teo, with a \"comprehensive public transport system\". \"Since 2018, [we have] implemented a zero-growth policy for [our] vehicle population. We aim to be a 45-minute city in 2040, where nine out of 10 trips between homes and workplaces will take less than 45 minutes on our public transport network, even during peak hours.\"</p><p>The \"45-minute city\" was mooted in 2019 as part of the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 by the Land Transport Authority. \"Today, we are already two-thirds there,\" said Teo.</p><p>Surbana Jurong announced last week that its upcoming global headquarters will house Southeast Asia's largest electric vehicle (EV) charging hub.

It pared some gains on Thursday and is up 8 per cent since the start of the year.</p><p>The post Covid-19 recovery of China has been extremely bullish for the metal. China accounts for more than 50 per cent of global copper concentrate treatment and refining.</p><p>One sign of tightening copper concentrate supply, said S&amp;P Global Platts senior editor of non-ferrous metals Han Lu, is that the treatment charges (TC) paid by miners to smelters for converting copper concentrate to copper cathode, the raw material to make wires and cables, have fallen by half from pre-pandemic. (TC is the amount to be deducted from the total price of a cargo of copper concentrates, and is designed to cover refining costs. A lower TC generally implies tighter supply of copper concentrates).</p><p>The upbeat narrative for copper is also being led by the prospects of green infrastructure stimulus, although Ryan McKay, a commodity strategist at TD Securities, said green spending is unlikely to materially impact the red metal in the near-term.</p><p>The regulatory support for electric vehicles (EVs) have also boosted demand. More EVs mean the need for more charging stations, and those require lots of copper cables.</p><p>Notably, iron ore and steel have rebounded as well, even though these two metals are hardly related to green technologies. This suggests that the sentiment component should not be underestimated in explaining the recent rally, said Julius Baer next generation research head Carsten Menke.</p><p>The supply squeeze in copper is nothing to sniff at. Mr Gore said overall mine production disruptions in 2020 is estimated at 7 per cent, the highest since 2008.</p><p>More recently, high swells in Chile - the world's largest copper producer - caused some northern ports to be closed for 21 days in January, resulting in shipment delays to buyers. A resurgence of Covid-19 cases disrupted logistics in the world's second largest copper producer Peru. This is on top of Australian concentrate exports to China having dwindled to historically low levels.</p><p>Also, there have been very few significant copper deposit discoveries in the past decade.</p><p>ING head of commodities strategy Warren Patterson said the price environment for copper in the last two years or so was likely a bit low to attract the necessary investment to meet future copper demand. However, he expects current price levels to woo investment on the supply side \"assuming prices manage to hold onto these gains\".</p><p>Just this week, Citi Research upgraded its zero to three month copper point price to US$9,000 per tonne and six to 12 month point price to US$10,000 per tonne on the premise of a \"deep deficit\" this year and low inventories \"for years to come\".</p><p>It added that the strong decarbonisation-led demand for copper thus makes the prospects for a \"super cycle\" in the industrial metal \"real\".</p><p>Mr Menke, however, disagrees with the notion of another commodity \"super cycle\". He reckoned that the copper rally, like that of other industrial metals and oil, is driven by the turning economic cycle amid a recovery from the coronavirus crisis. In this regard, he said China's economy has already reached pre-crisis levels.</p><p>\"As China is set to continue its transition from investment-driven to consumption-driven growth, we believe that demand dynamics in the metals markets should soften, both in the short term and the longer term,\" he said, adding that this could offset the positive impact on copper from the emergence of clean technologies.</p><p>\"We thus do not see a big longer-term demand boost for industrial metals.

The more kids are exposed to gardens or the growing of vegetables, the more they will want to protect nature.</p><p> \u00b7 Where possible, use fans instead of air-conditioning and keep the temperature no colder than 25 deg C.</p><p> \"Sometimes, people don't start because they think they must do something big. We want to say it's about that movement. A vegetarian meal once a week or once a month is a movement. It's more sustainable in the long run,\" she said.</p><p>    &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SUSTAINABILITY CONCEPTS AND LIFELONG HABITS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;In Tampines Secondary, environmental sustainability concepts are woven into the school curriculum.</p><p> For instance, in Secondary 1 science lessons, students learn about what Singapore is doing in the area of renewable energy and how solar energy is harnessed.</p><p> In food and consumer education, teachers talk about food waste in Singapore, and get students to think about how much food is thrown away and the carbon footprint it involves.</p><p> Chemistry students learn about the harmful gases that are released into the environment as a result of human activities.</p><p> As part of CCE, Secondary 3 students delve into the topic of e-waste by discussing how the incineration of e-waste is toxic to humans. This is followed by an e-waste drive in which the items collected can be upcycled or disposed of correctly.</p><p> Mrs Preeti Bhart Sheri, head of CCE at Tampines Secondary, said she hopes that the concepts reinforced over four years will help achieve a shift in mindset for these teenagers, who can then influence their family or neighbours.</p><p> Apart from the structured curriculum, students sort out the trash in their classrooms every day. Two green ambassadors in each class are in charge of ensuring the items that can be recycled are disposed of in the correct container and later brought to a common recycling bin.</p><p> Mrs Sheri, who teaches geography and social studies, said she hopes these daily practices will help youth form lifelong habits.</p><p> \"I'm very heartened when I see them taking pride in separating their trash. All these habits will amount to something because it is not one-off - it is a routine.\"</p><p> She makes it a point to remind her students that individual efforts contribute to a cleaner, greener world.</p><p> \"It is easy for us to think we are a small country or one individual, but we want them to learn that their individual eco-friendly habits do make a difference. Culture-building takes time,\" said Mrs Sheri.</p><p> The school also has an environment-related co-curricular activity, Maker Faire, in which students upcycle discarded materials into usable products such as a foosball table or standing lamps.</p><p> \"When they experiment with things, it gives them knowledge and skills to put into practice for an environmentally sustainable society. This may make them more passionate about future green jobs,\" said Mrs Sheri.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;MAKING ENVIRONMENT EDUCATION COME ALIVE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Environment education starts the moment a child enters Primary 1 in Mee Toh School.</p><p> Pupils at every level are involved in the weekly recycling programme, in which they take their recyclables from home every Wednesday.</p><p> Two environment ambassadors from each class then sort the recyclables into different categories such as plastic, paper or aluminium drink cans at the recycling station in the school foyer.</p><p> As part of the school's applied learning programme in environmental education, Primary 2 pupils learn about biodiversity and to appreciate nature and the environment by making posters and doing presentations.</p><p> Through a farm-to-table programme in Primary 3, they learn about food security and learn firsthand about the hard work that goes into growing food.</p><p> They plant vegetables hydroponically and grow mushrooms, with half the harvest sold in the canteen and the other half donated to an old folks' home.</p><p> Not only does this programme integrate subjects such as science, mathematics and social studies, but pupils who experience the process of growing their own food also become better advocates for less food wastage, said Miss Eleanor Quek, 35, the school's environment education adviser.</p><p> \"We saw students appreciating food better because they eat what they grow in the canteen,\" said Miss Quek, who is also subject head for total curriculum.</p><p> The school aims to walk the talk. So, as teachers teach Primary 4 pupils about water conservation, pupils see it come to life, as the school has its own rainwater collection tank where rainwater is collected and used to wash the school grounds.</p><p> Primary 6 pupil Dawn Tan, 12, said she has become more aware of environmental issues.</p><p> Dawn is head of her school's \"environment champions\" - a group of about 50 student leaders from Primary 4 to Primary 6 who lead projects for environmental causes.</p><p> \"We do projects like creating posters or decals, we encourage our peers to be more environmentally conscious or we make announcements to share facts about the environment,\" she said.</p><p> At home, Dawn's family has a recycling corner where items are sorted by material.</p><p> She said her mother had exposed her to simple recycling projects and that she has now learnt more from school to share with her mother.</p><p> \"Once, I saw her about to throw away a plastic bottle and reminded her to reuse it two to three times before recycling, and not just throw it away,\" she said.</p><p> She is happy that her school is doing its part for the environment.</p><p> \"I think it's a good thing we are training more people to be more environmentally friendly, and they will train more people. I hope that global warming will slow down through all these efforts,\" she said.</p><p>    It is easy for us to think we are a small country or one individual, but we want them to learn that their individual eco-friendly habits do make a difference.

As we work hard to overcome the pandemic, we cannot afford to lose sight of the much greater threat to our economic, developmental and societal gains as we know them: climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Covid-19 has undermined the foundation for many companies and industries. It has turned our daily lives upside down.

Clearer skies, disappearing smog and thriving ecosystems have given us a glimpse of how the environment may come to life when consumptions are balanced and emissions reduced. In a sense, we are rolling out the largest pollution experiment right now - and it is working.</p><p>Covid-19 has been kind to the environment. As we seek to recover and rebuild, this is an opportunity to use public investments to address the potentially much more devastating effects of climate change. Now is a chance to build back better and greener.</p><p>The second gain lies in the power of unity. The pandemic has taught us that national solutions will not solve global challenges. It has reminded us of the importance of international collaboration in combating global risks. In many ways, it gives us a clearer vision of what it will take to save the planet. Multilateralism is essential. Covid-19 has shown us that people are ready to fundamentally change their behaviour if they see that the threat is imminent and serious enough.</p><p>ISLANDS OF OPPORTUNITIES</p><p>While the pandemic's economic aftermath will undoubtedly squeeze public budgets as well as lead to higher national debts and competing priorities, it has provided us with even greater opportunities to act.</p><p>Just before the circuit breaker, Denmark's Minister for the Environment Lea Wermelin visited Singapore to conclude a five-year commitment on green, environmental collaboration with her counterpart, the then-Minister for Environment and Water Resources, Masagos Zulkifli.

None of our commitment will change despite the setback of Covid-19.</p><p>Singapore, as a hub with the capabilities, the experience and the talents to push for green recovery, is a key actor in Asia's efforts to build back better and greener - as is Denmark in Europe. But being small economies accounting for only 0.1 per cent of the world's emissions, neither of us can push the needle alone. Instead, we can ensure that green recovery is a race to the top and a guiding principle out of the crisis by taking leadership and utilising our innovation abilities to seek green opportunities.</p><p>A couple of months back, Denmark reinforced its green ambitions in a new climate package. This included committing S$60 billion to build two energy islands in our biggest single infrastructure investment.</p><p>The offshore wind project has the potential to expand to 12 gigawatts (GW) over time, which is more than double Europe's current offshore wind capacity alone. Also known as power-to-X, the technology could lead to a breakthrough in decarbonisation by allowing us to store and convert renewable energy into green electro-fuels for heavy-duty vehicles, shipping and aviation.</p><p>It might be a moonshot, but so was wind energy when we identified it as a key renewable source more than 40 years ago.</p><p>These energy islands present an opportunity to test out designs and technologies that have long been studied, but never built in real life - and so does the Singaporean-Danish green cooperation.</p><p>We seek to take on green innovations through strong public-private partnerships with academia, startups, inventors and environmental enthusiasts, not because it is the easiest injection to immediately boost our economies, but because it is the only right remedy for lasting progress and sustainable growth.</p><p>LEADERSHIP COMES FIRST</p><p>As with most other challenges throughout history, leadership comes before technical hurdles.</p><p>In this run-up to Singapore International Energy Week, I am greatly optimistic that this partnership, which blends Singapore and Denmark's strong government support to spur innovation for greater good, will inspire others to lead cohesive change.</p><p>As energy professionals, government representatives, policymakers and business leaders from all over the world gather in Singapore for this event, one thing stands clear: no country survives in a dying world.

The country's zero-Covid policy has been a social and economic experiment without precedent: a vast public health campaign that mostly kept the disease at bay; Xi Jinping's pride and joy; and, by the end, a waking nightmare for many of China's 1.4 billion people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Armies in white hazmat suits have been deployed to collect tens of billions of throat and nasal swabs. Millions were quarantined or hauled off to fever camps, often arbitrarily. Fear of isolation sent people fleeing from offices and factories where cases were found. Amateur videos captured residents leaping to their deaths from apartment blocks after weeks of seclusion. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In major cities, daily life stood still for months on end. A cosmopolitan class of young, wealthy Chinese was forced to come to grips with a life without international travel. Foreign entrepreneurs and executives were barred from returning to their homes and businesses in the country.</p><p> Before vaccines were available, officials could argue this approach was needed to save lives. By the end, the experiment offered a bleak existence at an extraordinary cost. </p><p> China's gross domestic product (GDP) probably grew by less than 3 per cent in 2022, well below the official target of around 5.5 per cent -- a shortfall of about half a trillion US dollars. Tough restrictions on movement snarled the world's most advanced supply chains. In November, profits generated by industrial firms fell by 9 per cent year on year. </p><p> Meanwhile, exchanges between China and the outside world fell to their lowest in decades. Few foreign students remain in the country. Overseas tourism has collapsed. Xi himself has only recently resumed foreign travel after remaining in China for two-and-a-half years.</p><p> Persistence is historyZero-Covid lasted longer than anyone initially expected, then collapsed faster than anyone could have imagined. In a matter of weeks, China has gone from having some of the world's strictest restrictions to almost none. </p><p> For the population at large, fear of lockdowns and quarantine has vanished. After a period of turbulence, economic activity is likely to rebound sharply. Increased demand for energy and commodities will be felt around the world. Investors and multinational executives can hope to visit colleagues and factories, after a painfully long pause. The great reconnecting of China with the outside world marks the end of an era: that of the global pandemic.</p><p> Normality will not arrive immediately. By one estimate, 37 million people a day are now catching Covid in China. Hospitals are overwhelmed. So are crematoriums. </p><p> Officials acknowledge few deaths -- and face an immense challenge keeping production lines running. Tesla, an American carmaker, halted operations at its factory in Shanghai on Christmas Eve. Local officials may seal off towns to keep cases down, worries one executive. The economy could contract in the first three months of opening up, says Tommy Wu of Commerzbank. </p><p> But the recovery will also arrive earlier than analysts had expected. Many think that the period of extreme volatility will draw to a close by the end of March. At that point, a recovery will begin that should gain strength as the year progresses.</p><p> Li Pengfei, until recently a product manager at an industrial software firm in Beijing, is among those desperate for things to get back to normal. Li lost his job last February when restrictions made basic duties, such as travelling to meet clients, near impossible. He spent part of last year living with his sister, but was forced to return home to Jilin province in China's far north-east, where economic prospects were dismal even before the pandemic. \"Things seem so volatile that even the big companies are downsizing,\" he says.</p><p> Elsewhere in the world bosses worry about a \"great resignation\", with workers quitting jobs or dropping out of the labour force altogether. It is less of a concern in China. Unlike in America, the government did not hand out stimulus cheques willy-nilly during the pandemic. People who lost their jobs, such as Li, will return to work quickly when the opportunity arises, economists believe, helping to steady factory output.</p><p> Consumption will rise, too. Incomes have fallen, but zero-Covid also squashed spending, as people avoided travelling and eating out. All told, households saved one-third of their income last year. This year many will be getting back on their feet after job losses, stagnating pay and declines in the value of their homes, meaning the splurge will be limited. </p><p> But Jacqueline Rong of BNP Paribas, a bank, reckons household consumption will grow by about 9 per cent in 2023 -- a big improvement on the previous year's growth rate, if not full retribution for the enforced abstemiousness of recent years.</p><p> Reopening will also benefit China's troubled property sector, though quite how much depends on political decisions. In November, as Covid restrictions were relaxed, policymakers eased property developers' access to financing. That should help stronger firms avoid default and finish building flats they have already sold to homebuyers. At China's Central Economic Work Conference in December, policymakers promised to support \"fundamental demand\", as opposed to speculative purchases. To that end, they may make further cuts to mortgage rates and down-payment requirements.</p><p> There is a wide range of forecasts for the performance of the property sector, broadly defined to include construction, services and furnishings. Activity could grow by 3 per cent this year, says Jing Liu of HSBC, another bank -- enough to add 0.9 percentage point to China's GDP growth rate. </p><p> A more optimistic scenario has it expanding by 5 per cent, she thinks, adding 1.5 points to growth. Some households might decide that now is a good time to \"buy the dip\", before prices revive, or regulatory restrictions on home purchases return.</p><p> Beyond the borderThe economic implications of reopening extend farther afield. Zero-Covid kept a lid on China's demand for global goods, services and commodities. During the lockdown of Shanghai in the first half of last year, for instance, the country's oil demand fell by two million barrels per day. </p><p> In the past, such drops in Chinese spending would have deprived the world economy of a crucial engine of growth. The Covid downturn has been different. It coincided with an overheated economy in America and an interrupted supply of energy across Europe. \"At least this time China isn't contributing to inflation,\" says Louis Kuijs of S&amp;P Global, a rating agency.</p><p> China's recovery will lift global growth for the simple reason that China is a big part of the world economy. HSBC reckons that one year from now, in the first quarter of 2024, China's GDP could be as much as 10 per cent higher than it will be in the first three troubled months of 2023. According to our rough calculation, a recovering China could account for two-thirds of global growth in that period.</p><p> Over a longer period, however, China's recovery might have unfortunate side effects. In other big economies, the binding constraint on economic expansion is monetary policy, as central banks raise interest rates to suppress inflation. If China's reopening looks like raising global demand and therefore price pressure to an uncomfortable degree, central banks will tighten policy to offset the threat. In such a scenario, the impact of China's reopening on the rest of the world might show up not in higher growth, but in higher inflation or interest rates.</p><p> China's most direct channel of influence is via commodities. It consumes almost one-fifth of the world's oil, over half of refined copper, nickel and zinc, and more than three-fifths of iron ore. On Nov 4, the mere rumour of a reopening caused a 7 per cent increase in the price of copper by the end of the day. </p><p> As the rumours are realised, China's demand for metals, crops and energy will help exporters of commodities, hurt importers and give the world's central banks another headache in their fight against inflation.</p><p> China's demand for metals remained strong during zero-Covid, as the government encouraged spending on electric vehicles, renewable energy and green infrastructure, all of which require lots of aluminium, copper and other metals. But buyers lacked the confidence to stock up: inventories of copper fell to their skimpiest in 15 years. </p><p> Reopening will encourage restocking. In November, Goldman Sachs, a bank, reckoned the price of copper would increase to US$9,000 per tonne within 12 months. Now it thinks the price will reach US$11,000.</p><p> Demand for energy proved much less resilient, particularly towards the end of zero-Covid. China's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell by about one-fifth in the first 11 months of 2022, compared with the same period of the previous year. This allowed Europe to increase purchases to make up for the loss of gas from Russia. Thus, China's zero-Covid policy acted as a counterweight to Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- one blunder helping to save Europe from the other.</p><p> Analysts assume a modest rise in Chinese LNG imports this year, based on the contracts buyers have already signed and their reluctance to buy LNG when prices are high. If imports recover faster, Europe could feel the pinch. In a recent stress test, the International Energy Agency (IEA), an official forecaster, assumed Chinese demand would increase by about one-quarter in the year ahead, returning to 2021 levels; Russia would cut off piped gas to Europe entirely; and winter would start punctually. </p><p> In such a scenario, Europe would face a shortfall of 27 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to 7 per cent of annual demand, even after its current efforts to increase supply are taken into account. The IEA warns that if nothing else is done, Europe may be forced to introduce rationing.</p><p> The impact on oil could also be significant. If China's economy makes a full recovery in 2023, it will gradually increase crude imports throughout the year until it has added an average of one million barrels a day, reckons Soni Kumari of ANZ, a bank. This will compensate for reduced demand in Europe and America, both of which are courting recession. </p><p> Indeed, Goldman Sachs forecasts that China's increased appetite could push up oil prices by about US$15 per barrel. The price of Brent could exceed US$100 again in the third quarter of this year, it reckons, making the global battle against inflation still more difficult.</p><p> Higher commodity prices will be a boon to exporters such as Chile and Brazil, but hurt China's energy-importing neighbours. For India, the loss from higher prices may cancel out gains from increased exports to the mainland. Other countries, more tightly enmeshed in China's manufacturing supply chain, seem better placed to benefit. </p><p> But raw statistics can be deceptive. Although Taiwan's merchandise exports to the mainland were equivalent to more than 15 per cent of GDP in 2021, many were components for products that are ultimately sold to customers outside China, and may thus be unaffected by the change of policy.</p><p> The biggest boost to neighbours will come not from selling goods to China, but from selling tourist destinations to Chinese citizens. Ni Na, a mother-of-two from Shanghai, travelled overseas about five times a year before the pandemic, often spending three or four months a year outside the country. She attempted to travel once within China in 2022, only to give up in the face of restrictions. When inbound quarantine requirements are lifted, Ni will get back on the road. She has renewed her passport and her two sons' travel documents in anticipation.</p><p>Thailand, a popular destination, could enjoy a three-percentage-point boost to growth once China has fully reopened, reckons Goldman Sachs. That would remove the uncertainty that weighs on local asset prices, including the currency, says Arup Raha of Oxford Economics, a research firm. That, in turn, would reduce pressure on Thailand's central bank to raise rates -- welcome freedom in a country where output is still below potential. </p><p> But the biggest winner from reopening will be Hong Kong. Increased exports, which include tourism, could boost its GDP by almost 8 per cent after full reopening. The city used to attract more than four million mainland visitors a month. Without them, it has felt roomier but poorer.</p><p> Xi sells a U-turnThe Communist Party is deft at rewriting history to suit its needs. Yet Xi will struggle to shake the damage done to his reputation in 2022. The clumsy enforcement of zero-Covid, followed by its hasty abandonment, will go down as an error for the ages. </p><p> Many investment houses adjusted their risk assessments for China and will allocate less to the country over the next three years unless they are compensated for it. About US$18 billion of foreign exchange flowed out of China in November, up from US$11 billion in October. These outflows are expected to reverse when China's economy stabilises in 2023, but a swift return to the type of inflows witnessed prior to the pandemic is unlikely.</p><p> Deep damage has been done to parts of China's supply chain. A Covid outbreak, followed by protests, at a plant that makes Apple's iPhone 14 in central China has delayed orders for the product. For foreign firms, the crisis was the first time that central policy interfered with local officials' commitment to keep factories running. Many companies are now willing to pay higher costs to manufacture elsewhere. </p><p> Take the process of launching new products, which requires an almost continuous flow of researchers and scientists between headquarters, usually in the West, and plants in China. </p><p> The Covid years made this dance impossible. Engineers stopped visiting, and fewer new products were launched in the country. Multinational firms have been forced, often reluctantly, to launch elsewhere.</p><p> After three years of zero-Covid, executives have become comfortable with this move away from China. Inbound investment in new \"greenfield\" factories has slowed sharply, according to some measures. At the same time, the number of firms deciding to relocate operations outside of China has jumped, says Alex Bryant of East West Associates, a supply-chain consultant. Most of the relocations Bryant's firm has assisted with over the past year have been outbound. He thinks the reopening of China is unlikely to lead to an immediate turnaround in the direction of traffic.</p><p> Policymakers are waking up to the danger. Delegations of officials and businesspeople from Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Zhejiang and elsewhere are planning overseas trips to \"grab orders\" and win back investors, according to a state media report. \"A meeting is worth a thousand e-mails,\" it said. </p><p> In early December, China's leaders announced a focus on attracting foreign money, emphasising that local governments should prioritise finding investors. </p><p> Such language has not been used at a Politburo meeting in many years, notes Robin Xing of Morgan Stanley, a bank. \"They clearly want to keep their place in the global supply chain,\" he says. </p><p> Nevertheless, making up for the chaos of 2022 will require an awful lot of meetings. </p><p> (C)2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

As a result of the bigger park, the authorities had to find an alternative site for a school that was to be in the area.</p><p> NParks on Monday said that the upcoming Miltonia Nature Park will be part of a new Khatib Nature Corridor - an outcome of the NParks study and one of seven corridors that form a blueprint to create a network of green spaces here.</p><p> Each corridor links key habitats for wildlife using forested patches, parks, park connectors as well as tree-and shrub-lined routes known as nature ways. Most are connected to Singapore's green lung and largest nature reserve, the 2,000ha Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Parks between core habitats act as buffers to protect them, and as stepping stones between them for animals.</p><p> Nature Society (Singapore) president Shawn Lum said access to more habitats increases the effective population sizes of wildlife, and also gives them more food sources and more mates to choose from, which increases their chances of survival.</p><p> A larger effective population size lowers the risk of genetic disorders through inbreeding.</p><p> Besides this, nature corridors also allow redistribution and prevent overpopulation in Singapore's nature reserves, and increase the survival of animal-dispersed plant species, he added.</p><p> People can also benefit from nature parks and nature ways that are established in ecological corridors, said Dr Lum, as they \"offer the best educational and recreational spaces\".</p><p> The National University of Singapore's (NUS) Centre for Sustainable Asian Cities director Heng Chye Kiang said the green network may help to minimise human-animal conflicts within urbanised areas, if animals utilise corridors to move from one forest patch to another instead of wandering into built-up places.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;CHANGING APPROACH TO GREENERY&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Observers and those from the nature community said the NParks study and the establishment of nature corridors mark a shift in approach towards the conservation of Singapore's green spaces - an urgent task as much of the country's land has been developed.</p><p> Conservationist Ho Hua Chew said that in the past, the authorities were largely focused on the sustainability of wildlife habitats within their designated boundaries, but the long-term future of ecosystems in a particular area is now considered alongside its wider ecological landscape. The shift is in line with developments in the field of ecology, he said, adding that connectivity is critical for Singapore's increasingly fragmented and isolated natural habitats.</p><p> Urban policy researcher Woo Jun Jie said that besides scientific advancements, there has been a shift in policy thinking about nature conservation, reflected in Singapore's changing strategies for greenery over the years - from \"Garden City\" to \"City in a Garden\", and the present \"City in Nature\".</p><p> Dr Lum, a Nanyang Technological University (NTU) botanist, said establishing nature corridors following the NParks study is Singapore's \"best and last chance to build green infrastructure that will give habitats and wildlife a chance at long-term viability\".</p><p> The corridors closely follow conservation principles of protecting what one can, and connecting what is left, he said.</p><p> He said that in addition to building on land set aside for development, the Government is beginning to value \"spontaneous forests\" that have grown on them, and how they are part of a wider green network, before development decisions are made.</p><p> That conservation attention has shifted to these smaller pockets of nature is a result of the intensification of land use in Singapore over the years, said geographer Harvey Neo, as large green tracts similar to the Central Catchment area can no longer be found.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;GREEN NETWORK'S IMPLICATIONS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Experts said that while the islandwide connectivity map NParks' study has produced does not confer legal protections on any green spaces, planning around nature corridors and developing in a manner sensitive to nature will have effects on developments to come.</p><p> Citing Dover Forest, where the authorities put off plans to develop its western half for about a decade as the study showed it could form part of a nature corridor, Professor Heng said brownfield sites - land that has already been developed - may need to be redeveloped more intensively so that ecologically sensitive areas can be protected.</p><p> Mammal scientist Marcus Chua of NUS' Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum said that the network helps planners to prioritise which green spaces to conserve, and also removes guesswork when nature corridors are designed.</p><p> Dr Woo, who is a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said that when green plots along identified corridors need to be developed, conducting environmental impact assessments and extensive consultation over the development and rezoning of green spaces will most likely cause some delays in development and construction, which can be costly.</p><p> \"Even efforts to rezone or integrate green spaces into urban developments will incur additional development and construction costs,\" he said.</p><p> On the other hand, urban development and building construction may not sufficiently price in the costs of environmental degradation that may occur when green spaces - which are carbon sinks and help to mitigate urban heat - are developed, said Dr Woo.</p><p> \"The costs incurred in conserving these spaces should therefore be thought of as an investment in Singapore's future and a contribution to our fight against climate change,\" he said.</p><p> Dr Neo, a senior fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities, said he hopes the wildlife corridors will make developers more attentive to environmental impact studies before development. This could persuade them not to develop, or to proceed with modifications to their plans, he said.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;ROOM TO IMPROVE CORRIDORS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;While nature corridors may facilitate the movement of some species, conservation experts said that not all will be able to use them, and the needs of such species will have to be considered as well.</p><p> NTU adjunct research fellow Ngo Kang Min said the best way to assess if corridors will work is for those designing them to put themselves in the place of an animal and understand its life history and behavioural traits.</p><p> Pangolins, for instance, spend most of their time in the forest and rarely venture out, she said. So even if a thin nature way has been spruced up by multi-tiered vegetation near a busy road, it is unlikely that a pangolin, which tends to be affected by road vibrations and sounds of traffic, would use it.</p><p> Dr Lum said that while the NParks study has given the authorities a good sense of which animals may use corridors, it is worthwhile studying which species will not utilise them, so that other provisions can be made for their conservation if necessary.</p><p> He said that for the corridors identified, the quality and placement of nature ways should also be scrutinised. How nature ways are designed, what plant species are planted in them and how areas with breaks are connected will affect their effectiveness as corridors, said Dr Lum.</p><p> While acknowledging that the public and stakeholders are now consulted much earlier than in the past for potential developments, Dr Ngo noted that the approach to conservation is still top-down, and said she hopes details of the study will be made available so researchers can provide their feedback and help by contributing data to refine it.</p><p> Mr Chua said modelling done in the land study can be strengthened using empirical data from genetic tests on wildlife to study existing gene flow, or by fieldwork to determine if animals are using the corridors as intended.</p><p> Dr Ho said that where established corridors are long, it will be good to safeguard forested areas along them that will act as a resting point and feeding ground for animals before they arrive at their destination. Besides serving local wildlife populations, these stepping stones will be a wintering haven for migratory birds, he said.</p><p> For its part, NParks has said that ecological profiling is a continuous and iterative process, and its plans will be refined when needed.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Three decades since Singaporeans started using park connectors, the park connector network is today more than 300km long, and there are plans to bring this figure to 500km by 2030.</p><p> Like this network, building a network of wildlife corridors, establishing nature parks, and restoring Singapore's habitats where feasible will be a long-term endeavour, said Dr Lum.</p><p> \"Nature gets richer over time, and the work we are doing now may not be enjoyed by our children or even their children, but by the generations to come,\" he said.</p><p>    FOR A BETTER FUTURE  Nature gets richer over time, and the work we are doing now may not be enjoyed by our children or even their children, but by the generations to come.</p><p>    NATURE SOCIETY (SINGAPORE) PRESIDENT SHAWN LUM </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The shift is in line with developments in the field of ecology, he said, adding that connectivity is critical for Singapore's increasingly fragmented and isolated natural habitats.

Countries in general and Asean in particular have sought to recalibrate their postures and policies as a function of the BRI's ongoing evolution. Such calculations are further complicated by competing initiatives, such as the US Build Act, which also seeks to support infrastructure opportunities in the region as part of the US Indo-Pacific strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The BRI is at once an aspirational idea and a development platform, offering both abstract hope for a better world and a host of concrete commercial opportunities. The BRI is a repository for many of the world's emerging development goals, ranging from the digital economy to sustainable infrastructure, and more broadly, frictionless trade and the narrowing of wealth gaps. It offers the promise of a new development paradigm, but one that must be seized with nuance and sophistication. For Asean, this means sifting through the opportunities to advance regional goals while preserving Asean centrality.</p><p>The path towards implementing the BRI and realising its promise has not been linear. Early BRI projects engendered criticism regarding unsustainable financing practices and the insufficient involvement of the local labour force. Such criticism resulted in the Second Belt and Road Forum of 2017 reaffirming the need to adopt global best practices and giving rise to the mantra \"open, clean and green\" to capture the need for transparency and sustainability in BRI projects.</p><p>The pandemic has constituted another bump in the road, resulting in work stoppages, a raft of legal claims and an environment rife with uncertainty and unpredictability. Still, the obstacles wrought by Covid-19 have a positive side, offering parties an enforced time-out to rethink the types of projects and commercial terms to be proposed as a function of their suitability for local conditions.</p><p>EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES</p><p>Moreover, even as large-scale infrastructure projects encounter difficulties, commercial parties have scope to explore other opportunities linked to the digital economy and the health field, both of which find expression in the BRI's proposals for the companion Digital and Health Silk Roads. The Covid-induced pause gives parties the opportunity to rethink the scale of their projects and to incorporate notions such as \"glocalisation\" that capture the need to \"tame\" globalisation in a way that yields benefits for local communities. The BRI will be international in scope and spirit, but local in planning and implementation or it will not be.</p><p>The world, Asean, and the BRI are at an inflection point at once pregnant with promise and peril. The pandemic must be managed; the promise and commercial opportunity of the BRI must be seized. The former requires sensible health policies and collective discipline, both of which are manifesting themselves in the region. The latter requires an astute assessment of the region's strengths and weaknesses measured against a world economy in a state of structural flux and transition.</p><p>In a September 2020 report by McKinsey &amp; Company entitled Reimagining Emerging ASEAN in the Wake of Covid-19, the following areas were identified as levers of growth: manufacturing; green infrastructure; digitisation; reskilling and redeployment; and high-value food production. Specific Asean jurisdictions have comparative advantages in one or more of these fields. All of these strategic capabilities and sectors are thus in play, with their importance having been further amplified by the fallout from Covid-19 and the opportunities for restructuring presented by the BRI. Moreover, Asean and its professionals are ideally placed to lead the way armed with both international and local knowledge and benefitting from a highly strategic location.</p><p>The Asean Economic Community, the Master Plan on Connectivity 2025, and the recently released Digital Master Plan, anticipated this macro-restructuring and the related changes in the nature of work and production. The Singapore Manufacturing Federation has further identified 3D printing as a priority area that will doubtless respond to issues of \"glocalisation\" and local participation in the fruits of development by rendering manufacturing more flexible.</p><p>All of the above dovetail with the BRI's focus on enhanced connectivity and the establishment of stable supply chains. There is thus an unprecedented opportunity to join the global development platform of the BRI with regional and local goals even amidst the chaos wrought by the pandemic.</p><p>ASPIRATION AND REALISATION</p><p>The bridge between aspiration and realisation will be the professionals designing and implementing the projects to be carried out under, or in conjunction with, the BRI umbrella.

By 2030, Singapore's government and statutory boards will issue up to $35 billion in green bonds to fund public sector green infrastructure projects.</p><p>The government will publish a Singapore Green Bond framework and issue its inaugural green bond later this year.</p><p>The first such bond by a statutory board here was announced last August. Then, the National Environment Agency issued a $3 billion multi-currency medium-term note and green bond framework, with proceeds going to sustainable infrastructure development projects like the Tuas Nexus, Singapore's first integrated water and solid waste treatment facility.</p><p>The move to issue green bonds is welcome, but investors are becoming more critical of such schemes amid claims of greenwashing, says Yu-En Ong, head of Singapore at Norton Rose Fulbright. \"Investors are demanding more transparency and diligence to ensure that this financial product meets the sustainability criteria,\" says Ong.</p><p>Carbon tax 'too aggressive'?</p><p>In addition, Singapore will raise its carbon tax rate in stages from now till 2030, growing up to 16 times the current rate of $5 per tonne of emissions.</p><p>The rate will first rise to $25/tonne in 2024 and 2025, before hiking further to $45/tonne in 2026 and 2027. By 2030, Singapore's carbon tax rate will reach between $50 and $80 per tonne.</p><p>Singapore's carbon tax applies to all facilities producing 25,000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions in a year. This covers some 30 to 40 large emitters, like oil refineries and power generation plants, which contribute 80% of Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions. By putting a price on emissions, companies are incentivised to reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p>The move is \"very bold\", says Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank. \"It may even be seen as too aggressive from members of industry and companies.\"</p><p>From a societal point of view, however, it is the right thing to do, adds Ling. \"What's important is that the additional carbon tax revenue will be channelled into solutions. So, the focus is to invest in costly low-carbon infrastructure, green the aviation and tourism industries and capture economic opportunities in areas such as green finance.\"</p><p>Even at its 2030 peak, however, Singapore's carbon tax rate will still pale in comparison to that of other countries.</p><p>Ireland, for example, charges about EUR41 ($62) per tonne, while Sweden has the highest carbon tax rate of about SEK1,200 ($173) per tonne. Singaporean investment company Temasek has an internal carbon price of US$42 ($56) per tonne.</p><p>Carbon pricing varies wildly around the world. Yet, the global average emissions price is only US$3 per tonne, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>Last June, the IMF proposed an international carbon price floor, divided into three tiers. To address such inconsistencies, each tonne of emissions should, by 2030, cost a minimum of US$75, US$50 or US$25, depending on whether the emission is in an advanced, high- or low-income market, says the IMF.</p><p>Singapore must be prepared to review its carbon prices regularly, says Cherine Fok, director of sustainability services at KPMG in Singapore. \"We have to be conscious that the new pricing of [carbon] is estimated based on the current projections around the urgency and scale of climate transition. It is also pegged to carbon regimes across the world.\"</p><p>She adds: \"Whether the revised pricing and the timing of the revisions remain fit  for an open economy like Singapore remains to be seen. As a nation, we must be prepared to review our plan of action regularly to ensure its effectiveness.\"</p><p>Cushioning the blow</p><p>With a higher carbon tax, household utility bills will rise in tandem, says Wong. At a rate of $25/tonne, for example, a household living in a four-room HDB flat will see an increase of about $4 per month in utility bills.</p><p>Wong says in his Budget speech: \"I should clarify that I do not expect to derive additional revenue from this increase in the carbon tax.\"</p><p>\"Some of the revenue will be used to cushion the impact on households and businesses,\" adds Wong. \"A large part of the revenue will be used to support a decisive shift towards decarbonisation through investments in new low-carbon and more energy-efficient solutions.\"</p><p>To that end, the government will give households additional U-Save rebates to cushion this price hike, and more details will be announced in next year's Budget.</p><p>From 2024, the government will allow businesses to use \"high-quality, international carbon credits\" to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions. \"This will create local demand for high-quality carbon credits,\" says Wong. A carbon credit is a permit that allows a company to emit one tonne of greenhouse gas.</p><p>The carbon tax rate hike is not about increasing revenues for the government, says Saravanan Rathakrishnan, associate at law firm RHTLaw Asia. Rather, it will contribute to the greening of Singapore and its economy, \"which puts it in good stead for green finance and ESG-related investments - a new frontier for growth\".</p><p>While there may be temporary increases in costs of doing business in Singapore, these will be largely transitory as firms learn to adapt, Rathakrishnan tells The Edge Singapore.</p><p>Higher carbon taxes will also force landlords to upgrade old buildings to become more energy-efficient, says Tay Hong Beng, partner and head of real estate at KPMG in Singapore.</p><p>\"The progressive increase in carbon tax will eventually lead to an increase in utility prices, and landlords may seek to pass on the increase to their tenants. However, increasing utility costs will make older, less energy-efficient buildings unattractive to tenants,\" says Tay.</p><p>Tay adds: \"To maintain occupancy levels, landlords of older buildings will eventually need to invest in making their buildings more energy-efficient. As retrofitting projects take time to implement, landlords may discover that it makes economic sense to undertake improvements sooner, rather than wait for the further increases in carbon tax, which we know will happen.\"</p><p>The increase of Singapore's carbon tax will \"decisively\" move the needle on Singapore's decarbonisation roadmap, says Tan Wooi Leong, senior director, energy and industrial, Surbana Jurong.</p><p>\"At this revised carbon tax rate, mid- to heavy-duty transport sectors may accelerate their electrification or even adopt hydrogen as fuel. Industries in petroleum and chemicals, iron and steel, cement and other major greenhouse gas emitters will see more value in adopting renewable energy, electrifying their processes and/or introducing new energy alternatives in their operations,\" adds Tan.</p><p>This will affect nearly all sectors in Singapore. Says Tan: \"Major logistics firms have begun to study the feasibility of decarbonising entire trucking fleets. Real estate developers are exploring low carbon construction materials and energy-efficient solutions for their developments.\"</p><p>More EV charging points</p><p>Singapore aims to be a \"car-lite\" city, and will maintain its zero growth rate for private vehicles alongside plans to phase out internal combustion engines by 2040.</p><p>While public transport is still the cleanest mode of transport, Singaporeans have embraced electric vehicles (EVs), says Wong. The share of EVs among new car registrations here has jumped from 0.2% in 2020 to 4% last year.</p><p>Singapore will further accelerate EV adoption by building more charging points, with such infrastructure financed by green bonds.Satya Ramamurthy, partner at KPMG in Singapore, says: \"Accessibility of EV charging infrastructure nationwide will be critical to the continued growth momentum in Singaporeans' adoption of EVs.\"</p><p>The green initiatives announced at Budget 2022 are \"a bold but welcome statement\", says Sharad Somani, partner and head of infrastructure advisory at KPMG in Singapore. \"Budget 2022 proposes a robust, three-pronged approach to increase carbon tax, innovate low-carbon technologies and turbo-charge the green finance ecosystem in Singapore.

In Southeast Asia, we are battling new waves of the virus. We must be prepared to live with an endemic COVID-19 for years to come.</p><p>Before the crisis, no one could have predicted the length and devastating trajectory of the pandemic. Nor how COVID-19 has accelerated structural shifts, and created new ones. The global switch to digital is dramatic, with many activities moving online like today.

Trade has boomed, growing by more than 60-fold. ASEAN and China are now each other's biggest trading partners.</p><p>While COVID-19 has set back the global economy, the fundamentals in the region remain sound. There are 2 billion people in Southeast Asia and China, with one of the fastest growing middle classes in the world. There is large potential for catch-up growth, as most parts of Asia are still emerging. Beyond catch-up, we must seek to ride on the fourth industrial revolution.

One important way is to strengthen the rules-based multilateral framework for trade and investments. The ASEAN-China FTA is a cornerstone agreement that has benefited all members. Let us work towards upgrading this Agreement, to reduce non tariff measures and address new priorities, especially for the digital economy. As we prepare to resume cross-border travel, we should rebuild our aviation links and further liberalise the ASEAN-China Air Transport Agreement to boost our region's connectivity.</p><p>Beyond ASEAN and China, we must maintain the momentum for global trade liberalisation, and build confidence in multilateralism. RCEP, which was signed between ASEAN Member States, China, and four other major trading partners is an important next step. Covering one-third of the world's population and one-third of global GDP, this is the biggest trade agreement in history. When the RCEP comes into force, it will further strengthen economic integration in the region. And we look forward to welcoming India to join the RCEP when they are ready. Closer economic integration in Asia will better enable us to realise the potential of the region, and contribute to global economic development.</p><p>Beyond FTAs, we should explore new building blocks to strengthen cooperation, to seek new sources of growth and address global challenges. Let me cite two - digital collaboration and sustainable development.</p><p>Digital collaboration will be a key building block for the future. COVID-19 has accelerated the global shift to digital, and we must move swiftly to respond to this shift. Let us further strengthen collaboration. One way is to pilot more city-to-city projects. The Smart City Initiative between Singapore and Shenzhen is an example, where we are digitalising end-to-end trade financing. We welcome collaboration with more interested partners. At the country level, we can establish Digital Economy Agreements. Singapore concluded such agreements with Australia, Chile, and New Zealand. We look forward to signing more. Over time, these agreements can contribute towards the development of common global frameworks and standards. This will ensure that cross border transactions and digital exchanges, including e-payments and data flows, are safe, secure, and efficient. This will enable us to better reap the potential of the digital economy.</p><p>Besides digital collaboration, a second key building block for the next phase of ASEAN-China cooperation is sustainable development. Climate change is an existential challenge. I hope that the 26th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP 26, later this year will achieve good global outcomes. Both ASEAN and China understand the urgency of the challenge - we have designated 2021 as the ASEAN-China Year of Sustainable Development Cooperation. As we seek to emerge from this crisis, we can focus on catalysing a green recovery - from investing in buildings that are more energy-efficient, to exploring cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind. Given the large infrastructure funding needs, we will need to improve the flow of cross-border capital and crowd in private funding. China's Belt and Road Initiative or BRI is an important initiative, and a 'Green BRI' will be a major step in catalysing green infrastructure. Within ASEAN, the Catalytic Green Finance Facility was established to provide loans and technical assistance for green infrastructure projects. Singapore is also contributing to this green recovery effort through Infrastructure Asia to facilitate the flow of funds and expertise to bridge the infrastructure gap. We will also be issuing up to US$15 billion in green bonds for public infrastructure projects. Besides reducing carbon emission at source, we must also explore carbon sequestration - the long-term capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Nature-based solutions can provide one-third of the global mitigation necessary to stabilise warming to below 2 degree Celsius. With more than one-third of the world's mangroves and up to 120 million hectares of land for re-forestation, Southeast Asia has significant potential to contribute to nature-based solutions for carbon capture. Again, to realise this potential, we need to catalyse investments. One important building block is to set common standards, improve traceability, and create vibrant exchanges for the trading of carbon credits. Singapore will be launching one such global carbon exchange - \"Climate Impact X\" - later this year. This will allow large-scale, high-quality carbon credits to be sold through standardised contracts, and crowd in more investment.</p><p>To realise the promise of these building blocks, all stakeholders - governments, businesses, workers and communities - must be part of this effort. Business China has a valuable role, by providing platforms and opportunities for stakeholders to deepen collaborations, and forge new partnerships. If we can all work together, the ASEAN-China economic relationship will continue to deepen and broaden.</p><p>Managing Differences Constructively</p><p>But ASEAN-China relations are not confined to economic relations. There is a broader strategic context. Even as we deepen the ASEAN-China economic relationship, we must also manage the friction and disputes well. Otherwise, the progress could be undermined.</p><p>Relations between neighbours are often more complicated than relations between distant countries. Beyond specific issues, tensions and anxieties are often exacerbated by the disparity of size. These dynamics are further accentuated when Southeast Asian countries are concerned about being caught up in the intensifying strategic competition between the US and China.</p><p>Relations between all countries - big and small - must be conducted within the framework of international law. And this includes the resolution of disputes. There are important issues to be resolved between China and some Southeast Asia nations. These include competing claims in the South China Sea, and concerns over environmental degradation in the Mekong region. The key is to manage these disputes in a rational manner, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS, and with guardrails to ensure that tensions do not escalate out of control.</p><p>As much as we have made good progress on trade, we can make similar progress to resolve difficult issues. For instance, the South China Sea dispute is difficult to resolve, as various stakeholders are locked into entrenched positions. But we can and we must do all we can to reduce the risk of miscalculations. I am glad that ASEAN Member States and China are in negotiations on a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, with the second reading of the Single Draft Negotiating Text underway.</p><p>Within ASEAN, we must also continue to forge stronger unity and stability. a. ASEAN has made good progress since its founding in 1967. But the continuing crisis in Myanmar is a grave problem. It is disappointing that the Five-Point Consensus that was secured at the ASEAN Leaders' Meeting in Jakarta in April this year has not been implemented expeditiously. We continue to call for an immediate cessation of violence by all parties, the release of all political detainees, and meaningful negotiations and dialogue amongst key stakeholders to achieve a durable political solution that is in the interest of Myanmar's people. ASEAN must stand ready to help and to support mediation if possible.</p><p>Open and Inclusive Regional Architecture</p><p>I have touched on the new building blocks of ASEAN-China cooperation, and the importance of managing differences that may arise.</p><p>But just as importantly, stability and prosperity in Asia depends on our continued openness and engagement of all major partners.</p><p>Asia has prospered because of the favourable strategic context underpinned by US presence in the region after the Second World War.The US provided the foundations for global trade to flourish - through its efforts to champion an open, integrated, and rules based global order. Its security presence also contributed to regional security, ensuring that sea lines of communication remain safe and open. American companies have invested extensively in the region, bringing with them not just capital, but ideas and technology. This has benefited the region as a whole, including Southeast Asia and China.</p><p>US presence in the region will continue to be an important stabiliser. We welcome the US' renewed focus on Asia under the Biden Administration. The TPP would have further strengthened the US's ties with the region. Their withdrawal was regrettable, but we welcome the US to re-join the CPTPP when it is possible to do so.</p><p>It is not just US or China that have significant influence in the region. Japan has made major contributions, and stepped up in pushing for the completion of the CPTPP after the US withdrew. India too has been an engine of growth for the region, with its large market and fast-expanding middle class. Australia, New Zealand and South Korea also have important roles to play, as do European countries such as France, Germany, and the UK.</p><p>So even as we create new building blocks between ASEAN and China, we must bear in mind that - an open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based region ultimately benefits all countries - ASEAN, China, US and all major trading partners.</p><p>But the biggest challenge that the region faces is the strategic competition between US and China. Relations between the two major powers have become less volatile under the Biden Administration, but the underlying tensions remain. In the US, there is a strong bipartisan consensus, backed by growing public support, that China is the US' main strategic competitor. The US has rallied its allies and partners by re-energising its ties with the G7, NATO in Europe, and the Quad in Asia. On China's part, it wants to stake its rightful position in the world. The Chinese Communist Party celebrates its centennial this month, a significant milestone. Next year, it will hold the 20th Party Congress. We can expect that China will continue to take a firm stance on issues that it deems as its \"core interests\", such as Taiwan.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, tensions are unlikely to abate. But despite their differences, it is in the interest of both the US and China to cooperate on common challenges. For a start, there is common interest between both parties to tackle COVID 19, coordinate global economic recovery, and address the long-term challenge of climate change. I am glad that both sides have acknowledged that there are areas of shared interests that they can work on together, and have stepped up bilateral exchanges. The key to stability for Southeast Asia and the world is for the two major powers to focus on expanding common ground while preventing tensions from boiling over, as they settle into a new modus vivendi.</p><p>For ASEAN, we do not expect to change the course of the strategic competition, but we must do all that we can to keep the region open and inclusive. It is not a question of choosing sides, but of retaining our ability to make choices for ourselves, to advance our collective interest, and do what is best for our peoples. Our region must remain firmly anchored on ASEAN's own interests, and continue to build a regional architecture that is open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based.</p><p>This is what ASEAN Centrality is about. I am glad that both the US and China have expressed their support for ASEAN Centrality. This shows an appreciation for the notion that a strong and stable ASEAN is not just good for ASEAN Member States, but also good for the world. We should also look out for areas where ASEAN can collaborate with both the US and China, especially in areas where we all have common interest.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In conclusion, Southeast Asia's relationship with China has come a long way since formal dialogue relations began three decades ago.</p><p>To further deepen this relationship, we should continue to strengthen the foundational building blocks of our relationship, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, whilst creating new building blocks of cooperation, in new areas such as digital collaboration and sustainable development. At the same time, we must manage any differences in a constructive manner. And even as we strengthen ASEAN-China cooperation, the region must remain open to all partners.</p><p>In this way, I am confident that our region will continue to remain a vibrant node of economic activity, and key engine of growth for the world for years to come.</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["As we seek to emerge from this crisis, we can focus on catalysing a green recovery - from investing in buildings that are more energy-efficient, to exploring cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind.

At this stage of the pandemic, the additional policy supports and accelerated vaccine rollouts in advanced economies have improved their near-term recovery prospects. These economies could start policy normalisation earlier than expected. Long-term interest rates in some advanced economies have already risen on positive outlooks and inflation concerns, rattling global financial markets.</p><p>A return to more normal interest rates could trigger another \"taper tantrum\" among Asia's emerging markets, including those in Asean. To address this, we should reinforce regional financial safety nets such as the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation to cushion any possible spillovers from global shocks.</p><p>The pandemic has also shown how fragile global trade and supply chains can be. While I believe globalisation will eventually return, it will take a different shape, requiring our renewed commitment to regional cooperation and integration by deepening regional trade and diversifying supply chains.</p><p>REDUCING BOTTLENECKS</p><p>The reconfiguration of global supply chains offers Asean economies a great opportunity to establish themselves as reliable new suppliers and to attract investment. To enhance competitiveness, Asean economies should reduce behind-the-border bottlenecks such as non-tariff barriers and restrictive regulations, continue improving trade logistics and efficiency, and promote paperless trade.</p><p>We also need to reduce health vulnerabilities and lift regional health security.</p><p>ADB supports the Asean Strategic Framework for Public Health Emergencies and the establishment of Regional Reserves for Medical Supplies - which will help the region better respond to future disease outbreaks and pandemics.</p><p>ADB will use its US$9 billion Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, or APVAX, to support Asean's Vaccine Security and Self-Reliance. The region already has strong vaccine manufacturing capacities in Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, which can facilitate swift and fair distribution of Covid-19 vaccines despite near-term global supply bottlenecks.</p><p>The second key issue is improving domestic resource mobilisation. This will be indispensable as a foundation for lasting recovery. It can be achieved by strengthening tax systems and closing loopholes through international tax cooperation, deepening local currency bond markets, and catalysing green finance.</p><p>The pandemic pushed many economies into fiscal deficits and higher debt, making domestic resource mobilisation a top policy priority for sustained post-pandemic recovery.</p><p>The average 14 per cent tax-to-GDP ratio in Asean is low compared to the average for developing Asia and the OECD, leaving room for improvement in boosting revenue generation and strengthening tax collection in Asean. Appropriate tax policy measures will be needed to strengthen the tax base and improve tax compliance once the region is on track to full recovery.</p><p>International tax cooperation can also help fight tax avoidance and evasion. The rise of the borderless digital economy makes it easier for multinationals to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions and exploit tax loopholes. With the increase in multinational investments in growing Asean markets, we need to ensure that all parties pay their fair share of taxes.</p><p>To date, six Asean countries - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam - are members of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, under which more than 130 developed and developing economies are collaborating closely to tackle the issue of tax avoidance.</p><p>Eight Asean countries - Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam - are members of the Global Forum, which is committed to the automatic exchange of information critical to combatting tax evasion.</p><p>The second key measure to enhance domestic resource mobilisation is to foster local currency bond markets. Local currency bond markets are an effective funding source for increased fiscal spending, while also providing central banks an additional avenue for injecting liquidity into markets and cash-strapped businesses to safeguard financial stability.</p><p>Asean's local currency bond markets have expanded significantly over the past two decades. In particular, thematic bonds, such as green, social, and sustainability bonds can help finance green infrastructure and inclusive recovery. While they remain a small fraction of the total market size, thematic bonds outstanding increased six-fold since 2017. ADB is committed to working with Asean to reinforce this trend.</p><p>SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE</p><p>Finally, a green and innovative financing mechanism can help Asean countries to effectively mobilise financial resources and increase investment in quality, climate-resilient infrastructure.</p><p>The Asean Catalytic Green Financing Facility, or ACGF, under the Asian Infrastructure Fund, is owned by Asean countries together with ADB and receives administration support from ADB.

Yet the Emerging Stronger Taskforce, supported by the Government and comprising industry representatives, has just released its public report with forward-looking recommendations, even as the pandemic continues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> FROM NOW INTO TOMORROW In the face of so many present challenges, there is a need to consider pathways to emerge stronger. This is not only a question about gazing into the future and faraway. Steps are already being taken to adapt to the changing circumstances, and these initiatives should be recognised and encouraged.</p><p> Take local food operators for instance. They suffered drastically in the circuit breaker and, again, will be impacted by the current measures that curtail dining in. Yet this time around, many more of them are ready to accept orders online or by SMS, and have arranged for delivery options. This transition is taking place not only among the big boys and upper-end establishments, but also includes hawkers and coffee shops.</p><p> This is but one example of how the online economy is becoming everyday and for everyone. Retailers and other sectors now realise that going online is no longer a choice but a necessity. The digital economy was given a significant boost by the pandemic, and can only grow bigger and broader.</p><p> A much larger transformation of our industries and supply chains can be supported with technology, combined with more resilient and reliable logistics to get physical goods to their final destinations, not just in Singapore but across the region and beyond. This is one of the implications of the task force's recommendation that Singapore should be a \"virtually unlimited\" economy.</p><p> CONNECTING TO THE WORLD The task force has also said that Singapore should continue to be relevant as a hub for business, work and leisure, resuming travel safely through the use of technology. Some will protest that this flies in the face of current facts.</p><p> The World Economic Forum has just cancelled its much-touted plans to hold its annual meeting here. Attempts to establish travel bubbles, for instance with Hong Kong, have repeatedly collapsed. Some of the surge in current cases in Singapore can also be traced to Changi Airport and the harbour, precisely at the interconnections between Singapore and the world.</p><p> Yet there is truth in that Singapore has always gained from being open to the world and must again seek ways to do so, safely and securely. Indeed, there is a case to be made that being able to reopen can create an even greater premium for Singapore. To support this, there must of course be sufficient reserve capacity in our testing, tracing and treatment for Covid-19.</p><p> The potential role for Singapore goes beyond the pandemic. The ongoing Sino-American rivalry will have major repercussions for trade and supply chains, and may also fragment the digital economy.</p><p> If Singapore can be a vital node that cooperates with both great powers, as well as other major economies like the European Union and Japan, this would again multiply our current and future value proposition. In this context, the task force's call for Singapore to resist the forces of anti-globalisation and protectionism by remaining open is correct.</p><p> There is a need to foster a reservoir of confidence, trust and goodwill among the people for Singapore to be open and serve as a hub. Understanding and buy-in from the public about the benefits will be necessary. If Singapore is to remain open, in good times and especially in these present trying circumstances, more must be convinced that this is our past, present and future role.</p><p> GREENING THE REGION A third area to consider is Singapore's steps forward on sustainability and climate action. The task force's recommendation is that Singapore should establish itself as a carbon trading and services hub, including the development of a carbon market with the ancillary capacity for companies to measure, mitigate and offset their carbon footprints.</p><p> Take this in the context of the Green Plan detailed during Budget 2021, a landmark undertaking by five ministries and the Government as a whole. There is considerable momentum in R&amp;D and green finance to support this effort and enable adoption by the private sector in Singapore.</p><p> Yet while the starting point is at the national level, Singapore's capabilities in technology and finance will have greater positive impact and be more commercially attractive when we look across our region. Identifying and enabling regional opportunities sets the context for the task force's recommendations for sustainability. Other initiatives that become more viable and impactful at a regional scale include energy transitions, the development of green infrastructure, and even nature-based solutions to carbon emissions and climate concerns. There are other and additional steps that may bear discussion, particularly on sustainability and Singapore's regional engagements.</p><p> There is much else in the task force's report that merits consideration and response, not only by the Government and corporations but also by workers and citizens.</p><p> When the Singapore Institute of International Affairs served as a knowledge partner for the task force, we were heartened that its co-chair, National Development Minister Desmond Lee, acknowledged that the task force does not have a \"monopoly of ideas\", and that it hopes to tap \"collective wisdom\" in Singapore. This is the right frame to read the report - as an impetus to consider what is happening, and what could happen next, for the better.</p><p> The situation may be uncertain and tense for now, and discussion often huddles around urgent risks and immediate actions. Yet one clear lesson from times of crisis is the need to also anticipate what may come next. New realities and trends are already emerging amid the pandemic and will not wait for the tardy. Those who can respond quickly, and then evaluate and prepare for that emerging future, will be well placed to prosper.</p><p>\u00b7 Simon Tay is chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, where Aaron Choo is senior assistant director.

If nothing is done, the economic impact of climate change will be profound - estimated GDP per capita loss for Asean members range from 0.7 per cent to 8.5 per cent by 2100. And this doesn't even take into account societal or environmental impacts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> However, as we emerge from the pandemic, there's an opportunity to build back better and help reboot our economies by moving away from high-emission pathways and changing the behaviour of businesses and people.</p><p> To achieve this, Asean governments must be both tactical and structural in their approach. Doing this provides immediate changes while building long-term structural frameworks that will lure institutional investment and shift behaviour at every level of society. In short, a complete rewiring of the economy.</p><p> How do we go about this'</p><p> Governments must first take a tactical approach to their economic recoveries.</p><p> The Asean Comprehensive Recovery Framework (ACRF) is the region's \"exit strategy\" from the Covid-19 crisis and sets out seven priorities under the broad strategy, including promoting sustainable finance, to building green infrastructure and facilitating the transition to sustainable energy.</p><p> Asean should link the ACRF and its implementation plan with their climate change and sustainable development agendas. This will act as a catalyst for change across the board; with governments setting the agenda, the private sector will be in a better position to mobilise.</p><p> This will stimulate institutional and foreign direct investment to fund the green transition.</p><p> According to the United Nations, countries are falling far short of what is required to achieve the targets set out in the Paris Agreement.</p><p> Covid-19 acts as the opportunity for governments to recharge their approach to climate change, but in order for these climate pledges to make long term and broad-based change, much of the economic activities that have been built up over the last century and a half must be rewired to fundamentally alter their emission trajectories.</p><p> Asean governments can focus on three key areas of structural change which have far-reaching impact in recalibrating economies:</p><p> 1. DEVELOPING AN ASEAN TAXONOMY The ACRF identifies green finance as a key mechanism to \"contain\" the drop in other sources of financing caused by the pandemic.</p><p> To generate broad-based use of green finance, a unified language in the form of taxonomy is needed to ensure that all participants work towards the same environmental objectives.</p><p> Asean has seen pockets of development on this front. Singapore recently issued a consultation paper on a green and transition taxonomy for financial institutions. Malaysia's Bank Negara will soon enforce its own taxonomy that sets out a common language to categorise economic activities based on their impact on climate change.</p><p> But overall, Asean still lacks cohesive definition on what is considered green or in transition, which will deter institutional investment in much-needed infrastructure.</p><p> Asean should leverage and align with ongoing global efforts to harmonise taxonomies.</p><p> 2. A FRAMEWORK FOR ESG RISK ASSESSMENT Institutional investors are hungry to invest in sustainable infrastructure, which can offer stable, long-term returns. Recognising this, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Singapore's Infrastructure Asia inked a cooperation pact in 2019 to help regional governments develop bankable and sustainable infrastructure projects.</p><p> But project participants - banks, developers, investors and governments - need a common framework to assess environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks.</p><p> Asean governments must work together to develop such a framework. The International Finance Corporation's Environmental and Social Performance Standards and the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement are a good starting point.</p><p> 3. THE POWER OF SOVEREIGN DEBT Infrastructure investment will drive economic recovery following the pandemic, and the Green Social and Sustainability (GSS) bond market has a significant role to play in financing the transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient economy.</p><p> Given that sovereigns make up almost half of the volume of the global bond market, their leadership role is critical and the ball of change lies in their court.</p><p> South-east Asia has had some success in this regard. Indonesia issued its first sovereign green sukuk in 2018, and the Singapore Government has just announced its intention to issue green bonds to spark infrastructure investment. But the rest of the region still lags behind.</p><p> Increasing the number of GSS issuance among Asean members should be a key objective for governments, central banks and development finance institutions.</p><p> Sovereign GSS bonds attract investors and in turn demonstrate investor demand.</p><p> Public policy globally is clearly taking a green turn. Our economies must start the transition if we are to have a sustainable future.</p><p> If Governments choose to take both a pragmatic and long-term approach, they can prompt a shift in the behaviour of every level of society - from statutory boards, to corporates and consumers.</p><p> Financial institutions have a significant role to play too. For example, HSBC is proposing several new climate resolutions at its upcoming AGM, including phasing-out the financing of coal and publishing annual progress reports.</p><p> It's a delicate balance. A balance that Asean must achieve as we emerge from this pandemic. What's needed is coordination, collaboration and pragmatism.</p><p> Climate change is a threat we can no longer ignore.

DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han agreed that both countries were well positioned to unlock new growth opportunities in green development, including circular economy, renewable energy, green finance and green infrastructure. They also welcomed the good momentum in legal and judicial cooperation. Our Supreme Courts signed an MOU on Cooperation on Information on Foreign Law, which would further develop the legal infrastructure in support of the Belt and Road Initiative.</p><p>DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han agreed that Singapore and China should continue to deepen cooperation in areas such as finance, smart cities, public health and epidemic response, human resource and talent development, social governance, nature conservation, education and cultural and tourism exchanges.</p><p>DPM Heng reiterated the importance of restoring people-to-people links for deepening mutual trust and fostering collaboration. Both sides agreed that they should continue discussions and seek progress on the safe resumption of cross-border travel between Singapore and China, as well as the mutual recognition of digital health certificates.</p><p>Fourteen MOUs and agreements were announced at the JCBC:</p><p>(a) Cooperation Plan on China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative - New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor (CCI ILSTC);</p><p>(b) MOU on Urban Governance, Urban Planning and Management;</p><p>(c) MOU on Knowledge Sharing;</p><p>(d) 9th Executive Programme on Cultural Cooperation (2022-2024);</p><p>(e) MOU on \"Single Window\" Interconnection Consortium Blockchain;</p><p>(f) Joint Paper on pursuing Green and Low-Carbon Development;</p><p>(g) MOU on Cooperation in Competition Law;</p><p>(h) MOU on Nature Conservation;</p><p>(i) MOU on \"Garden City\" Project in the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco City;</p><p>(j) MOU relating to Electronic Certificates for Ships and Seafarers;</p><p>(k) MOU to Support the Establishment of the SIP International Business Cooperation Centre (Singapore);</p><p>(l) Cooperation Agreement to establish the National University of Singapore Guangzhou Research Translation and Innovation Institute;</p><p>(m) MOU to establish an exchange-traded funds (ETF) Product Link; and</p><p>(n) Announcement of collaboration on commodity derivatives.</p><p>DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han jointly unveiled the name of Le Le ( ) - the first Giant Panda cub born in Singapore. The cub was born on 14 August 2021 to Kai Kai and Jia Jia - the pair of Giant Pandas which arrived in Singapore in 2012 as part of a collaboration between Wildlife Reserves Singapore and the China Wildlife Conservation Association on conservation and research.</p><p>22nd SIP JSC Meeting</p><p>The 22nd SIP JSC meeting noted that the SIP was in its third decade of collaboration, and highlighted the importance of continuing to reorient the SIP's pathfinder role in Singapore-China collaboration, taking into account our shared interests. Both sides looked forward to enabling greater two-way cross-border services and investments by supporting Chinese companies' internationalisation efforts and Singapore professional services firms' expansion into China. Both sides noted the scope to deepen biomedical cooperation through the SIP and committed to strengthen people-to-people ties via two-way software exchanges.</p><p>13th SSTEC JSC Meeting</p><p>The 13th SSTEC JSC meeting commended the Tianjin Eco-City (Eco-City) for its continued achievements as a leading demonstration of green and smart development in China. The Eco-City was a pathfinder, setting standards in areas including zero waste management and the use of technology to lower carbon emissions as well as enhance public amenities and services for residents. Both sides would strengthen cooperation, aim higher and elevate the Eco-City's high quality development in support of China's national environmental and development objectives. This would be done, for example, by pushing boundaries to further enhance the integration of nature with the built environment as a \"Garden City\", and nurture community stewardship of the Eco-City's natural environment. The meeting also highlighted the joint efforts by both sides in the replication promotion efforts and sharing the Eco-City's experience with other cities in China and internationally.</p><p>5th CCI JSC Meeting</p><p>The 5th CCI JSC meeting reaffirmed the CCI's role connecting Singapore and Chongqing as mutual hubs in our respective regions, and its complementarity with China's latest development strategies.

China and the US together account for 40% of global emissions. China leads with 27%, over a quarter of the global emissions. This is followed by the US at 13%. The next three are the EU at 8%, India at 7% and Russia at 5%,\" says Ho.</p><p>Since 2005, the EU has cut its emissions by a \"creditable\" 30%, Ho adds, followed by the US with a 12% reduction.</p><p>Meanwhile, China's emissions over the same period grew by over 60%, while India's more than doubled. \"Carbon abatement needs government action now, especially by these top five emitters. Investors and businesses must act too,\" says Ho.</p><p>World's largest carbon market</p><p>In July, China's national carbon trading programme, the emission trading scheme (ETS), went live. Credit Suisse expects this to become the world's largest carbon market, with more than twice the market size of the EU's ETS.</p><p>China's carbon trading volume in 2019 and 2020 comprised less than 1.4% of its total emissions in the same period. David Murphy, Credit Suisse's head of CQi, says: \"The scale of China's carbon market is set to grow rapidly and cover a larger portion of the nation's emissions over the next five to 10 years, thereby opening the door for greater international collaboration on cross-border trading.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, there remains a very significant task ahead for China, says Credit Suisse. Even if China manages to achieve peak emissions by 2030, it will only have a 30-year runway to achieve carbon neutrality. By comparison, many European countries enjoy a longer timeframe than China to achieve their zero-carbon goal.</p><p>Moreover, as China approaches peak emissions, its \"growth at all costs\" strategy will be increasingly called into question.</p><p>Most developed countries are dependent on low-carbon sectors for economic growth. In contrast, China plans to retain its traditional industrial capacity and is unlikely to be able to tap offshoring of manufacturing capacity to ease carbon emission rates - as seen in Europe and the US - as it seeks to reduce its carbon output to transition to a lower-carbon economy.</p><p>Carbon pricing from China's trade destinations will also gnaw at its future growth. For one, Credit Suisse highlights the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).</p><p>The CBAM is an import customs tariff on carbon-intensive production outside of the EU. Exporters with less strict climate policies and higher emission content will pay a carbon price pegged to the EU ETS.</p><p>Here, Credit Suisse believes exporters of steel, aluminum, cement and fertilisers may face material risks.</p><p>At the country level, China and Russia have uniquely high exposure as the largest suppliers of iron and steel and aluminum. China produces over 1,050 million tonnes of steel, 2,300 million tonnes of cement, 35 million tonnes of aluminium, and 7 million tonnes of copper annually, contributing to 58%, 57%, 57% and 39% of global production respectively.</p><p>\"The vast production of energy-intensive commodities creates an enormous demand for energy consumption and unfortunately generates huge amounts of carbon dioxide as well,\" says Edmond Huang, Credit Suisse's head of China and Hong Kong securities research.</p><p>If the cost of CBAM is passed through, steel and aluminum prices per tonne will increase by 8% and 21% respectively against EU spot prices. Chinese steel would be 10%-11% more expensive in 2026, which would accelerate a decarbonisation in Chinese steel, adds Credit Suisse.</p><p>Phineas Glover, head of ESG research for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse, points to the CBAM as a \"polluter's dilemma\". \"It serves to both enforce the so-called polluter pays principle, and, through the power of market access, overcome what has been the prisoner's dilemma of global climate policy.\"</p><p>\"However, it will also create big investment opportunities in China,\" adds Glover. \"In particular, we expect to see an accelerated deployment of renewables and, as carbon prices increase, an increase in coal-to-gas switching within industrials. We also foresee an increase in electric arc furnace-made steel, hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) investment.\"</p><p>Global green trends</p><p>According to Credit Suisse, China is well-positioned to achieve technology independence and leadership in key sectors, given its dominance in the solar, wind, EV and battery supply chains.</p><p>Chinese suppliers now control over 80% of the effective capacity in most of the segments across the global solar supply chain, while Chinese wind turbine makers had 45% of the global market share in 2019.</p><p>According to industry data and CQi's estimates, Chinese companies accounted for 42.2% of EV sales and 48.3% of EV battery installation globally last year.</p><p>\"While these large shares of the global market may trend down over time with other countries building their own capacities to reduce reliance on China, the very strong global demand will likely see China's exports of green products continue to grow over the next few decades,\" says Credit Suisse.</p><p>Within the transportation sector, Credit Suisse foresees new energy vehicles (NEVs) and renewable energy as the major beneficiaries of the replacement of traditional internal combustion engine cars and fossil fuels.</p><p>The Chinese government uses the term NEV to designate plug-in electric vehicles eligible for public subsidies. These include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).</p><p>Compared to traditional cars, NEVs are expected to cut CO2 emissions by 35% during their lifecycle. China is already the world's largest NEV market with a 38% global market share and the highest NEV sales volume.</p><p>The auto industry is strategic to China's economy, with its 4% GDP contribution and 10% employment contribution.</p><p>Huang thinks the Chinese government has shown strong policy support for the adoption of NEVs. \"Looking ahead, Credit Suisse forecasts a 25% 10-year CAGR in China's NEV volume and a 43% NEV penetration rate by 2030. The NEV market is expected to create a level playing field for Chinese auto companies to fulfil a more prominent role in the global auto industry.\"</p><p>As ambitious as the world's green plans may be, the lingering economic effects of the pandemic are likely to weigh down on China's near-term progress, says Credit Suisse. \"The lagging vaccination progress in much of the developing world and the risk of new virus variants have cast a shadow over universal normalisation in the global supply chain and business activity.\"</p><p>As a result, the Chinese government may have to take a more cautious approach in pushing high-carbon industries to cut production this year and in 2022, says Credit Suisse.</p><p>\"While China's path to carbon neutrality is not without challenges, Credit Suisse believes that there will continue to be opportunities and benefits in paying close attention to China's economy as the nation strengthens its position as a leading innovator, global climate change collaborator and strong investor.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Singapore", "instances": ["To achieve net-zero emissions by 2060, Credit Suisse estimates China will need to invest about RMB100-130 trillion ($21. 1-27.

A very good morning to our distinguished speakers and Roundtable panellists, and to all the viewers who have joined us via Zoom this morning. I am excited today to be here to deliver the keynote speech at the 36th ASEAN Roundtable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. This year's theme is Braving the Storms: ASEAN in Crisis Mode. Indeed, it has been a difficult time for us all, with COVID-19 posing new and unforeseen challenges to countries all over the world. The ASEAN region is no exception, as we grapple with not just the current global public health crisis, but also with fundamental shifts in the international order and our place in it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Current Geopolitical Developments</p><p>3. In the past few years, we've seen rapid shifts in the global geopolitical landscape, with new partnerships formed, old alliances renewed, and increased concerns of greater polarization.</p><p>4. Relations between the US and China have become tense, with reverberations across the region. Amidst the uncertainty, there has been an increased global focus on the Asia-Pacific region, including ASEAN. Notwithstanding these tensions, in recent years, ASEAN's volume of trade flows with both the US and China have increased. Amidst the pandemic, China and the US were ASEAN's largest and second-largest trading partners in 2020, with two-way merchandise trade growing by 1.8% and 4.6% respectively. The US and China are also stepping up their engagements with the region, with both US and Chinese senior officials visiting ASEAN countries recently and seeking to strengthen cooperation in economic, digital, public health and other spheres. ASEAN has constructive and positive relationships with the US, China and other partners. We will always welcome engagement with all stakeholders and hope that our partners will continue to contribute constructively to the peace and stability of the region and complement the existing ASEAN-centric regional architecture.</p><p>5. As we continue to face an uncertain international geopolitical environment and an evolving geopolitical landscape with the emergence of new arrangements, ASEAN Centrality and unity continues to be key, to safeguard our autonomy and ability to make decisions in our best interests. ASEAN Member States must work together to maintain ASEAN Centrality and unity in the region and preserve our autonomy to collaborate with our partners outside ASEAN.</p><p>ASEAN Strategies for Post-Pandemic Recovery</p><p>6. Amidst the dynamically changing geopolitical backdrop, regional cooperation is critical to address one of ASEAN's most pressing concerns, which is the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The immediate public health impact of the disease and the economic implications continue to unfold and affect our people and economies.</p><p>7. ASEAN has banded together to promote recovery and emerge stronger from the pandemic. Last year, we launched the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, which focuses the region's post-pandemic recovery efforts on five broad areas of enhancing public health, human security, regional economic integration, inclusive digital transformation and sustainability. ASEAN's partners have also expressed commitment to supporting its implementation and bolstering regional post-pandemic recovery.</p><p>8. To cite another example of our cooperation, at the height of the pandemic last year, ASEAN and its FTA partners signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP. The RCEP is the world's largest FTA, comprising 30% of global GDP and a third of the world's population. Singapore and our RCEP Partners are working towards the entry into force of RCEP by early 2022. When implemented, it will strengthen ASEAN's economic ties with the broader region. These efforts speak to the importance of working together for post-pandemic recovery through further integration of our economies.</p><p>Long-term economic transformation</p><p>9. However, ASEAN is also looking beyond crisis mode towards longer-term resilience. Beyond the short-term disruptions, ASEAN is also actively seeking to harness the benefits from global megatrends. Let me name three.</p><p>10. First, digitalisation has increased exponentially during the pandemic. There were 40 million new Internet users last year, resulting in 70% of the region's population now being online. [1] The use of e-commerce has become a key channel for businesses to seek new growth opportunities and for consumers to better access digital services. The industry is set to grow further. By 2025, e-commerce in the region is expected to expand by 23% to US$172 billion from US$62 billion in 2020.[2] It will be important for ASEAN to leverage this momentum to promote an equitable and inclusive economic recovery.</p><p>11. To that end, the ASEAN Economic Ministers recently adopted the Bandar Seri Begawan Roadmap[3] on digital transformation, which highlights key needle-moving initiatives towards a single digital economy in ASEAN. As part of this Roadmap, ASEAN has agreed to start negotiations on an ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement by 2025. This will promote the seamless and secure flow of goods, services and data in the region, underpinned by enabling rules, regulations, infrastructure and talent.</p><p>12. Second, the pandemic has accelerated long-term shifts in supply chains. Businesses are increasingly pursuing resilience in supply chains, on top of efficiency considerations. In a region closely connected by value chains, ASEAN is striving to strengthen our value proposition as a regional production and manufacturing hub. We are enhancing efforts to promote trade facilitation within the region, including by addressing non-tariff measures and expanding the ASEAN Single Window through link-ups with our FTA partners.</p><p>13. Third, ASEAN is embarking on the transition towards a green recovery. We recently finalised the Framework for Circular Economy for the ASEAN Economic Community, which outlines the region's strategic commitment to sustainable development. The Framework will galvanise the implementation of concrete initiatives towards sustainable and inclusive growth for our people, economies and societies. One such initiative is the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility[4], or the ACGF, which provides loans and technical assistance for green, bankable infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia. In March 2021, ACGF, with financing support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Green Climate Fund (GCF), launched the Green Recovery Programme. The Programme will support over 20 green infrastructure projects worth more than US$4 billion across Southeast Asia, and is expected to create 340,000 green jobs in key sectors such as sustainable transport, renewable energy and low-carbon agriculture over a 30-year period.</p><p>14. These initiatives will help ASEAN emerge stronger and greener, and entrench ASEAN's position in the international economy in the 21st century. We look forward to continuing to work with our ASEAN counterparts, as well as with our partners from around the world.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>15. Over the next two days, a variety of issues and challenges that affect ASEAN as a region and institution will be discussed by leading scholars and commentators. I hope that the viewers will enjoy listening to the discussions and that you will find them interesting and enriching.</p><p>16.

The government may consider allocating S$10 million to S$20 million over the next three years for co-funding research, setting standards and establishing a complementary set of policy and market-based instruments to support this net-zero timeline.\"</p><p>Incentivising private finance</p><p> Equally important in the battle against climate change is the role that private finance can and will play - and tax policies can do much in directing financing to the desired avenues.</p><p> \"When evaluating the risks and rewards of potential investments, businesses will take into account, among other things, the financial payoff including the impact of any available fiscal schemes. Hence, tax policy can send a strong signal to businesses so that they adopt measures that are consistent with the nation's sustainability goals,\" Woo says.</p><p> \"It can also help correct certain inefficiencies in resource allocation by the market, for example, under-investment in research and development. Tax incentives such as additional capital allowances or additional tax deductions could be used to encourage the growth of a sustainability-centred business ecosystem in Singapore.\"</p><p> Woo adds that the measures could be along the lines of: grants or double tax deductions to encourage companies, especially SMEs, to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint; tax deductions for contributions to funds or projects set up by companies to reduce carbon emissions or wastage; and super tax deductions for the cost of acquiring carbon credits issued by such funds or projects should also encourage the voluntary use of such carbon credits as a means to offset their carbon footprint.</p><p> Tan agrees, detailing a host of other measures, such as additional tax depreciation for investment in more energy-efficient machinery, tax incentives for renewable power generation companies, or reduced taxes on interest payments made on loans to fund renewable power generation or the purchase of energy efficient machinery.</p><p> Sanganeria says governments have to find ways to incentivise investors - and examples include incentives for financial institutions to encourage more green lending, such as reduced tax rates on income from loans used for the development of green properties, or tax exemptions for investors on income earned from bonds where the funds are used for green investments.</p><p> \"Property owners could also be incentivised to make their buildings more energy efficient through offering enhanced tax deductions, or a partial tax exemption on gains from green property sales,\" he says.</p><p> Toh points out that it would also be worthwhile for governments to review their existing incentive schemes - and enhance them by incorporating certain green parameters. \"In Singapore, for example, existing tax incentives such as the Development and Expansion Incentive typically have capital investment expenditure requirements. A qualitative green element could be included that requires corporations to undertake green projects, commit to a certain carbon emissions level or source materials from sustainable sources to minimise the carbon footprint of their supply chains.\"</p><p> On other measures, Yeo says he hopes the Singapore government can consider setting aside a sum over the next three years to co-fund pilot programmes around packaging waste reduction, targeting the F&amp;B (food and beverage) and e-commerce sectors. \"The focus areas can be to incentivise first-movers to reduce packaging; collect packaging for reuse or recycling; conduct consumer or industry outreach on packaging 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle); encourage use of recycled content in packaging material; and improve recyclability of packaging.\"</p><p> In this vein, Addy also says that he hopes to see an increased prevalence of plastic taxes, aimed at both businesses and consumers, to encourage a switch to renewable options.</p><p> But, regardless of the fiscal scheme, Toh says, there should always be appropriate measures to monitor the progress of projects for accountability of the funds disbursed.</p><p> Woo concludes: \"Tax policy has a role to play to influence behaviours and catalyse actions. It is hoped that in the continuing debate on the design of a fit-for-purpose international tax system, due recognition can be given to the positive role of tax policy in promoting environmentally responsible sustainable growth.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": []}]
