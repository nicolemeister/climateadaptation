While this may be true for some risks, such as broader economic transition risks, it is clear from repeated headlines that extreme weather events pose an unparallelled risk to businesses worldwide today -- both in terms of financial cost and operational resilience. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> With disasters escalating in frequency and severity, the impact on Singapore businesses and their operations and supply chains around the region continues to grow exponentially. This impact is expected only to grow if net-zero targets are missed and higher levels of carbon are emitted into the atmosphere, further modifying global weather patterns.</p><p> For organisations to not just survive but also remain competitive in the face of these changes, understanding and preparing for climate risks must become an integral part of business strategy. </p><p> Rising costs of a changing climate The statistics speak volumes. According to Nature, climate change could cost the global economy as much as US$24.7 trillion annually by 2060. For context, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods and heatwaves have already accrued over US$2.8 trillion in costs since the early 2000s. These risks are no longer hypothetical; they are here, and they are costing businesses millions -- if not billions -- each year. </p><p> The question isn't whether climate risks will affect Singapore companies, but how extensively. This new landscape requires businesses to rethink resilience and prepare for both short and long-term challenges ahead. </p><p> Understanding climate risks Climate risks fall under two primary categories: physical risks and transition risks. Both demand a firm grasp to effectively plan, adapt and safeguard operational continuity. </p><p> Physical risks: Physical risks -- think floods, hurricanes, or heatwaves -- can disrupt supply chains, damage property, and increase operating costs. These events aren't isolated to specific industries; though agriculture, leisure, construction, and retail are particularly vulnerable, no sector is immune. Businesses must evaluate potential vulnerabilities, whether they stem from damaged infrastructure or unexpected supply chain bottlenecks. </p><p> For example, when flooding disrupts warehouses in one region, it can cascade across multiple points in manufacturing or distribution networks, creating financial blowback that compounds over time, threatening revenue and the bottom line. </p><p>Singapore itself is also not immune, facing significant physical risk through more extreme rainfall and potential sea level rises -- about 30 per cent of the island nation is less than five metres above sea level.</p><p> Carbon emitted to date has already exacerbated physical risks today through modification of global weather patterns, and these effects are not expected to reverse even if the global economy achieves net-zero by its stated targets.</p><p> Transition risks: The movement towards a low-carbon economy brings its own set of challenges known as transition risks. These can include shifting consumer preferences, legislation forcing greener operations, and reputational pressures. Transition risks are multifaceted, encompassing: </p><p> The need for modelling climate risks  To act strategically against these risks, climate risk modelling has become non-negotiable. Forward-looking models aren't just about compliance; they provide businesses with critical, actionable insights to safeguard and optimise operations for years to come. By assessing risks under varying future warming scenarios, decision-makers can proactively adapt strategies instead of scrambling reactively in the wake of disaster. </p><p> Effective modelling can help businesses answer essential questions:</p><p> Retailers, for example, are already taking preemptive action -- designing flood-resistant buildings, replacing vulnerable materials such as sheet roofing, geographically diversifying their supply chain, or relocating operations altogether. Small adjustments today could prevent massive disruptions tomorrow. </p><p> Additionally, it's important to note that regulators from jurisdictions including Singapore, the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, and the US state of California are shifting from voluntary recommendations to mandatory disclosure requirements, starting as early as 2025. These rules ask businesses to report both risks and opportunities associated with climate change, in line with frameworks developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) -- pushing organisations to assess impact not only defensively but also with an eye towards growth. </p><p> Opportunities beyond risk management While climate risks dominate headlines, the flip side is often overlooked. Addressing these risks provides fertile ground for innovation, operational efficiencies, and brand differentiation. Many organisations are already capitalising on green opportunities by investing in renewable energy, developing sustainable products, and streamlining resource usage. </p><p> From adopting carbon-neutral logistics to innovating in areas such as carbon capture and electric technology, these strategies don't just limit exposure -- they create new competitive advantages. By integrating sustainability into corporate practices, businesses can build stronger relationships with consumers, investors, and employees alike. </p><p> Climate change presents looming challenges, but it also provides an unprecedented moment for leadership in Singapore -- something the Singapore government and many businesses here have taken up the mantle on already. Businesses that recognise this urgency, model accurately their exposure, and adopt forward-looking strategies will not only outpace competitors but also help lead industries toward a more sustainable future. </p><p> The time for complacency has passed.

Beyond showing a green upside to projects, they must also make a compelling business case for them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The central challenge for today's CSO is how to deliver on sustainability goals profitably while balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders. This means making the most of recent financial and technological innovations. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This new pressure is a key finding of CBRE's 2025 Asia Pacific Real Estate Chief Sustainability Officer Survey. We interviewed executives from nearly two dozen corporates in Asia-Pacific -- most notably Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore and mainland China -- divided equally between landlords and investors in commercial real estate. </p><p> The survey reveals a maturing landscape: Nearly 90 per cent of these companies have a dedicated sustainability function -- up 10 per cent in two years -- and 70 per cent of their CSOs are full-time. When asked to identify their most pressing challenges, these leaders highlighted three issues that have grown sharply in importance since 2024. </p><p> First, the CSOs pointed to the complexity of the current policy and business environment.</p><p> Second, they cited the difficulty of establishing clear financial benefits of meeting their sustainability goals, and the typically lengthy payback periods for sustainability investments. </p><p> Finally, CSOs find that they increasingly must do more with less. More than 60 per cent said they had no plans to expand their sustainability teams, despite heightened operational challenges.  </p><p> One reason for this corporate caution is a regional step change. Sustainable buildings are no longer the exception in Asia-Pacific, they are becoming the norm. </p><p> CBRE research indicates that the share of green-certified Asia-Pacific office floorspace crossed the 50 per cent threshold in 2024. Our 2025 survey reflects this momentum: Almost two-thirds of respondents said that by 2028, at least 80 per cent of their portfolio will consist of green-certified buildings. </p><p> While this is good news for sustainability, it also means that the scope for a green premium is fading. Tenants now expect sustainability features and performance as a standard offering, not an extra for which they will pay higher rent. </p><p> The exception is in less mature Asia-Pacific markets, where the supply of green buildings is tighter and occupiers remain willing to pay more for a building that aligns with their sustainability goals. </p><p> This leaves CSOs in the position of needing to meet tenant expectations for green buildings -- 60 per cent reported pressure from tenants in this regard -- while also satisfying internal stakeholders to justify sustainability investments in financial terms, as opposed to treating sustainability as an end in itself. </p><p> Several CSOs said they needed to demonstrate a return on investment to win approval for projects.</p><p> How, then, should CSOs go about this? The path forward involves shifting the focus from purely environmental benefits to the underlying business case and asset resilience.</p><p> The first step is to recognise that green is the new normal. The sustainability of commercial buildings in Asia-Pacific is quickly transitioning from a \"nice to have\" to a \"must have\" -- an essential component of the asset's value. </p><p> Additionally, assessing the risk of assets becoming stranded as a result not only of changing tenant expectations but also regulatory change, must be a core part of the calculus for CSOs in establishing the business case for sustainability investments. </p><p> Next, while sustainability tends to focus on carbon emissions, energy savings and cost savings usually go hand in hand. Sustainable building materials offer an example -- for instance, the use of abundant bamboo instead of timber in China. Energy dashboards that optimise lighting as well as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems around building footfall reduce both costs and emissions. </p><p> Energy retrofits that limit energy waste can have the same impact, although some CSOs noted government incentives are often needed to make these projects viable. </p><p> On the positive side, the financial sector also offers additional help. Energy upgrades and new green construction are often eligible for green finance. Sustainability-linked loans are the most common instrument, which 77 per cent of survey respondents reported using, alongside green loans, green bonds and other similar instruments. Concessional financing can substantially improve the business case for sustainability projects. </p><p> Lastly, as climate change poses a direct physical threat to buildings, investing in building resilience is a core part of protecting an asset's long-term value. Taking an integrated approach that prioritises resilience alongside other factors makes sense at a time when under-insurance against climate risks is a growing challenge. </p><p> Overall, CSOs can build a stronger business case by focusing on projects that strengthen an asset's green credentials while simultaneously lowering its energy costs and bolstering its climate resilience. This approach then becomes as much about the bottom line as it is about cutting carbon emissions.  </p><p> Ultimately, real estate leaders who integrate sustainability with profitability will set the pace for the region's future.</p><p> The writer is head of research for Asia-Pacific at CBRE</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Lastly, as climate change poses a direct physical threat to buildings, investing in building resilience is a core part of protecting an asset's long-term value.

Good afternoon to all of you. It is my pleasure to join you today at this SEAPAW Ecosperity event.</p><p>Impact of climate change on Southeast Asia</p><p>2. It is fitting that this event is called \"Water at the Core: Accelerating Climate Adaptation in Southeast Asia\", as climate change impacts are becoming more apparent worldwide in the form of more extreme weather events, such as droughts and storms. Although the world has made some progress in climate mitigation since the Paris Agreement, efforts remain insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. If global temperature rise overshoots this and reaches 2 degree Celsius, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that 50% more of the world's population would live under water stress.</p><p>3. Water stress arises from the extremes of too little and too much water. Too little water, and many of Southeast Asia's economic activities, such as agriculture and tourism which depend on water, will be severely affected. Too much water, and this could lead to sea level rise and flooding, threatening our people given our geography comprising long coastlines, low-lying islands, and dense urban centres.</p><p>Singapore Water Story</p><p>4. These are among the starkest environmental challenges facing Singapore. As a small island city-state with limited natural catchment, Singapore is amongst the most water stressed in the world. Our Water Story demonstrated that acknowledging our vulnerabilities can spur us to overcome them by leveraging technologies to diversify our water sources. Singapore began studying the feasibility of reclaimed water since the 1970s, and today NEWater has become one of our weather-resilient sources in Singapore's \"Four National Taps\" strategy.</p><p>5. At the same time, being situated in the tropics also results in the problem of too much water within a short span of time. In the 1960s and 1970s, Singapore faced frequent and widespread flooding during the monsoon season. While Singapore has invested in expanding our drainage infrastructure, it is not feasible to expand our drains to cater for every extreme rainfall event. We are thus enhancing community resilience by supporting our community to better prepare for and respond to flood incidents, such as by issuing early warnings of potential flood. The next chapter of flood resilience will be coastal protection to deal with rising sea levels. Many of you would have heard about initiatives such as our Long Island, which will not only protect our low-lying east coast from sea level rise, but also create new land for future opportunities.</p><p>Investing in Climate Resilience</p><p>6. Our experience has shown us that it is important to understand our risks clearly, start early and invest conscientiously to strengthen our climate resilience. However, there is serious underinvestment worldwide. According to a report by the Climate Policy Initiative, global investments in climate adaptation and resilience initiatives made up only 5% of total annual climate finance and 20-30% of projected annual climate adaptation financing needs. I would like to touch on two areas where there are opportunities to do better.</p><p>7. First, the private sector. We need to increase the private sector's awareness of physical climate risks and the cost-of-inaction. Understanding climate risks is key to business strategy and future-proofing your business. When it comes to addressing climate risks, prevention is better than cure. A small investment in climate resilience today can help to address broader risks, and mitigate potentially larger future losses. There are many ways to help companies tackle climate risks. First, we need better climate projections, such as the findings from Singapore's 3rd National Climate Change Study (V3), which we completed last year. V3 provides the highest resolution of climate projections over Southeast Asia for parameters such as rainfall and temperature. Through our recently launched V3 Data Sharing Portal, companies can tap on V3 climate projections to understand the climate risks in their supply chains under future conditions. Next, climate disclosure frameworks can encourage companies to pay closer attention to their climate risks across geographies and supply chains. Beginning Financial Year (FY) 2025, there will be a move towards mandatory climate-related disclosures for listed companies and large non-listed companies in Singapore. These disclosures will be aligned with the framework developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This will raise companies' awareness and spur them to take a more informed view of addressing climate risks. I encourage companies to leverage climate projections such as V3 for your climate risk assessment, and to undertake climate disclosure seriously.</p><p>8. With climate disclosure, the risks become more apparent, and companies would seek to reduce their climate exposure. One way would be to relocate their operations to another place with less climate risk. A more beneficial approach would be for companies to invest in where they operate, increasing the community's climate resilience while also strengthening their supply chain resilience. For example, Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) is Singaporean wafer fabrication company who has been recycling water at an average of 67%, above the industry average of 45%. This improves onsite water efficiency and decreases water consumption, leading to a more water-resilient supply chain, especially during the dry months of the year. I would like to challenge companies to explore how you can do likewise for your operations throughout Southeast Asia.</p><p>9. The second area we can focus on is to enhance adaptation finance. We can do so by making climate adaptation projects more bankable through blended finance, and also by building capability in climate finance.</p><p>10. Collectively, we should explore how to support blended finance in climate adaptation, so that we can create more bankable projects that crowd in private capital to plug the gap in adaptation financing. This is important as only about 2% of adaptation finance comes from private and philanthropic sectors. Blended finance can make adaptation projects more bankable through a combination of concessional capital, technical assistance and de-risking mechanisms. Concessional capital could comprise grants or guarantees, with technical assistance covering areas such as project development to strengthen investor confidence and project bankability. We need to reduce the project risks sufficiently to attract private commercial capital.</p><p>11. Putting these altogether, we should also recognise the critical role that local partners and NGOs like SEAPAW play. SEAPAW builds on the Singapore International Foundation (SIF)'s track record over the past 34 years, whose projects have created community benefits in more than 28 countries. Through SEAPAW's network of partners, it can localise global solutions and partner them with the right financing options which are suited to the needs of communities. One example is SEAPAW's project in Sarawak, Malaysia, which aims to bring clean water to rural communities. The project uses advancements in membrane technology in the water purification process to enhance water resilience and address the issue of clean water supply. At the same time, it is powered sustainably by a renewable energy source. Once the pilot is successful and partnered with the right financing, it can be scaled up to benefit many more communities within Southeast Asia. This multi-stakeholder approach taken by SEAPAW allows them to harness the strengths from across the public, private and philanthropic sectors, and bring them to bear in addressing the climate challenges we face in our region.</p><p>Closing</p><p>12. In closing, similar to how Singapore made early investments in NEWater, which is now a key pillar for our water resilience, we need to invest now for the future for our climate resilience. We need to act decisively today for the long-term, by increasing the knowledge on risks and encouraging climate adaptation finance. I encourage organisations and individuals across sectors to explore how you can contribute to this collective effort. Whether through funding, innovation, or community support, do join SEAPAW in accelerating Southeast Asia's climate resilience.</p><p>[Category: Water Utilities, Utilities, Partnerships and Alliances, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["The next chapter of flood resilience will be coastal protection to deal with rising sea levels.

Buildings account for over 20 percent of Singapore's carbon emissions, with air-conditioning being a key contributor to building energy consumption. Overcooling not only increases electricity usage but also accelerates climate change and exacerbates the urban heat island effect. This creates a vicious feedback cycle: hotter cities demand more cooling, which generates more emissions and heat, further raising ambient temperatures. This is not sustainable.</p><p>Science-Backed Approach to Sustainable Cooling</p><p>3. A growing body of research affirms the benefits of setting air-conditioning temperatures optimally. A study in partnership with Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Centre for Environmental Sustainability (CfES) showed energy savings of up to 12 percent for each degree raised in air-conditioning temperature from 23C to 25C in offices, with no reported increase in occupant discomfort. Additional energy savings can be achieved when air-conditioning temperatures are set above 25C. Hybrid cooling solutions - which set air-conditioning at a higher temperature complemented with secondary cooling measures such as fans - can bring even greater energy savings.</p><p>4.

This prevailing modus operandi is based on the premise of US exceptionalism -- characterised in recent years by the strengthening of the US dollar, US equity markets and investment assets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But of late, the Trump administration's approach towards tariffs, geopolitics and macro-prudential policies has raised questions about the risk premium of investing in US-based and USD-denominated assets. USD weakness -- year to date the USD Index (DXY) has dropped 9.5 per cent -- has eroded overall returns when translated into investors' home currencies, in spite of underlying bullish stock market conditions. The S&amp;P 500 Index has forged new highs. </p><p> Besides prompting a rethink about the vulnerability of outsized allocation to USD-based investments, the recent volatility has also raised questions among investors and asset allocators (including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurers and high-net-worth investors) about what constitutes safe-haven assets in the long run. </p><p> At Bank of Singapore, we highlighted in our 2025 Supertrends report that a fragmented world order of geopolitical rivalry, rising trade barriers, hostility to immigration and widening populism is rapidly replacing the US-led order of free markets, free trade and globalisation that prevailed after the end of the Cold War. Without multilateralism and globalisation as basic tenets, coalitions and alliances will be founded instead on common interests and agenda. </p><p> Over the next decade, heightened uncertainty will result in volatility in inflationary expectations, interest rates, currencies, and strengthen the search for safe-haven assets. All around the world, fiscal burdens will rise as national security demands higher defence spending; changing demographics call for social expenditure; and infrastructure spending is required for energy security and climate resilience.</p><p> In our view, a \"robust asset allocation\" approach is suited for building long-term portfolios. This analytical optimisation architecture explicitly acknowledges the inherent uncertainty of market inputs (including risk, expected returns and correlation) across a range of outcomes, making for more resilient portfolios that align with investors' long-term goals.</p><p> To reduce portfolio concentration in USD assets, investors can consider geographical diversification to include Europe, Asia and emerging markets, as well as gold and alternative asset classes like private markets. Another viable strategy is to adjust overall portfolio currency exposures to free-floating alternatives such as euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc and Japanese yen, as well as allocations into the SGD.</p><p> Here are some reasons that support an allocation into SGD assets.</p><p> SGD stabilityAs a small open economy with a sizeable financial centre, Singapore's currency exhibits traits of a long-term store of value, with parallels drawn to the Swiss franc. Following independence in 1965, Singapore's currency was first pegged against the GBP and the USD, at around S$3 per USD. When the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was dissolved in the 1970s, the SGD began to strengthen considerably to as high as S$1.20 against the USD in 2011.</p><p> It currently trades at S$1.28, which is still far above levels in the1960s. As the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) targets the SGD rather than interest rates to manage inflation, the currency is managed against a basket of currencies of Singapore's main trading partners to maintain price stability. </p><p> In the latest July monetary policy review, the MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band, with no change to its width and the level at which it is centred. The central bank assessed the monetary policy settings to be consistent with ensuring medium-term price stability based on the prevailing growth and inflation outlook. It said: \"MAS is well-positioned to respond to the evolving outlook, having already eased monetary policy in January and April this year.\"</p><p> Economic fundamentals: adaptability and resilienceStagflationary risks have risen with the harsh tariffs the US has levied on dozens of countries, including Mexico (25 per cent), Canada (35 per cent), Switzerland (39 per cent) and India (25 per cent plus 25 per cent secondary tariff). </p><p>Yale Budget Lab estimates the US average tariff rate now stands at 18.3 per cent, the highest since 1934. Singapore's exports to the US are subject to baseline tariffs of 10 per cent, but the country is externally exposed to the overall global economic impact of the tariff regime. </p><p> The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) upgraded its full-year growth forecast range on Tuesday (Aug 12) to a range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent, from 0 to 2 per cent before.</p><p> While Singapore's relative economic stability stands out amid global geopolitical and economic uncertainties, the government proactively convened the Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong to support businesses and jobs, in anticipation of the grave challenges ahead.</p><p>Singapore's past success was due to carefully planned developments and investments to transform from a manufacturing hub in the 1960s to 1970s, to become an advanced digital nation today. Singapore sits at the confluence of capital markets -- supported by intra-Asia growth, a wealth management hub benefitting from rising affluence and long-term structural trends of innovation and sustainability.</p><p> Fresh impetus for Singapore equitiesThe recent re-rating of the Singapore equity market has been attributed to foreign investor inflows, earnings resilience of listed companies and government measures to boost the local bourse.</p><p> The MAS and the Financial Sector Development Fund announced a S$5 billion Equity Market Development Programme to earmark investment into locally-listed equities to increase the market's breadth beyond large-cap stocks. </p><p> Equity market reform is underway with programmes that focus on increased shareholder engagement, market liquidity for retail and institutional investors, as well as cross-border partnerships, as announced by the Equities Market Review Group. </p><p> In our overall tactical asset allocation, we remain overweight in Singapore equities within Asia ex-Japan, on the back of this ongoing review, attractive capital return programmes and healthy fundamentals in the large-cap space. </p><p> Quality small- and mid-caps with defensive cashflow profile and strong growth trajectories will also come into increasing investor focus. </p><p> Defensive fund flows into Singapore and our expectation of medium-term SGD strength support the case for exposure to Singapore equities. </p><p> For yield-seeking investors, Singapore listed companies have consistently offered steady growth in dividend income, with average dividend yield of 5 per cent (based on FSSTI index stocks), according to Bank of Singapore CIO Investment Institute estimates.</p><p> Investment themes for the Singapore equity market include the banking sector which is committed to overall shareholder returns; industrials that benefit from structural tailwinds; communications services with regional footprint; and selective mid-cap stocks backed by fundamentals and valuations, despite the recent run-up.</p><p>  In general, stock selection is key as a stronger SGD can be a double-edged sword for export-oriented companies or those with globally-sourced income. </p><p> For wealth management portfolios focused on long-term growth and stability, allocation to SGD-denominated assets could be an important investment decision, as a part of globally diversified multi-asset portfolios amid the shifts in international geo-economics.</p><p> The writer is global chief investment officer, Bank of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Without multilateralism and globalisation as basic tenets, coalitions and alliances will be founded instead on common interests and agenda.

Economic setbacks followed: oil shocks in 1975 and 1979, and a recession in 1985 due to eroded competitiveness.</p><p>Singapore responded decisively, cutting wages and rebounding swiftly. A similar resilience was seen during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, and the global financial crisis a decade later.</p><p> Structural reforms in the 2000s diversified the economy into financial and business services, high-tech manufacturing and the biomedical industry.</p><p> Despite recent shocks -- including economic disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, higher global inflation and interest rates triggered by the war in Ukraine, protectionist trade policies and heightened US-China tensions -- Singapore has responded by skilfully leveraging its fiscal buffers to turn adversity into opportunity.</p><p> Embracing technological transformationSingapore now enters a critical phase of economic restructuring, driven by rapid advances in digitalisation and artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p> The advent of generative AI, process automation and robotics presents a powerful opportunity to boost productivity and efficiency amid rising costs, a tight labour market and an ageing population.</p><p> However, it also poses risks of widespread disruption to employment -- particularly in middle-skill, routine and data-intensive jobs across manufacturing, finance, law, healthcare and transport. New entrants to the workforce will struggle to find employment in traditional sectors. This shift demands a deliberate and inclusive national response.</p><p> To maintain global competitiveness, the government must support both startups and incumbent enterprises in adopting emerging technologies and reshaping business models.</p><p> Government agencies such as Enterprise Singapore and the Infocomm Media Development Authority should enhance funding and advisory services that help businesses embrace and pivot to digital and AI-augmented operations. Regulatory sandboxes and public-private test beds can help scale innovation while managing risk.</p><p> At the same time, Singapore must proactively upskill its workforce. SkillsFuture must evolve into a dynamic, AI-enabled platform that offers real-time, individualised reskilling paths aligned with fast-changing job market needs.</p><p> Workforce Singapore and tripartite partners should coordinate to deliver stackable skill credentials, apprenticeship programmes and career conversion programmes that offer portable skills across sectors.</p><p> Protecting displaced workers and ensuring that young graduates have meaningful pathways into the new economy are essential for inclusive growth.</p><p> Leveraging green growth as a strategic advantageThe global climate change agenda is not just a moral imperative, but a strategic opportunity for Singapore to lead in green growth.</p><p> Far from being a compliance exercise, the green transition is a source of innovation, investment and long-term competitiveness. As countries impose carbon pricing, border adjustment taxes, and stricter environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates, early movers such as Singapore can gain significant strategic advantages.</p><p>Singapore should aim to be the regional hub for carbon services, including carbon credit trading, emissions verification, and green finance.</p><p> The Singapore Exchange and Monetary Authority of Singapore have been proactive in developing the regulatory framework and promoting sustainable finance, including green bonds, transition finance and ESG disclosure standards. Regional initiatives, such as Project Greenprint, can serve as models for digital infrastructure that enable reliable tracking of carbon emissions and sustainability metrics.</p><p> Domestically, Singapore must accelerate decarbonisation by investing in solar energy, green hydrogen partnerships, energy storage systems and circular economy practices. Buildings and transportation -- two high-emission sectors -- should be fast-tracked for transformation through innovation grants and building codes.</p><p> Climate resilience is equally critical. Defending coastal infrastructure and adapting to extreme weather must remain top priorities. Policymaking should align green objectives with commercial incentives to drive private-sector innovation and participation in the transition.</p><p> Strengthening regional integrationWhile Asia will remain the growth engine for the global economy in the coming years, the global trading system is being challenged by protectionist policies and the global supply chains that are reconfiguring in response. As in the past, the supply chain reconfiguration presents an opportunity for Singapore to play a facilitating and coordinating role.</p><p> Despite rising costs, Singapore remains a premier gateway to Asean and broader Asia. Deepening regional integration can mitigate domestic constraints and broaden opportunities.</p><p>Singapore should champion seamless cross-border data flows, harmonised standards for e-commerce, and interoperable digital payment systems within Asean. Its leadership in the Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement can help shape future-ready trade infrastructure.</p><p> In professional services, Singapore's legal, healthcare and education sectors can be further internationalised by forming partnerships and regulatory bridges with neighbours.</p><p> Additionally, Singapore can leverage its strengths in governance, dispute resolution and project finance to co-lead regional infrastructure development. Initiatives such as the Belt and Road -- if aligned with transparency and sustainability -- offer platforms where Singapore can serve as a neutral, trustworthy intermediary.</p><p> Building an inclusive and resilient societyA high-tech economy must not come at the cost of social cohesion. Technological and structural changes will exacerbate inequalities if left unmanaged.</p><p> As the gig economy grows and traditional employment declines, Singapore must fortify its social compact by revamping and enhancing the social protection framework to reflect new modes of work and emerging vulnerabilities.</p><p> Gig workers, freelancers and part-time workers require access to portable benefits including health insurance, Central Provident Fund-style retirement savings and unemployment support. The rise of platform work necessitates adaptive policy tools -- such as centralised benefits administration and universal access to basic protections -- while preserving flexibility.</p><p> Beyond labour reform, Singapore must address demographic pressures by empowering women, seniors and marginalised communities.</p><p> Family-friendly policies -- including affordable childcare, parental leave and caregiver support -- can enhance workforce participation and help reverse declining fertility. Age-inclusive hiring, flexible working arrangements and senior training programmes are critical to extend productive lifespans. The goal is a society that is not just future-ready, but also future-inclusive.</p><p> Redefining educationSingapore's world-class education system has underpinned its economic success, but the education system must now evolve to keep up with the rapid rise of AI and digital technology, and their impact on the workplace.</p><p> The nature of work is evolving more rapidly than traditional curricula can accommodate. Success in the AI era will depend not only on technical proficiency and knowledge acquisition, but also on agility, creativity and the capacity for lifelong learning.</p><p> Education must become more experiential, interdisciplinary and learner-centric.</p><p> Beyond academic rigour, schools should nurture curiosity, collaboration and ethical decision-making. Students should learn to be more discriminating in their consumption of news and information in the age of social media. Tertiary institutions must partner with industry to co-design programmes that equip students with evolving job market skills needed to operate in an AI-augmented environment.</p><p> Most importantly, learning must continue throughout life. Lifelong learning should be normalised through incentives, digital credentials and recognition frameworks that value all forms of growth.</p><p>Singapore has repeatedly turned challenges and adversity into opportunities and success -- through industrialisation, globalisation, and constantly upgrading and moving up the global value chain.</p><p> The next transformation will be more complex and challenging -- balancing technological efficiency with social equity, environmental sustainability with growth, and geopolitical risk with regional cooperation.</p><p> The nation's small size need not be a weakness, but a strength -- enabling agility, precision and unity of purpose.

From public housing to floodplains, the country's development reflects deliberate choices supported by good design.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This has helped Singapore build a global reputation for turning constraints into possibilities as it transformed limited land into neighbourhoods of thriving communities through urban planning, and used architecture to manage climate risks. This distinct design-led development also earned the city-state a UNESCO Creative City of Design recognition in 2015. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> According to Dawn Lim, Executive Director of the DesignSingapore Council (DSG), the same approach remains key as Singapore enters its next chapter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"In the early days, design was about getting the basics right. We needed to house a nation, build infrastructure, and get people connected to jobs and services. That was foundational design, and it was incredibly effective,\" she says. \"Today, we see Care, Sustainability, and Emerging Technologies as key issues where design can make a deep impact on Singapore's future.\" </p><p> Design that builds better livesA striking example of Singapore's pioneering mindset is Pinnacle@Duxton. Designed by local architectural firm ARC Studio Architecture + Urbanism and launched in 2009, it was Singapore's first 50-storey public housing project. With its sky gardens, walkways, and communal decks, it showed that high-density public housing can be both liveable and appealing as it picked up international awards like the World's Best Housing Development at the World Architecture Festival in 2010.</p><p> Design has likewise reshaped Singapore's spaces for public good. Led by landscape architect and President*s Design Award 2023 Designer of the Year, Leonard Ng, the 53-hectare Jurong Lake Gardens was transformed into an inclusive community garden, restoring biodiversity while enhancing climate resilience in the process. Using a nature-based approach, the park doubles as a floodplain, capturing and slowing stormwater before it reaches the lake. </p><p> In healthcare, hospices such as Oasis @ Outram demonstrates the critical role of design. Lekker Architects and The Care Lab reimagined palliative care through human-centred design of the space and programmes at Oasis @ Outram which bring healing and dignity to the patients. </p><p> Design has also changed how government services are delivered to be more intuitive and accessible. Apps like LifeSG put hundreds of services on a single interface, while ServiceSG centres offer in-person assistance for those who prefer a human touch. </p><p> As Lim points out, these design solutions -- whether in physical spaces or online -- are not just functional, they reflect empathy and an understanding of everyday needs. \"Singapore is designing not just structures, but experiences. Whether it's how someone navigates a hospital, a hawker centre or a digital service, we're thinking more deeply about the human experience,\" she explains. </p><p> Intergenerational design journeySingapore's story would not be complete without the individuals who have shown what local design can achieve. Take Nathan Yong, an industrial designer trained at the former Baharuddin Vocational Institute, Singapore's first design and applied arts school. His storied career includes being the recipient of both the Red Dot Concept Design Award from 2006 to 2007 and the President*s Design Award for 'Designer of the Year' in 2008. He has created furniture for Ligne Roset, Sancal and Herman Miller through his line Nathan Yong Design and further licensed his designs for exports -- proving that local design can be commercially successfully.</p><p> \"I never approached design with the idea of 'local' or 'international'. Human needs are quite universal. If you want your designs to have a future, they need to be relevant globally,\" says Yong. Today, the designer is paying it forward as a Programme Leader at LASALLE College of the Arts, where he mentors and nurtures the next generation of designers in Singapore. </p><p> Other homegrown studios such as STUCK Design, co-founded by a DSG scholar Yong Jieyu, Lee Tze Ming and Donn Koh, are blazing a trail with their standout designs as seen in the award-winning AIR+ Smart Mask, cult-favourite Morning Coffee machine, and its latest AI-powered creativity tool, Hypersketch.</p><p> \"Keeping the human element at the centre isn't just a design principle for us -- it's the reason we design in the first place. STUCK's shift from design consultancy to developing tools like Hypersketch has been about rethinking how creativity can be sparked and shared more widely. It is something that could empower anyone to access and grow their creative potential,\" says STUCK's Koh. \"In our journey, DesignSingapore Council has been a vital partner. The Council nudged us to think bigger. Much of what we've dared to pursue -- and the scale at which we now think -- is rooted in the confidence and stretch that came from working with them.\" </p><p> The global stage Globally, Singapore is positioning itself as a hub for bold design solutions for the world, through platforms like the Singapore Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale, World Expo, and the yearly showcase of Singaporean designers at Milan Design Week. This forward-thinking approach carries significant long-term economic implications. As countries worldwide grapple with complex challenges in an ageing population, healthcare, public services, and sustainability, Singapore is uniquely positioned to offer answers to global challenges in areas such as healthcare, sustainability, and urban living.</p><p> In the latest Future Impact 3: DESIGN NATION at Milan Design Week this year, design stalwart FARM tied up with Changi General Hospital and technology firm Vouse to present a digital twin of an emergency department, which demonstrates design technology at work in healthcare. The event also highlighted emerging talents: Nazurah Rohayat presented an AI-powered textile work blending tradition with technology while E Ian Siew displayed Auxobrace, a James Dyson Award-winning sternal rehabilitation device.</p><p> Equipping talent for the futureThis momentum reflects a deeper national movement: integrating design thinking into education to cultivate future-ready innovators and promoting design literacy in the community. To help groom a pipeline of design talent, DSG has been running workshops for students aged 7 years onwards through its Learning by Design initiative which is open to schools. In addition, it has worked closely with the Design Education Advisory Committee to prepare the next generation for a future where design and technology must go hand in hand.</p><p> Education institutions are already at the forefront of this development. The Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) is investing $50 million to integrate AI into its curriculum; its first cohort of Design and AI graduates has entered the workforce. Meanwhile, Temasek Polytechnic's Design School has launched a generative AI lab to give students a hands-on experience with AI tools. </p><p> It's not just the schools which are adapting. Local SMEs like LionsBot are proving that design-led innovation is a competitive edge. The robotics company clinched top honours at this year's The Business Times and SUTD Design, AI and Tech Awards for its fleet of AI-powered cleaning robots which are designed to be accessible to the elderly and less tech savvy, according to the company's head of design Tan Wei Hua. </p><p> The big pictureDesign has long been integral to Singapore's nation-building story. Looking ahead, Singapore must not only continue to cultivate great designers, it will require a society that thinks and problem-solves like one. The collective mindset must also evolve for Singapore design to gain greater appreciation and depth. </p><p> \"The idea of 'Singapore design' is reliable, functional, well-engineered, but less often seen as soulful or distinct. That's changing slowly. When we start valuing and supporting those things more intentionally, Singapore design can evolve beyond being well made into being deeply felt,\" shares Yong.</p><p> Summing up, Lim says: \"If design helped build this nation, it will shape what we become next -- an even more caring, inclusive and thoughtful society.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["With its sky gardens, walkways, and communal decks, it showed that high-density public housing can be both liveable and appealing as it picked up international awards like the World's Best Housing Development at the World Architecture Festival in 2010.

You see, if countries had tech resumes, Singapore's would stand out to most hiring committees. \"Early adopter of mainframes.\" Check. \"Built a national broadband network before some cities had stable electricity.\" Check. \"One of the most digitalised cities in the world with an internet penetration rate of around 96 per cent and ranked second globally in the IMD Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025.\" Double check.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Yet, as we commemorate this milestone, the tides are turning. Tariffs and geopolitical tensions have stirred up uncertainty and volatility. It is timely then, that on Aug 4, Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong announced the launch of the Economic Strategy Review (ESR), aimed at strengthening Singapore's competitiveness. Five committees will be tasked to do a comprehensive review of Singapore's economic strategy, one of which will look at harnessing technology and innovation, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to drive economic growth and competitiveness. The other committees will focus on areas such as entrepreneurship, human capital, and the impact of restructuring the economy. </p><p> AI, front and centreWhile the key areas are not a surprise, it was interesting to note the prevalence of AI across the board. The rise of AI has led to a structural shift of the Singapore economy, for example. Plans are also under way to develop local AI talent, while attracting global specialists. And of course, there is a need to raise AI fluency and adoption. All this points to the growing importance of AI in Singapore's future economic success. Can it truly have a transformative effect, or are we overhyping AI? </p><p> As we unpack this, let us rewind to 1963. In the early years, Singapore was not exactly Silicon Valley, but installing a mainframe paved the way to laying the digital bricks of a future where technology is second nature. By the 1980s, we had the National Computer Board. And by the 1990s, we were surfing on Singapore One, our very own broadband network. In 2014, the Smart Nation initiative was launched to integrate the internet of things (IoT), data platforms and sensor networks into everyday life -- from lamppost sensors to transport systems. Entrepreneurial environments such as Blk71 and one-north flourished. Singpass lets you renew your passport, pay your taxes, and register your kid's PSLE score faster than you can say \"two-factor authentication\". Hawker stalls accept PayNow. </p><p> And now comes AI. If digitalisation was about making things faster and more convenient, AI is about making them even smarter. But this comes with worries about hallucinations and whether students are over-reliant on it.</p><p> One thing to remember is that tech revolutions do not arrive fully formed. They need time to marinate and mature. AI is no different. While the potential benefits are enormous, we are still in the euphoric stage when every company wants to slap \"AI\" on their pitch books and hope for higher valuations. AI is not a magic wand, but an expensive, energy-hungry tool that could over-promise results if not deployed with discipline and wisdom. To use it well you need strategy and to ask tough questions, such as, \"What is the real business case here? Is the cost justified by the outcome? Is the AI mature enough to handle real-life situation trade-offs'\" </p><p> The good news is that Singapore, naturally, has a game plan. </p><p> The first National AI Strategy (NAIS) was unveiled back in 2019 and NAIS 2.0 in 2023 -- both rightly focus on high-impact use cases, from health to climate. The overarching principle is to embrace AI as a \"force for good\" and harness it to uplift and empower people and businesses. </p><p> Growing old, getting hotSingapore faces two structural medium-term challenges -- our rapidly ageing population and that minor issue of the planet getting uncomfortably hot. </p><p> Let us start with ageing. By 2030, one in four citizens will be over 65. We are on track to become the world's most gracefully greying tech utopia. But graceful does not come cheap. The healthcare bill is ballooning, the workforce is thinning, and honestly, who is going to look after all of us when we are 85 and trying to reset our retina-scanning Singpass because we forgot the password again? Here is where the optimist says AI can come to the rescue -- AI can help diagnose chronic diseases early, manage eldercare through companion robots, and automate boring hospital admin that nurses are too overworked to do. </p><p> At the global level, AI has revolutionised human understanding of protein folding and accelerated drug discovery. At the local level, the Singapore Civil Defence Force is already utilising AI to optimise ambulance dispatch, and predictive analytics help to forecast emergency hot spots and reduce response times -- this is about saving lives, not just saving seconds. </p><p> AI can also predict which parts of Singapore are most likely to flood or face extreme hot spots. In a climate-stressed world, there will be many use cases for disaster preparedness. But let us not get ahead of ourselves. AI is not quite ready to replace good bedside manners of doctors or a comforting touch when one is in pain. The human factor is important even in an AI-enabled economy. </p><p> While AI may boost productivity, it could also potentially displace some jobs. An IMF study recently estimated that about 77 per cent of jobs of Singapore's employed workers are highly exposed to AI. That is not just your Grab driver being potentially displaced by autonomous vehicles, it is also possibly your accountant, your insurance underwriter, maybe even your therapist. There could be a potential backlash from workers who fear being replaced before they can retrain. Thankfully, Singapore is not sleepwalking into this dystopian future. SkillsFuture credits are pushing the needle on inclusive adoption of AI and AI literacy. Managing and pacing this shift with empathy will be key.</p><p> For the climate crisis, Singapore, being a low-lying island, is quite literally on the front lines of rising sea levels. AI can be a powerful ally to that $100 billion coastal protection plan by modelling coastal erosion, optimising energy usage, powering smart grids, and detecting leakages in water infrastructure. In fact, Singapore could have a real shot at becoming a hub for \"green AI\" -- the kind that helps build climate resilience and reduce emissions. We have the research infrastructure, a hyper-urban test bed, and the political will to turn sustainability into economic strategy. </p><p> But when it comes to AI, the risk is not just one of falling behind; it is also that we will run ahead without looking where we are going. The message is clear: digital resilience is as important as digital ambition. For one thing, we must ensure small and medium-sized enterprises, which are Singapore's economic backbone, do not get left behind in the AI gold rush. Big companies have the funds to hire AI engineers. Aunty Mary's small bakery in Toa Payoh does not. That is where public policy comes in with simple, sector-specific solutions and cost-efficient tools that can move the top-line and reduce manpower headaches. </p><p> Arthur C. Clarke said \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\". But just because something seems magical does not mean we should not question how it works. Responsible AI governance is also important. Singapore has the chance to be the model on AI ethics and governance others can learn from. </p><p> Going back to the ESR, it makes sense to relook Singapore's economic strategy beyond the 2030 runway. The Committee on the Future Economy, which issued a report in 2017, had previously outlined the economic strategy to 2030. Economic resilience is key in the current, uncertain geopolitical landscape and that requires pre-empting potential risk factors, including the challenges of AI. </p><p> At the end of the day, it is not just about driving GDP growth, but creating a nation where technology empowers us and creates meaningful jobs that provide for families. </p><p> Imagine if Singaporean students, regardless of socio-economic class, can learn to code from a free AI tutor, while a Singaporean worker can individually customise upskilling advice with AI-identified skill gaps, and an elderly Singaporean can get medical check-ups through a voice bot that speaks fluent Hokkien. And that, if you ask me, is the real upgrade we should all be aiming for in our vision of an AI-enabled Singapore. </p><p> Selena Ling is chief economist and head of global markets research and strategy at OCBC.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["For the climate crisis, Singapore, being a low-lying island, is quite literally on the front lines of rising sea levels.

Currently, there are 54 nature ways in Singapore, stretching 240km in total.</p><p> An example of a nature way is the Lornie Nature Corridor, which comprises a nature way and a park connector, and acts as a buffer to the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. The corridor has more than 100 species of trees and shrubs so far. </p><p> For example, the pink mempat (Cratoxylum formosum) and kempas (Koompassia malaccensis), which are both native and endangered, were planted to provide food and habitat to support various insects and birds.</p><p> NParks has also tried to re-introduce endangered plant species such as the native Singapore kopsia (Kopsia singapurensis), a tree that is considered critically endangered here.</p><p> Nature ways can help wildlife move around to find food and mates, said butterfly expert Khew Sin Khoon. </p><p> \"They are not merely green corridors, they are critical ecological highways that enable urban biodiversity to move between major nature nodes across the island,\" added Mr Khew, who is also head of Singapore butterfly interest group ButterflyCircle. </p><p> Butterflies such as the rustic (Cupha erymanthis lotis) are usually found in forests. </p><p> But these can now be seen in park connectors and even urban parks, Mr Khew said.</p><p> This could be due to the planting of the caterpillar's host plant, rukam masam (Flacourtia inermis) along roads, park connectors and urban gardens, said Mr Khew.</p><p> NParks has also planted native shrub species like the common sendudok (Melastoma malabathricum) which attracts birds like the scarlet-backed flowerpecker (Dicaeum cruentatum) and insects such as the striped nomia bee (Nomia strigata).</p><p> Improved connectivity between Singapore's green spaces will improve the gene flow between populations and also increase the butterfly's resilience to environmental changes, Mr Khew added.</p><p> A separate study by NTU in February found that road verges with a higher diversity of flowering plants attract more butterflies due to the year-round availability of nectar, as plants bloom at different times.</p><p> The researchers include Dr Tharaka Priyadarshana and Associate Professor Eleanor Slade from the Tropical Ecology and Entomology Lab at NTU's Asian School of the Environment. </p><p> While the road verges studied are not formally part of Singapore's nature ways, the researchers said they serve a similar ecological function on a smaller scale by providing resources such as nectar and shelter.</p><p> They also serve as important connectors that help butterflies move across urban landscapes of unconnected greenery, complementing the broader connectivity provided by nature ways, said the researchers.</p><p> Mr Khew said: \"Nature ways represent a science-based, scalable solution to keep Singapore's City in Nature vision alive -- not just for humans, but for the butterflies, birds, and countless other species that share our city.\" </p><p> Planting trees,  growing rootsAs part of the City in Nature push, Singapore in 2020 launched the OneMillionTrees movement. </p><p> The aim is to plant a million more trees across the island by 2030. </p><p> As at June, 800,868 trees have been planted across Singapore, according to NParks' website.</p><p> More trees have been planted in places such as schools and residential and industrial estates since the launch of the movement. </p><p> On industrialised Jurong Island, for example, more than 34,000 trees have been planted since 2020. More than 80 species of trees such as the common sterculia (Sterculia parviflora) and the shore laurel (Neolitsea cassia) were chosen to line the island -- one of Singapore's warmest areas. </p><p> The tree species were chosen based on their ability to tolerate drought, their colourful flowers and wide crowns that can provide shade. </p><p> Trees act as natural air filters, providing clean air. They also provide cool and shaded environments, helping to reduce the urban heat island effect -- where urban structures trap heat in the day and release it at night.</p><p> Forests also provide habitats for wildlife like the critically endangered straw-headed bulbul, a songbird, and the Sunda pangolin, and store carbon to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><p> A nation's transformationAs Singapore celebrates its 60 years of independence, the country's transformation over the decades is reflected in its greening journey, said experts. </p><p> \"In a way, this whole journey mirrors the growth of a nation -- from trying to survive, to trying to impress, to now trying to sustain,\" Dr Lahiru said. \"It reflects how we think as a society, how we see ourselves, and what we believe we need in order to survive and thrive.\"</p><p> As Singapore transitions from Garden City to City in a Garden to City in Nature, Dr Lahiru said that the City in Nature could be the \"most honest\" version of what the country has been trying to do -- to create a home for both humans and nature. \"It brings in ideas of resilience, biodiversity, and responsibility.

SkillsFuture must evolve into a dynamic, AI-enabled platform that offers real-time, individualised reskilling paths aligned with fast-changing job market needs. </p><p> Workforce Singapore and tripartite partners should coordinate to deliver stackable skill credentials, apprenticeship programmes and career conversion programmes that offer portable skills across sectors. </p><p> Protecting displaced workers and ensuring that young graduates have meaningful pathways into the new economy are essential for inclusive growth.</p><p> Leveraging green growth  as a strategic advantageThe global climate change agenda is not just a moral imperative, but a strategic opportunity for Singapore to lead in green growth. </p><p> Far from being a compliance exercise, the green transition is a source of innovation, investment and long-term competitiveness. As countries impose carbon pricing, border adjustment taxes, and stricter environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates, early movers such as Singapore can gain significant strategic advantages.</p><p>Singapore should aim to be the regional hub for carbon services, including carbon credit trading, emissions verification, and green finance. </p><p> The Singapore Exchange and Monetary Authority of Singapore have been proactive in developing the regulatory framework and promoting sustainable finance, including green bonds, transition finance and ESG disclosure standards. Regional initiatives, such as Project Greenprint, can serve as models for digital infrastructure that enable reliable tracking of carbon emissions and sustainability metrics.</p><p> Domestically, Singapore must accelerate decarbonisation by investing in solar energy, green hydrogen partnerships, energy storage systems and circular economy practices. Buildings and transportation -- two high-emission sectors -- should be fast-tracked for transformation through innovation grants and building codes.</p><p> Climate resilience is equally critical. Defending coastal infrastructure and adapting to extreme weather must remain top priorities. Policymaking should align green objectives with commercial incentives to drive private-sector innovation and participation in the transition.</p><p> Strengthening regional integrationWhile Asia will remain the growth engine for the global economy in the coming years, the global trading system is being challenged by protectionist policies and the global supply chains that are reconfiguring in response. As in the past, the supply chain reconfiguration presents an opportunity for Singapore to play a facilitating and coordinating role. </p><p> Despite rising costs, Singapore remains a premier gateway to Asean and broader Asia. Deepening regional integration can mitigate domestic constraints and broaden opportunities.</p><p>Singapore should champion seamless cross-border data flows, harmonised standards for e-commerce, and interoperable digital payment systems within Asean. Its leadership in the Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement can help shape future-ready trade infrastructure. </p><p> In professional services, Singapore's legal, healthcare and education sectors can be further internationalised by forming partnerships and regulatory bridges with neighbours.</p><p> Additionally, Singapore can leverage its strengths in governance, dispute resolution and project finance to co-lead regional infrastructure development. Initiatives such as the Belt and Road -- if aligned with transparency and sustainability -- offer platforms where Singapore can serve as a neutral, trustworthy intermediary.</p><p> Building an inclusive  and resilient societyA high-tech economy must not come at the cost of social cohesion. Technological and structural changes will exacerbate inequalities if left unmanaged. </p><p> As the gig economy grows and traditional employment declines, Singapore must fortify its social compact by revamping and enhancing the social protection framework to reflect new modes of work and emerging vulnerabilities.</p><p> Gig workers, freelancers and part-time workers require access to portable benefits including health insurance, Central Provident Fund-style retirement savings and unemployment support. The rise of platform work necessitates adaptive policy tools -- such as centralised benefits administration and universal access to basic protections -- while preserving flexibility.</p><p> Beyond labour reform, Singapore must address demographic pressures by empowering women, seniors and marginalised communities. </p><p> Family-friendly policies -- including affordable childcare, parental leave and caregiver support -- can enhance workforce participation and help reverse declining fertility. Age-inclusive hiring, flexible working arrangements and senior training programmes are critical to extend productive lifespans. The goal is a society that is not just future-ready, but also future-inclusive.</p><p> Redefining educationSingapore's world-class education system has underpinned its economic success, but the education system must now evolve to keep up with the rapid rise of AI and digital technology, and their impact on the workplace.</p><p> The nature of work is evolving more rapidly than traditional curricula can accommodate. Success in the AI era will depend not only on technical proficiency and knowledge acquisition, but also on agility, creativity and the capacity for lifelong learning.</p><p> Education must become more experiential, interdisciplinary and learner-centric. </p><p> Beyond academic rigour, schools should nurture curiosity, collaboration and ethical decision-making. Students should learn to be more discriminating in their consumption of news and information in the age of social media. Tertiary institutions must partner with industry to co-design programmes that equip students with evolving job market skills needed to operate in an AI-augmented environment.</p><p> Most importantly, learning must continue throughout life. Lifelong learning should be normalised through incentives, digital credentials and recognition frameworks that value all forms of growth.</p><p>Singapore has repeatedly turned challenges and adversity into opportunities and success -- through industrialisation, globalisation, and constantly upgrading and moving up the global value chain. </p><p> The next transformation will be more complex and challenging -- balancing technological efficiency with social equity, environmental sustainability with growth, and geopolitical risk with regional cooperation.</p><p> The nation's small size need not be a weakness, but a strength -- enabling agility, precision and unity of purpose. With visionary leadership, an inclusive society and a willingness to adapt and innovate, Singapore can once again defy the odds. </p><p> The next decade offers not only challenges, but also an opportunity to write the next chapter of resilience, renewal and reinvention.</p><p> The writer was chief economist of Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (Amro) from 2016 to 2025, where he was responsible for country and regional surveillance, as well as related research activities, of the Asean+3 economies.

between US$500 billion and US$1.3 trillion by 2030, with the amount expected to grow even larger thereafter amid worsening extreme weather events, a report has found.</p><p> The study, The Private Equity Opportunity in Climate Adaptation and Resilience, was launched by Boston Consulting Group and Temasek on Wednesday (May 7) at Ecosperity Week 2025, a sustainability event.</p><p> The rising need for financing is evident, as 87 per cent of countries now have at least one national-level climate adaptation policy, strategy or plan in place, the report showed. </p><p> Despite the projected growth in expenditure, current global spending on climate solution projects is only about US$76 billion a year, with public sources contributing the bulk of the amount.</p><p> \"To meet the rising needs by 2030, there is an opportunity for private investment in the current gap,\" the authors of the report said, also noting that the need for solutions is generating emerging value pools across value chains. </p><p> Such projects range from flood defence and wildfire protection to climate intelligence and water efficiency technologies. </p><p> Motivated to clear the misconception of climate projects being complex and nascent, lead author Daniel Oehling, a managing director and partner at BCG's Singapore office, said the report laid out the different types of investment opportunities in seven impact themes. </p><p> \"There are many companies that are sizable today, are specialised in what they do, highly profitable and fit to build for private industry networks,\" he said. </p><p> Examples with opportunities for both investments and exits include the flood defence business. </p><p> High levels of investment activityIn particular, the market for flood defence products, estimated at more than US$2 billion in 2024, would grow by 12 to 15 per cent at a compounded annual growth rate over the next five years.</p><p>  Its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margin is estimated at 20 to 30 per cent, based on the report.</p><p> The segment is where several ventures, such as Germany's IBS Technics and Norway's AquaFence, are at different stages of growth.</p><p> The report also identified five factors that can help private equity investors determine the most promising projects, and assess their attractiveness in both the short and medium terms. </p><p> Projects that have pulled in high levels of investment activity but are putting out weak forward-looking signals include smart-grid management and precision agriculture. </p><p> On the other hand, projects in climate-resilient building design, as well as rainwater and run-off harvesting, are projecting strong forward-looking signals, but are getting limited investment traction. </p><p> At the same time, the report also warns investors to be mindful of potential conflicts in the environmental outcomes of some solutions. </p><p> For example, manufacturing of concrete and steel, while playing important roles in fortifying infrastructure assets against extreme weather, consumes large amounts of energy and carbon. </p><p> \"Investors in solutions such as low-carbon concrete and green steel, which address both climate adaptation and resilience and other environmental objectives, stand to benefit more in the long term,\" it said.</p><p> Speaking at a panel at the launch of the report, Jay Koh, co-founder and managing director of climate-resilience focused private equity firm The Lightsmith Group, highlighted the importance of investing in scalable solutions now, \"so that 15 years from now, when that inevitable future has arrived, we have the solutions available at scale to try to combat that\". </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore",

In fact, the push for economic resilience and self-sufficiency may ultimately accelerate investments in sustainable infrastructure across the regions.</p><p> Large-scale policy frameworks, such as the European Green Deal and the Japan Green Transformation initiative, are funnelling substantial capital into climate-related sectors. </p><p> In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is playing a similar transformative role -- directing hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy, manufacturing and climate resilience over the next decade. </p><p> With its embedded incentives and bipartisan economic benefits, the IRA is helping to catalyse investments and innovations across both red and blue states, reinforcing the structural shifts underway. </p><p> Investors are watching these developments closely, but they are not standing still. Many continue to allocate their funds to climate and sustainability opportunities based on sound economics, long-term risk mitigation and structural market trends.</p><p> Structural drivers are stronger than everUrbanisation and population growth are driving global electricity demand, which is expected to double over the next 20 years. </p><p> Meeting this demand will require more energy of all types. But renewable energy -- particularly solar and wind -- stands out as the most cost effective. </p><p> Today, solar and wind energy are the cheapest sources of new electricity in most of the world, making it the preferred choice for new capacity, according to BloombergNEF. </p><p> As a result, global investment in renewables is nearly twice that of fossil fuels.</p><p> Another powerful driver is the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI). </p><p> AI models are extremely energy and water-intensive. For instance, generating a 100-word e-mail with OpenAI's GPT-4 model can consume the equivalent of a 500 ml bottle of water and enough energy to power 14 LED light bulbs for an hour, according to a study conducted by The Washington Post in collaboration with the University of California, Riverside. </p><p> As AI adoption grows worldwide, global demand for energy-efficient data centres and low-carbon infrastructure solutions rises.</p><p> Sustainability here to stayAcross markets, from Asia to Europe to the Americas, investors are integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors not due to the desire for political alignment, but because the financial materiality of climate risk, evolving regulatory frameworks and consumer preferences are undeniable. </p><p> Many companies are also accelerating their own transitions, integrating ESG into their risk management frameworks and net-zero strategies. </p><p> Governments are reinforcing this momentum through supportive frameworks. </p><p> Whether it is the European Union taxonomy and carbon pricing, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 or China's Carbon Neutrality plan, public policies are aligning with long-term sustainability goals. This convergence of public and private capital is a key enabler of the transition. </p><p> Sustainable investing has become increasingly accessible as awareness grows and more investment solutions become available. Beyond simple exclusions, investors today are also considering the following approaches to sustainable investing:</p><p> Aligning with a changing worldFor investors looking to begin or deepen their sustainable investing journey, the key is clarity. </p><p> Define what you want to achieve -- whether it is managing risk, capturing growth or contributing to real-world change. Then choose the right mix of tools, which may be ESG integration, thematic strategies or impact-oriented solutions.</p><p> Sustainable investing is not a passing trend.

Surely there's money to be made there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore's sovereign wealth investors certainly think so. Two separate reports by GIC, which manages Singapore's foreign reserves, and Temasek, which mainly invests in equities, focus on investment opportunities in climate adaptation.</p><p> Growing interestGIC, which wants to determine the long-term investment value of climate adaptation, estimates that global annual revenues from a set of adaptation solution categories could grow from US$1 trillion today to US$4 trillion by 2050. </p><p> The investment opportunity from these categories could increase from US$2 trillion today to US$9 trillion by 2050, of which US$3 trillion can be attributed to global warming. </p><p> These assume that global warming will reach 2.7 deg C by the end of the century.</p><p> Temasek's report, which focuses on private equity opportunities, reckons that annual worldwide demand for adaptation financing could grow to between US$500 billion and US$1.3 trillion from 2025 to 2030. </p><p> That is far more than current levels of adaptation financing, which averages around US$76 billion a year and is mostly from public coffers.</p><p> But interest is definitely growing. Temasek notes the launch of a number of dedicated adaptation and resilience investment funds since 2019, including the Lightsmith Climate Resilience Partners' US$185 million fund, the US$250 million Mirova Environment Acceleration Capital Fund and the targeted US$100 million InsuResilience Investment Fund Private Equity II fund.</p><p> Defining challengeClimate adaptation refers to the broad class of climate action that seeks to address the effects of climate change. It's distinct from climate mitigation, which is the type of climate action aimed at reducing climate change.</p><p> Global mitigation efforts have been insufficient so far to keep warming on track to stay below 1.5 deg C, a threshold past which catastrophic climate change becomes significantly more probable. That reality has made adaptation more important.</p><p> But what exactly counts as adaptation? Simple rules that investors can use to screen for potential investments are difficult to write. As Temasek explains, adaptation revenue streams \"tend to be embedded in pre-existing industrial sectors such as materials, engineering procurement and construction, and infrastructure\". This makes it difficult to clearly define adaptation solutions providers.</p><p> Temasek, with consultant BCG, maps the universe of investment opportunities into seven impact themes:</p><p> GIC, with Bain &amp; Co, identifies 14 categories of adaptation solutions that it deems to address the most likely and impactful climate hazards, and are investable:</p><p> Early bird benefitsBoth reports suggest that adaptation opportunities are still undervalued, and that it pays to invest early.</p><p> Temasek notes that due to the local nature of adaptation measures -- for example, North America uses detention and retention basis to curb inland flooding while Asia uses pipes and drains to divert floodwaters -- investors have the opportunity to enter at lower valuations before valuations account for the potential of market expansion.</p><p> However, pure plays might only comprise early-stage targets at this time; growth and buyout private equity investors might find only targets whose adaptation businesses are currently small but growing.</p><p> GIC estimates that 2050 revenues will exceed current business forecasts by 61 per cent largely because current models do not adequately price in growing demand for adaptation solutions.</p><p> Furthermore, GIC says its model's sensitivity to different climate scenarios is relatively low for the next 25 years because the impact of global warming only becomes more severe in the latter half of the century. This means that current investments can enjoy a fairly high level of confidence about returns.</p><p> Long-term investors have a \"unique opportunity to invest in a space where company earnings may positively surprise as demand for adaptation solutions increases\", GIC writes.</p><p> This article first appeared in BT's ESG Insights newsletter on May 9</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["That is far more than current levels of adaptation financing, which averages around US$76 billion a year and is mostly from public coffers.

The next bound of The Ubin Project builds on the first tranche of projects that have been completed since 2014.</p><p>These updates were shared at Ubin Day 2025, which was graced by Guest-of-Honour Minister for Education and Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee. He was hosted by Minister of State for National Development Alvin Tan. To celebrate the occasion and in commemoration of SG60, they joined FUN members and the community to plant 60 trees at Jalan Jelutong earlier today.</p><p>Good progress for next bound of The Ubin Project<br/><br/>The next bound of The Ubin Project, which was launched last year, is a holistic and long-term plan that charts efforts to ensure that Pulau Ubin's natural and cultural heritage continues to be conserved in partnership with the community in the coming 10 years.</p><p>In 2021, NParks, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and FUN kickstarted discussions to chart the future direction of Pulau Ubin. Focus group discussions with FUN members were carried out from 2022 to 2023, where they shared their suggestions on developing the next bound of The Ubin Project for the next decade (2024 to 2034).</p><p>NParks has been working closely with FUN to implement the proposals, and good progress has been achieved across various pillars of The Ubin Project:</p><p>1. Biodiversity Conservation</p><p>Introduction of Cinnamon Bush Frog into Pulau Ubin</p><p>The Cinnamon Bush Frog is a nocturnal species that mainly lives in terrestrial forests and breeds in phytotelms . It was selected for NParks' Species Recovery Programme due to its Vulnerable status in the Singapore Red Data Book.</p><p>Previously, this native rainforest species was mostly confined to the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves and their surrounding Nature Parks. Following the successful introduction of the species into Singapore Botanic Gardens between 2017 and 2018, species recovery efforts for the Cinnamon Bush Frog were extended to Pulau Ubin.</p><p>Two batches of Cinnamon Bush Frog tadpoles, which were collected from the successfully translocated population from Singapore Botanic Gardens as well as the natural population from the Nature Reserves, have been introduced at two sites on the island where artificial phytotelm habitats were installed.</p><p>The first batch, which was introduced in June 2024, have matured into adult frogs and are living outside the artificial phytotelm habitats. This serves as an early indication that suggests Pulau Ubin may be a suitable habitat for this vulnerable species and that a population may be established outside of mainland Singapore. The second batch, which was introduced at another site on the island in March 2025, is still being monitored.</p><p>If the introduction of the Cinnamon Bush Frog into Pulau Ubin proves to be successful, this would expand its local distribution in Singapore and boost the chances of long-term survival for this vulnerable species.</p><p>Ongoing reforestation and habitat enhancement programmes</p><p>a. OneMillionTrees movement</p><p>As part of the Nature Conservation Masterplan, NParks has been carrying out reforestation efforts on Pulau Ubin, and has planted more than 20,000 trees on the island since 2020.</p><p>This year, more than 3,600 trees of over 145 native species will be planted progressively across 15 sites, including Chek Jawa Wetlands, Jalan Durian, Ketam Mountain Bike Park and Sensory Trail Pond, as part of reforestation efforts on Pulau Ubin. They include Critically Endangered species such as the Paku Raja (Cycas edentata), Bayur Jantan (Pterospermum diversifolium) and Mengkudu Laut (Timonius finlaysonianus).</p><p>Such reforestation efforts will help provide more sites for food and shelter for native biodiversity on Pulau Ubin such as the Greater Mousedeer (Tragulus napu), Mainland Leopard Cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), Sunda Pangolin (Manis javanica), as well as various species of pollinators such as birds, bats, bees and butterflies. At the same time, this will further the OneMillionTrees movement to plant one million more trees across Singapore and help enhance ecosystem resilience against the impacts of climate change in the longer term.</p><p>b. Shoreline restoration works</p><p>In line with NParks' broader efforts to harness nature-based solutions for enhancing coastal resilience, restoration works are currently underway to address ongoing erosion along Pulau Ubin's northern coastline and to prevent the loss of valuable coastal beach and mangrove habitats.</p><p>Preparation works are in progress to restore approximately 2.2 kilometres of the island's northern shoreline. As part of these efforts, headlands will be built near the coast to protect existing natural beach shorelines that are vulnerable to erosion and to encourage the accretion of sand over time. In addition, rock revetments will be installed beneath eroded mangrove undercuts to prevent further erosion and support the natural growth of mangroves along these structures.</p><p>2. Community, Heritage and History</p><p>FUN Workgroup for Kampung House Restoration</p><p>As part of efforts to revitalise kampung life on Pulau Ubin and retain its heritage and rustic kampung charm, NParks has been working with FUN and the community since 2017 to progressively restore kampung houses on the island.</p><p>For more information on NParks' initiatives to enhance liveability for Ubin's community, please refer to the Media Factsheet.</p><p>In 2024, NParks announced that it would develop a Kampung House Restoration Programme, which would kick off with the restoration of five non-residential houses for community and commercial use. To do so, NParks will be establishing the FUN Workgroup for Kampung House Restoration, which will comprise several FUN members as well as stakeholders from architecture and heritage-related fields.</p><p>NParks will work closely with the workgroup to explore the adaptive reuse of the restored kampung houses. The five kampung houses to be restored under the programme are: No. 6-J, No. 25, No. 27, No. 31 and No. 425-B.</p><p>Interested parties are invited to share proposals on how these kampung houses can be restored and used.</p><p>3. Education and Research</p><p>The Ubin School initiative was rolled out in 2024 to promote environmental education and stewardship among youths through multi-disciplinary programming and experiential learning. The initiative's programmes incorporate projects under The Ubin Project, involve the Pulau Ubin community, and celebrate the island's rich natural and cultural heritage.</p><p>Tapping on citizen science for habitat enhancement efforts<br/><br/>To transform Pulau Ubin into a learning classroom set in nature, the Ubin School initiative is tapping on citizen science to support habitat enhancement efforts for Pulau Ubin. For example, in 2024 and 2025, students from Meridian Secondary School contributed to the monitoring of reforestation sites on the island by tagging the planted trees and measuring their height and girth, supporting long-term ecological data collection.</p><p>To foster greater student involvement in environmental stewardship, these efforts will also be extended to more schools such as Anchor Green Primary School and Raffles Girls' School this year. This will also complement other ongoing habitat enhancement efforts with students, such as coastal clean-ups and invasive species management.</p><p>Experiential learning through interactions with Ubin villagers</p><p>Several learning journeys conducted this year have involved members of the Pulau Ubin community. For instance, as part of their learning journey on the changing landscapes of Pulau Ubin and the relationship between the island and its villagers, students from North Vista Secondary School's Outdoor Activities Club visited a kampung house and interacted with a villager to understand the Ubin way of life. During their visit, students learnt about the cultivation of fruit trees and medicinal herbs and had the opportunity to experience drawing water from traditional wells.</p><p>Similarly, as part of Commonwealth Secondary Schools STEM Elective, which aims to nurture scientific thinking and environmental stewardship, Secondary 3 and 4 students observed the daily routines and eco-friendly practices of the island's villagers.</p><p>Furthermore, schools are encouraged to cater meals from the island's eateries, with additional time allocated for meals to allow students to visit shops and interact with villagers at the Main Village and form deeper connections with the island and its community.</p><p>Ubin as an outdoor classroom</p><p>To further position Pulau Ubin as an outdoor classroom for experiential learning, NParks has extended the Ubin School initiative to include biology student teachers from the National Institute of Education (NIE).</p><p>A pilot cohort of biology student teachers participated in the Ubin School initiative in 2024, with a second batch taking part earlier this year. Through the initiative, these student teachers are given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the logistical and pedagogical aspects of planning and conducting educational activities on Pulau Ubin to deepen students' understanding of the island's rich biodiversity, heritage and culture.</p><p>4. Nature-based Recreation</p><p>Upgrading and enhancing amenities on Pulau Ubin</p><p>NParks has completed trail improvement works on the earth tracks leading up to Puaka Hill and to Chek Jawa Wetlands from Jalan Durian, enhancing the visitor experience for those on foot or bicycles. In addition, NParks worked closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to repave roads and carry out rehabilitation works on Pulau Ubin's bridges.</p><p>To alleviate flooding during high spring tide periods, a new drain was created at the back of the Main Village earlier this year to divert rainwater away from the low-lying kampung houses. The drain beside the Wayang Stage has also been widened, improving drainage flow to the sea.</p><p>NParks will continue to work with FUN to provide and enhance amenities on Pulau Ubin, while ensuring they are in harmony with the island's natural environment. This includes ongoing efforts to upgrade and enhance interpretive displays and signage to improve wayfinding for visitors.</p><p>Shaping the future of Ubin with the community</p><p>Under the next bound of The Ubin Project, NParks has been working with FUN to engage stakeholders on charting the future direction of Pulau Ubin. To date, most villagers have been engaged through interviews to seek their views and ideas. Their feedback reflects broad support for enhancing Pulau Ubin's attractiveness while conserving its cultural heritage and natural environment.</p><p>In 2024, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) also presented the plans for the next bound of The Ubin Project as part of their Recreation Master Plan roving exhibition, to seek the public's suggestions. These suggestions will be taken into consideration as the plans for Pulau Ubin are developed.</p><p>As Singapore transforms into a City in Nature, NParks will continue to build on the first tranche of The Ubin Project and work closely with FUN to engage stakeholders on how to best preserve Pulau Ubin's rustic charm and heritage, natural environment and biodiversity for future generations.</p><p>Ubin Day 2025</p><p>Ubin Day is a culmination of Pesta Ubin, a festival organised by NParks, FUN members and the community. First held in 2002, this is the 14th edition of Ubin Day, celebrating the different facets of the island. During the two-week-long Pesta Ubin this year, close to 1,000 participants took part in over 40 activities on Pulau Ubin. Participants learnt more about Pulau Ubin's rich biodiversity and natural history through themed guided walks for photography and birdwatching, kampung heritage tours, cycling tours, mangrove kayaking and more.

I understand this is the first session of its kind organised globally. I would like to thank the IFRS Foundation and the International Federation of Accountants, or IFAC, for choosing Singapore as the host country for this timely initiative to help organisations prepare for sustainability reporting using the ISSB Standards.</p><p>2. To all participants, thank you for making time to attend this training. Your presence reflects the strong commitment across our ecosystem to enhance sustainability reporting capabilities.</p><p>Singapore's commitment to climate action</p><p>3. Climate change is a pressing reality. Recent research shows that the world may not meet its Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to below 1.5C by the end of this century[1]. Without timely policy action, the world could face significant consequences of rising temperatures.</p><p>4. Southeast Asia is amongst the most vulnerable regions threatened by climate change. By 2050, parts of Asia may face more severe heat waves and more extreme weather - from hurricanes to droughts[2]. These threats are real, and they will affect the way we live. Based on Singapore's 3rd National Climate Change Study, we may see temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius for up to 189 days a year by 2050[3]. That is more than half a year of very hot days. We will also become more vulnerable to fluctuations in global food supply and prices as we import more than 90% of our food[4].</p><p>5. We need to be prepared for the future and to stay resilient. That is why Singapore is committed to climate action. We recently submitted our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, targeting to reduce emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035[5]. We also aim to reach net-zero by 2050 and to be a climate-resilient society.</p><p>Importance of Sustainability Reporting / Climate-Related Disclosures</p><p>6. As we build climate resilience, stakeholders are also demanding companies to act on climate change. According to the 2024 Global Climate Investing Survey conducted by Robeco, 62% of global investors consider climate change as a significant or central factor in their investment policy. For investors based in Asia-Pacific, this figure is higher at 79%[6]. For companies seeking to tap onto these opportunities, climate-related disclosures can provide a competitive edge in attracting investments.</p><p>7. Besides meeting stakeholders' demands, climate-related disclosures can be a catalyst for meaningful change. When done right, these reports become powerful tools that help companies navigate risks. What makes these disclosures valuable is the accountability it creates. By measuring and disclosing emissions and plans to reduce them, companies are making commitments that translate into measurable targets and concrete actions.</p><p>8. Just as investors rely on audited financial statements, the credibility of climate-related disclosures is equally crucial. This is where an added layer of assurance on the information disclosed plays an important role as it provides stakeholders with the trust and certainty they need to make informed decisions, building market confidence. This in turn drives investment decisions, unlocking capital for sustainable initiatives.</p><p>9. As sustainability reporting preparers and assurance service providers, your role has never been more important. Every target you help to set, every report you prepare, every metric you verify - all these contribute to growing your company, as well as building a more sustainable and resilient future.</p><p>Launch of BOK</p><p>10. We understand that preparing sustainability reports is a challenging task that demands time and resources. Over the last few decades, multiple sustainability reporting standards were developed, creating a complex reporting landscape. However, the issuance of the ISSB Standards in 2023 has been a promising game-changer. It sets a global baseline for sustainability-related financial disclosures, consolidating various frameworks and providing that much needed consistency across the globe. It is notable that the adoption of the ISSB Standards is gaining momentum. In a recent survey conducted by the IFRS Foundation, nearly every jurisdiction surveyed - 47 out of 49 - has either already adopted the ISSB Standards or plans to adopt them[7]. With efforts to improve the interoperability of the ISSB Standards with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards and the Global Reporting Initiative Standards, the ISSB Standards will help companies streamline their sustainability reporting processes.</p><p>11. ACRA is fully committed to helping companies build capabilities in sustainability reporting. In 2023, the Green Skills Committee (GSC) was set up by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in partnership with Skills Future Singapore, to drive the development of green skills in Singapore. Under the GSC, ACRA co-chaired the Sustainability Reporting and Assurance (SRA) sub-workgroup with Enterprise Singapore and City Developments Limited to look into the skills and training needed for companies to prepare climate and sustainability reports using international standards, and for assurance providers to audit greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.</p><p>12. Our industry engagements revealed a gap in the market - professionals need more than just basic sustainability courses. They need advanced, practical training to develop the specialist skills required to fully understand and apply the relevant sustainability reporting and assurance standards.</p><p>13. Today, I am pleased to announce the launch of ACRA's Sustainability Reporting Body of Knowledge, or SR BOK. This document aims to guide training providers in designing specialist training programmes for professionals in the sustainability reporting field. The BOK outlines the key knowledge areas required for sustainability reporting, covering the relevant ISSB Standards as well as reporting requirements under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Each key knowledge area includes learning objectives, learning outcomes, and resources to help training providers develop their curriculum and learning materials.</p><p>14. The BOK has been validated by more than 50 key industry stakeholders. They include members of the Sustainability Reporting and Assurance sub-workgroup, company preparers, assurance providers, professional bodies, Institutes of Higher Learning and private training providers. Many of you are here today, and I would like to express our appreciation for your valuable input in shaping this initiative.</p><p>15. Following the launch of the BOK, our next step would be to work with training providers to align their existing programmes or new programmes with the BOK. We are also developing a similar BOK for sustainability assurance. With the BOK, training providers would be able to develop high quality programmes that not only prepare professionals for sustainability reporting but also meet the increasing market demands.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>16. The quality of sustainability reporting ultimately depends on the capabilities of the people behind it. Whether you're a preparer, an assurance provider, or a training provider, each of you play a vital role in this ecosystem. With your commitment and our collective efforts, we can build a strong foundation for high-quality sustainability reporting in Singapore.</p><p>17.

But the longer we delay, the more disorderly the eventual transition will be.</p><p>Climate action will be critical in Asia - for two reasons.</p><p>First, Asia is where the fight against climate change will be won or lost.</p><p>*Asia accounts for 50% of global emissions.</p><p>*90% of the world's future growth in energy demand will come from Asia.</p><p>*More than 150 million people in Asia still lack access to electricity.</p><p>*Without decarbonising Asia, the world will not reach net zero.</p><p>Second, Asia will suffer the most from climate change - lives and livelihoods.</p><p>*By 2080, over 1 billion people in South and Southeast Asia could be affected by extreme heat.</p><p>*Asia's climate-induced losses could reach about 40% of GDP by 2100.</p><p>Yet, Asia remains severely underfunded to drive decarbonisation and build climate resilience.</p><p>*Asia's funding gap for climate mitigation and adaptation stands at over 800 billion US dollars annually.</p><p>*Public capital is willing but insufficient. Private capital is ample but unwilling to commit in a big way because the risks are too high.</p><p>This is a time for philanthropy to play a larger role in driving climate action in Asia.</p><p>*A partnership across public, private, and philanthropic capital can help to effectively plugs the gaps in Asia's climate finance.</p><p>But the climate philanthropic space remains at a nascent stage.</p><p>*Globally, less than 2% of philanthropic giving goes towards preventing climate change. Of this, only 12% goes to Asia, despite the region's outsized needs.</p><p>*When engaging philanthropies, I often hear that they are unsure where to direct their resources in the climate space.</p><p>Let me outline three areas where I think philanthropic capital can support climate action.</p><p>*Crowding in private capital</p><p>*Enabling public goods</p><p>*Ensuring just transition</p><p>First, crowding in private capital for decarbonisation projects.</p><p>*Decarbonisation projects are often capital-intensive and require large upfront investments.</p><p>*This goes beyond the capacity of any single stakeholder.</p><p>Philanthropies can leverage innovative funding instruments such as blended finance to maximise the impact of their contributions.</p><p>*The premise of blended finance is to use concessional capital to de-risk and crowd in commercial capital.</p><p>*This concessional layer - coming from public and philanthropic capital - accepts first-loss and lower returns, thereby catalysing significantly more private capital.</p><p>*Compared to direct grants, blended finance allows philanthropies to amplify the impact of their giving.</p><p>Let me make a pitch for Singapore's FAST-P or Financing Asia's Transition Partnership.</p><p>*FAST-P is a blended finance platform to support green and transition projects in Asia - from phasing out coal and strengthening grid infrastructure to electrifying transportation and decarbonising industrial processes.</p><p>*The Singapore Government has pledged 500 million US dollars as concessional capital to be matched dollar for dollar by other sources of concessional capital.</p><p>*The aim is to use this 1 billion dollar base of concessional capital to crowd in four times more private capital for a total fund size of 5 billion US dollars.</p><p>*FAST-P has already attracted philanthropic funds from partners such as the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, the Asian Development Bank, and Allied Climate Partners.</p><p>Second, enabling public goods for climate action</p><p>*Many parts of Southeast Asia lack sufficient climate data, hindering mitigation and adaptation efforts.</p><p>*Philanthropies can fund data collection, enhance access, and build local capacity in data analysis.</p><p>*Let me share three specific examples where philanthropies can help.</p><p>The Global Mitigation Potential Atlas is a digital tool which identifies cost-effective emissions reduction opportunities.</p><p>*Developed by an international consortium of researchers and piloted in nine Southeast Asian countries, it is now being expanded to the US, China and Australia.</p><p>*Workshops have been conducted for officials in Southeast Asia on using this tool to help develop actionable decarbonisation policies.</p><p>The Climate Action Data Trust is a digital platform which enhances transparency in carbon markets.</p><p>*Established by Singapore, the World Bank, and the International Emissions Trading Association, the platform aggregates and standardises carbon credit data, covering 85% of all credits issued globally.</p><p>The Cambodia-Mekong Delta Aquifer Project uses science-based assessments to address sustainability challenges in the Lower Mekong Basin.</p><p>*Funded by the Global Environment Facility, this project aims to enhance resilience in agriculture, drinking water and biodiversity for millions in Cambodia and Vietnam.</p><p>*Philanthropies are in a good position to work with the scientific community and national authorities on transboundary climate risk assessments that often fall through the cracks.</p><p>Third, ensuring a just transition for communities.</p><p>The transition to a low-carbon economy will disrupt communities and livelihoods.</p><p>*Decarbonisation entails changes in long-standing economic activities - be it changing agricultural practices or phasing out fossil fuel power generation.</p><p>*We need to re-skill workers and empower communities to ensure they are able to navigate the transition.</p><p>*Philanthropies are well-placed to support just transition given their experience working directly with communities.</p><p>*Let me share two examples of just transition.</p><p>*The Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory seeks to decarbonise rice cultivation while securing the livelihoods of smallholder farmers by improving food security.</p><p>*The Coal-to-Clean Credits Initiative has stipulated that 2% of the revenues from carbon credits generated by the early phase-out of coal should go into redeploying displaced coal workers to new jobs.</p><p>Let me conclude.</p><p>Amid the disruptions entailed by the transition to a lower carbon world, we need philanthropy to help communities successfully navigate the change.</p><p>Amid the growing risks to lives and livelihoods from the climate crisis, we need philanthropy to help communities adapt and thrive.</p><p>Philanthropy cannot do all this alone.

This proactive approach comes in response to the severe economic and human costs of recent climate-related disasters. In July alone, extreme weather \u2014 primarily heavy rains and floods \u2014 caused 76.85 billion RMB (US$10.1 billion) in economic losses, affecting over 26.4 million people, displacing 1.1 million and damaging thousands of homes.</p><p>                        These staggering impacts highlight China\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, with rising coastal flooding, urban waterlogging, droughts and heavy rainfall intensifying climate risks nationwide. Notably, recent extremes \u2014 including the highest national temperature on record and Beijing receiving 60% of its annual rainfall in just 83 hours \u2014 demonstrate the growing threat. The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p>                        Projections paint an even more alarming picture. By the end of the century, heatwaves could triple, and water scarcity could worsen, deepening regional disparities. Economic losses are expected to soar, with a 1.5\u00b0C global temperature increase potentially leading to US$112 billion in direct flooding-related losses \u2014 four times the level seen between 2006-2018. Coastal cities like Shanghai face additional risks from extreme high tides. These projections highlight the pressing need for China to prioritise climate resilience and adaptation as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe.</p><p>                        This file photo taken on 17 September 2024 shows buildings silhouetted as clouds drift past the sun in Shanghai.</p><p>                        In response to growing concerns over climate change, Beijing has recognised the urgent need for effective adaptation strategies to protect infrastructure and maintain the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s legitimacy. This approach is influenced by Mao Zedong\u2019s belief that \u201cman must conquer nature\u201d, and has led to a focus on climate resilience and infrastructure in national policies, driven by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts.</p><p>                        Managing extreme weather has long been tied to political legitimacy in China. Historically, failures in this area \u2014 particularly flooding \u2014 have been seen as signs of a loss of authority, linked to the ancient concept of the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d. This practice dates back more than 4,000 years, to Yu the Great of the Xia dynasty, who is said to have tamed the Yellow River.</p><p>                        \u2018Sponge city\u2019: mismanagement impacting effectiveness</p><p>                        Challenges lie ahead. One of the biggest concerns being the potentially high costs of climate adaptation projects. The \u201csponge city\u201d concept (\u6d77\u7ef5\u57ce\u5e02), introduced in 2015 in Chinese cities to manage stormwater through permeable surfaces and green infrastructure, exemplifies these challenges. </p><p>                        Although the central government initially allocated 400-600 million RMB per city involved in the 16-city pilot infrastructure-driven programme, total spending on sponge city projects by 2017 had surpassed US$12 billion, with Beijing covering only 15-20% of the costs.

Notably, in 2021, \u201chistorically rare\u201d rainfall led to devastating floods in Zhengzhou, affecting over 14 million people, causing 398 deaths and 53.2 billion RMB (US$8 billion) in economic losses. </p><p>                        However, some critics have argued that the sponge city design, intended to handle one-in-30-year rainfall, proved inadequate in the face of such extremes.

Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat launched the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Draft Master Plan 2025 (DMP2025) Exhibition this morning - a showcase of Singapore's land use development blueprint for the next 10 to 15 years. The DMP2025 is shaped through URA's most extensive public engagement exercise to date. As Singapore celebrates 60 years of independence (SG60), DMP2025 presents a milestone in our development as a city-state. It is an opportunity to reflect on our shared journey as a nation and collective citizenship in overcoming challenges and shaping a future together.</p><p>2. The DMP2025 showcases islandwide land use plans and strategies for more inclusive, accessible homes and neighbourhoods; refreshed business nodes and vibrant workspaces; and a more resilient Singapore that is better able to respond to economic, social and climate challenges in the years to come. Together, these proposals aim to create a more liveable, inclusive and endearing Singapore, by offering Singaporeans from all walks of life with more choices for living, working and leisure, as well as a deepened sense of identity and place.</p><p>3. Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer, URA, said \"Over the past two years, we have engaged Singaporeans and communities across generations and backgrounds to better understand their aspirations. Their feedback has helped to shape a more holistic plan that reflects the priorities and concerns of our people, while addressing key challenges such as climate change and an ageing population. We thank all who have contributed to shaping the next chapter of Singapore's story. URA will continue working closely with the community to ensure that the Master Plan remains a living blueprint, rooted in our shared values and responsive to Singapore's evolving needs.\"</p><p>Building our future, together</p><p>4. Singapore's long-term and integrated planning approach is underpinned by two key frameworks: the Long-Term Plan, which sets strategic directions for the next 50 years and beyond; and the Master Plan, reviewed every five years, which translates these strategies into detailed land use proposals. The DMP2025 builds on the strategies developed in the last Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) in 2022, translating them into detailed land use plans that will guide Singapore's physical transformation over the next 10 to 15 years.</p><p>5. Since October 2023, URA has engaged almost 220,000 people for their feedback on development plans of varying scales in the DMP2025, shaped around four themes: (i) Shaping A Happy Healthy City; (ii) Enabling Sustainable Growth; (iii) Strengthening Urban Resilience and; (iv) Stewarding Nature and Heritage. Through multiple platforms, including exhibitions, dialogues, focus group discussions and surveys, URA carried out its most extensive public engagement effort to date, to ensure that the DMP2025 balances diverse priorities at the national, community and individual levels.</p><p>6. See Annex A [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32a.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32a.pdf</url>] for more information about the DMP2025 and engagement journey.</p><p>(I) Shaping a Happy Healthy City: Building stronger communities and catering to diverse aspirations</p><p>7. The DMP2025 presents plans for a more vibrant and inclusive city where everyone can have better access to essential services, lead more active lifestyles and move around with ease. A variety of housing options will be introduced islandwide to cater to different needs, ages and backgrounds. They will enable more Singaporeans to benefit from convenient access to transport connectivity and a good range of amenities. At the same time, the DMP2025 plans will also create endearing neighbourhoods with lively public spaces, pedestrianised streets and cycling connections that support social bonding, ageing-in-place, wellness and active lifestyles. Each neighbourhood will also be shaped with a distinctive identity to anchor residents' sense of place.</p><p>8.  In addition to the plans for new neighbourhoods in more central locations at Pearl's Hill, Marina South, Bukit Timah Turf City, the former Keppel Golf Course site and Mount Pleasant that URA showcased at the 'My City, My Home' exhibition in November 2023, the DMP2025 outlines plans for more new homes and neighbourhoods across the island.</p><p>New neighbourhoods for every need and lifestyle</p><p>9. A mix of public and private homes, along with amenities will be introduced at Dover-Medway along Dover Road in the Greater one-north area. The new Dover-Medway neighbourhood will support residents who wish to stay close to work and learning spaces in the knowledge hub. It is home to leading technology, media and biomedical firms and Institutes of Higher Learning.</p><p>10. Up in the north at Kranji, the site occupied by the former Singapore Racecourse will be redeveloped into a new housing estate that capitalises on its rustic surroundings to blend recreation and leisure attractions with daily living. After the relocation of existing uses from 2028, the Sembawang Shipyard area will be progressively transformed into a distinctive mixed-use waterfront district where the design of the future housing estate will take into consideration the area's coastal and maritime character.</p><p>11. Following the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base from the 2030s onwards, the site and its surrounding areas will gradually undergo a major transformation into a community-centric and future-ready town. It will feature an extensive network of green and blue spaces, well-connected mobility options and a distinct aviation character.</p><p>12. The development of the new neighbourhoods will be paced out, to allow for flexibility to review and adjust plans regularly in tandem with evolving needs and trends. At the same time, existing towns such as Pasir Ris and Yishun will also be rejuvenated with new homes and amenities, adding to the range of housing options for different preferences and needs.</p><p>13. There will also be more opportunities to live in and near the city centre, with a new Newton neighbourhood planned next to the Newton MRT station. Comprising three clusters at Newton Circus, Scotts Road and Monk's Hill, the neighbourhood will be shaped as a vibrant mixed-use 'urban village' with new homes set amidst greenery. At the doorsteps of Orchard Road, the new Paterson neighbourhood will be transformed into a bustling mixed-use hub with new residential developments, shops and public spaces.</p><p>14.In addition to planning for inclusive homes and neighbourhoods that cater to residents of all ages and abilities, we will provide more assisted living options and active ageing centres, to support seniors in ageing actively and independently across more neighbourhoods. This includes Community Care Apartments (CCA), which is a public assisted living typology jointly developed by MND, MOH and HDB, that pairs senior-friendly housing with on-site social activities and care services. Private assisted living apartments such as the upcoming Parry Avenue project will also present other options for senior-friendly homes with care services and wellness amenities.</p><p>Bringing recreation and amenities closer to all</p><p>15. Planning for recreational spaces to support residents' well-being and a good quality living environment has always been a priority. At the roving exhibitions for the Recreation Master Plan from April to September 2024, URA received feedback from more than 66,000 people on their recreational aspirations. In response to feedback for more affordable and inclusive recreational options near homes as well as spaces that support wellness and active lifestyles, URA will plan for better access to recreational spaces and amenities such as sports facilities, retail and community spaces, in addition to every household being a 10-minute walk from a park.</p><p>16. The DMP2025 provides for new integrated community hubs in several towns, including proposed hubs in Woodlands, Yio Chu Kang and Sengkang. Conveniently located near transport nodes, these integrated community hubs will bring together sports, recreational, healthcare and retail facilities under one roof to better serve residents' needs. Residents can also look forward to six new Sport-In-Precinct (SIP) projects islandwide that are currently being built in Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong, Ulu Pandan, Whampoa, Tampines North and Pasir Ris East, with more being studied by agencies.</p><p>17. Besides integrating recreational facilities into new neighbourhoods, we are working with agencies to activate underutilised areas such as spaces below MRT viaducts and the rooftops of HDB multi-storey car parks for social and recreational activities. Examples include the Bukit Gombak MRT viaduct that has been turned into a space for community art installation, and an upcoming SIP facility atop the multi-storey car park of 19A Dover Crescent.</p><p>More efficient, greener journeys</p><p>18. Singapore is on track to have 8 in 10 households be within a 10-minute walk from a train station by the 2030s, as part of the national objective to enhance connectivity while reducing car dependency. Additionally, our cycling network will be expanded to around 1,300km by 2030 to encourage healthier and greener journeys. In support of the goal of shaping Singapore as a more connected city for walking and cycling, the DMP2025 showcases plans for a new pedestrian bridge connecting Marina Centre and Bay East Garden, providing pedestrians and cyclists with a more direct connection between the city and the East Coast along the Round Island Route by 2029.</p><p>19.

URA's decentralisation strategy aims at sustaining a competitive and open economy for Singapore while creating vibrant workspaces and opportunities across the island for Singaporeans to thrive. Since decentralisation commenced in the early-1990s, we have progressively established a hierarchy of economic gateways and business nodes islandwide, bringing jobs and amenities closer to homes, while spreading transport flows and reducing the need to travel to the city centre. The focus of the DMP2025 is to continue driving Singapore's economic growth by strengthening our economic gateways and business nodes, rejuvenating key precincts, and supporting innovation.</p><p>21. The Northern, Eastern and Western Gateways will continue to grow as important economic hubs. Upcoming developments in Woodlands Regional Centre will capitalise on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and upcoming Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link, which is targeted to be ready by end-2026. The opening of Changi Airport Terminal 5 in the mid-2030s will reinforce Singapore's position as a global aviation hub, the PSA Supply Chain Hub and Tuas Port, scheduled to be completed in 2027 and 2040s respectively, will enhance Singapore's logistics capabilities and port capacity.</p><p>22. Agencies will embark on plans to redevelop Town Centres to support decentralisation efforts. Bishan Sub-Regional Centre for example, will undergo rejuvenation with the introduction of new workplaces, amenities, and pedestrian-friendly streets. Agencies are studying the potential of transforming Bishan Place into a landscaped pedestrian mall as well as plans for a new polyclinic and potential hawker centre that could be integrated with an upgraded bus interchange. In addition, a few government agencies are currently exploring the feasibility of relocating their offices here to jumpstart the development of this business node.</p><p>Revitalising our city centre</p><p>23. Our city centre remains a vital destination for business, tourism and culture, anchoring Singapore's status as a global hub. Rejuvenation plans are underway for our Orchard and Downtown areas. This includes plans to create a new destination park in the heart of the city by merging Istana Park and Dhoby Ghaut Green with a 500-metre stretch of Orchard Road. In addition, an elevated pedestrian link bridge between Dhoby Ghaut Green and Fort Canning Park is also being planned. When implemented, these enhancements will create a refreshed and well-connected green space offering visitors a family-friendly area to gather in the city centre.</p><p>24. Over at Marina Bay, new attractions will be introduced to boost our city's capacity to host international events in a vibrant environment for locals, businesses and leisure travellers alike. This includes a planned wellness destination and recreational spaces in the bay such as NS Square and PAssion Wave Outpost @ Bayfront, as well as the expansion of Marina Bay Sands. These efforts will further enhance Marina Bay as an inclusive and welcoming destination.</p><p>25.

As part of efforts to involve the public in shaping vibrant and endearing workspaces for the future, JTC and URA launched the \"Reimagining Former Jurong Bird Park and Jurong Hill\" ideas competition in October 2024 to seek innovative ideas that reimagine the site for both work and play. The DMP2025 has unveiled the winners of the ideas competition, who envisioned the area as a mixed-use precinct that blends work and leisure and is anchored by the site's unique terrain and industrial identity. This complements the proposed conservation of Jurong Hill Tower, as a symbol of Singapore's industrial transformation since independence. Agencies will distil suitable ideas and concepts into planning and design principles to guide the site's future redevelopment and uses.</p><p>27. See Annex D [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32d.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32d.pdf</url>] for more details of winning submissions of the ideas competition.</p><p>(III) Strengthening Urban Resilience: Safeguarding a liveable future by protecting against effects of climate change and leveraging innovative solutions to optimise land</p><p>28. The DMP2025 outlines strategies to address the impact of climate change, such as rising temperatures and sea level rise, and presents further efforts in optimising land use both above and below ground. These initiatives will continue to be expanded and refined to ensure that Singapore remains liveable and adaptable in the face of future challenges, alongside ongoing efforts to redevelop the city in response to the changing needs of our people.</p><p>Leveraging technology to protect against climate change</p><p>29. With Singapore's mean temperature projected to rise significantly by 2100 due to climate change, efforts are underway to design a cooler and more comfortable urban environment, even as we continue to develop. Environmental modelling tools are being developed in collaboration with local universities to facilitate more data-driven and scenario-based urban planning. These include digital technology to simulate wind and heat conditions, helping us create more climate-sensitive urban design, which contribute towards a more comfortable environment for precincts.</p><p>Progressing with plans for 'Long Island'</p><p>30. With rising sea levels posing a critical threat, Singapore is advancing plans for 'Long Island' - an integrated solution along the East Coast that will meet multiple national objectives. Beyond coastal protection, water and flood resilience, 'Long Island' will create land for future needs and recreational opportunities. Over 3,000 members of the public and stakeholders have contributed their ideas and feedback for this long-term project, and technical studies are currently ongoing to explore potential engineering and nature-based solutions that could be introduced, amongst others.</p><p>Exploring further possibilities for underground space</p><p>31. We will continue to tap on our underground space to free up valuable surface space for people and build robust infrastructure to support long-term growth. Significant progress has already been made over the past few decades, with underground infrastructure such as MRT tunnels, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System and Jurong Rock Caverns helping to free up valuable surface land, while supporting the development of infrastructure.</p><p>32.As part of the DMP2025, we will expand the strategic use of underground space, including exploring deep caverns at sites like Gali Batu for storage of construction aggregate, while identifying more possibilities for new underground developments through research and capability-building to enhance technical expertise in this field.</p><p>33. See Annex E [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32e.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32e.pdf</url>] for more details of the initiatives under 'Strengthen Urban Resilience'</p><p>(IV) Stewarding Nature and Heritage: Anchoring our sense of belonging and enhancing our natural capital</p><p>34. Striking a balance between social, economic and environmental considerations remains a key tenet of the DMP2025. Beyond enhancing our heritage spaces, we will leverage innovative approaches to ensure that Singapore continues to develop sensitively as a City in Nature.</p><p>A greener city</p><p>35. Our vision towards becoming a City in Nature has progressed steadily. Since 2021, 130 ha of new parks have been added and our Park Connector Network has grown to about 390km. Over the next five years, we will target to implement more than 25 new parks and over 50km of park connectors. The upcoming Kranji Nature Corridor for instance, will strengthen ecological connectivity in the northern region of the island between the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and provide new nature-based recreation opportunities for all.</p><p>36. See Annex F [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32f.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32f.pdf</url>] for more details of the new Kranji Nature Corridor.</p><p>Celebrating our built heritage and enhancing familiar places</p><p>37. Building on the Heritage &amp; Identity Plan conceptualised in the last LTPR, URA has engaged stakeholders over the past year to develop a new thematic narrative framework covering key pillars of Singapore's history and development as an independent nation: Economy, Housing, Social and Defence. The framework aims to illustrate the roles that our built heritage plays in charting Singapore's more recent history, and guides strategies to recall heritage as Singapore continues to develop, whether through adaptive reuse of selected buildings, or enhancing the characters of areas through sensitive urban design and placemaking initiatives. Agencies will continue to review the feasibility of adapting these buildings for new uses to serve our needs as well as integrate them with future developments to make them more accessible to the public.</p><p>38. In addition to the five sites and buildings1 which were announced in May 2025 to be proposed for conservation as part of the DMP2025, URA has further proposed conserving the NatSteel Steel Pavilion, the former Pasir Panjang English School as well as selected buildings at Bukit Timah Turf City.</p><p>39. See Annex G [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32g.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32g.pdf</url>] for more details of the new thematic narrative framework and buildings proposed for conservation.</p><p>40. Apart from conservation, we will also pursue other ways of recalling heritage to strengthen our sense of identity. URA has engaged over 2,300 residents and stakeholders to co-create proposals to enhance the three Identity Corridors2 of Historic East, Kallang River and Inner Ring.</p><p>41. Following public and communities' feedback and ideas, URA has identified three new identity nodes at Siglap, Moonstone Lane Estate, and Newton. They add to the 18 existing identity nodes which URA previously identified based on their distinctive local character and identity and progressively enhanced over the years. The extensive public consultations have also led to plans to enliven the Identity Corridors with more inclusive spaces, including a new pedestrian mall at Katong and new parks along Kallang River, such as at the Moonstone-Bendemeer and Potong Pasir-St Andrew's areas.</p><p>42. See Annex H [PDF, 153kb] for more details of the Identity Corridors and upcoming initiatives.</p><p>Be part of the DMP2025: Peek into the plans for tomorrow and visit the islandwide DMP2025 Exhibition</p><p>43.

While this may be true for some risks, such as broader economic transition risks, it is clear from repeated headlines that extreme weather events pose an unparallelled risk to businesses worldwide today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both in terms of financial cost and operational resilience. With disasters escalating in frequency and severity, the impact on Singapore businesses and their operations and supply chains around the region continues to grow exponentially. This impact is expected only to grow if net-zero targets are missed and higher levels of carbon are emitted into the atmosphere, further modifying global weather patterns.For organisations to not just survive but also remain competitive in the face of these changes, understanding and preparing for climate risks must become an integral part of business strategy. </p><p>Rising costs of a changing climate The statistics speak volumes. According to Nature, climate change could cost the global economy as much as US$24.7 trillion annually by 2060. For context, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods and heatwaves have already accrued over US$2.8 trillion in costs since the early 2000s. These risks are no longer hypothetical; they are here, and they are costing businesses millions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not billions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c each year. The question isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t whether climate risks will affect Singapore companies, but how extensively. This new landscape requires businesses to rethink resilience and prepare for both short and long-term challenges ahead. Understanding climate risks Climate risks fall under two primary categories: physical risks and transition risks. Both demand a firm grasp to effectively plan, adapt and safeguard operational continuity. Physical risks: Physical risks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c think floods, hurricanes, or heatwaves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can disrupt supply chains, damage property, and increase operating costs. These events aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t isolated to specific industries; though agriculture, leisure, construction, and retail are particularly vulnerable, no sector is immune. Businesses must evaluate potential vulnerabilities, whether they stem from damaged infrastructure or unexpected supply chain bottlenecks. For example, when flooding disrupts warehouses in one region, it can cascade across multiple points in manufacturing or distribution networks, creating financial blowback that compounds over time, threatening revenue and the bottom line. Singapore itself is also not immune, facing significant physical risk through more extreme rainfall and potential sea level rises \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 30 per cent of the island nation is less than five metres above sea level.Carbon emitted to date has already exacerbated physical risks today through modification of global weather patterns, and these effects are not expected to reverse even if the global economy achieves net-zero by its stated targets.Transition risks: The movement towards a low-carbon economy brings its own set of challenges known as transition risks. These can include shifting consumer preferences, legislation forcing greener operations, and reputational pressures. Transition risks are multifaceted, encompassing: discThe need for modelling climate risks \u00c2\u00a0To act strategically against these risks, climate risk modelling has become non-negotiable. Forward-looking models aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about compliance; they provide businesses with critical, actionable insights to safeguard and optimise operations for years to come. By assessing risks under varying future warming scenarios, decision-makers can proactively adapt strategies instead of scrambling reactively in the wake of disaster. Effective modelling can help businesses answer essential questions:discRetailers, for example, are already taking preemptive action \u00e2\u20ac\u201c designing flood-resistant buildings, replacing vulnerable materials such as sheet roofing, geographically diversifying their supply chain, or relocating operations altogether. Small adjustments today could prevent massive disruptions tomorrow. Additionally, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that regulators from jurisdictions including Singapore, the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, and the US state of California are shifting from voluntary recommendations to mandatory disclosure requirements, starting as early as 2025. These rules ask businesses to report both risks and opportunities associated with climate change, in line with frameworks developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d pushing organisations to assess impact not only defensively but also with an eye towards growth. Opportunities beyond risk management While climate risks dominate headlines, the flip side is often overlooked. Addressing these risks provides fertile ground for innovation, operational efficiencies, and brand differentiation. Many organisations are already capitalising on green opportunities by investing in renewable energy, developing sustainable products, and streamlining resource usage. From adopting carbon-neutral logistics to innovating in areas such as carbon capture and electric technology, these strategies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just limit exposure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they create new competitive advantages. By integrating sustainability into corporate practices, businesses can build stronger relationships with consumers, investors, and employees alike. Climate change presents looming challenges, but it also provides an unprecedented moment for leadership in Singapore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something the Singapore government and many businesses here have taken up the mantle on already. Businesses that recognise this urgency, model accurately their exposure, and adopt forward-looking strategies will not only outpace competitors but also help lead industries toward a more sustainable future. The time for complacency has passed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to prioritise proactive climate risk modelling and make resilience a key pillar of every corporate agenda.The writer is vice-president, climate solutions, at FISPolicy and legal risks: Governments worldwide are stepping up policies to mitigate climate change \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from phasing out fossil fuel vehicles to mandating net-zero targets. Failure to comply can lead to litigation, regulatory penalties, or marketplace exclusion. Additionally, climate litigation cases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c against companies for insufficient climate action or misleading claims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have more than doubled since 2015, signalling intensified scrutiny.\u00c2\u00a0Technology risks: Emerging green technologies disrupt existing systems and industries, from electric vehicles to renewable energy solutions. While these open doors for innovation, they also pose challenges for corporations slow to adopt or integrate these changes effectively, which could lead to stranded assets.\u00c2\u00a0Market risks: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers are increasingly seeking sustainable products, with 69 per cent changing their habits due to climate awareness. Failing to meet this demand risks both lost revenue and diminished brand relevance over time.\u00c2\u00a0Reputation risks: Public \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stakeholder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expectations are rising. A majority of consumers and investors now expect corporations to take visible and impactful action on environmental issues. Those who fail to meet these expectations risk lasting reputational damage.\u00c2\u00a0How will rising sea levels impact our physical locations or suppliers'\u00c2\u00a0Will new carbon regulations significantly raise overhead costs'\u00c2\u00a0How should we adjust our logistics networks to withstand frequent extreme weather events?</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 46, "title": "Sustainability\u00c2\u00a0reporting, carbon credits among key concerns ahead of Budget 2025", "published": "2025-02-17", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">MORE assistance for sustainability reporting and guidance on carbon credit usage are on companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 environmental, social and governance (ESG) wish list for Budget 2025. Some also expect Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is also the finance minister, to speak about infrastructure for adapting to climate change in the Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18). The cost and talent requirements for sustainability reporting are key concerns for companies. All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025. Large non-listed companies will also have to do so from FY2027. These disclosures include a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct, or Scope 1, emissions as well as their Scope 2 emissions, which arise indirectly from energy purchase and usage.Last year, Singapore unveiled the Sustainability Reporting Grant (SRG) to assist large companies with annual revenues of S$100 million and above. It will cover up to 30 per cent of qualifying costs for the preparation of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sustainability report, capped at S$150,000 per company.Mike Lim, a partner at venture capital firm Trirec, suggested that the SRG could be expanded to cover the cost of sustainability initiatives that are part of the reporting process, while also incorporating incentives for early adopters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting ahead of the mandatory timeline could receive additional incentives, such as tax breaks or higher grant amounts,\u00e2\u20ac said Lim, whose firm invests in clean energy and climate tech companies. </p><p>Kelvin Lim, managing director of property player LHN Group, said that more support is needed for the technical aspects of emissions reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the challenges we faced was gathering, compiling and computing the data required to translate into emissions data. More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\u00e2\u20ac he said. He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\u00e2\u20ac Chia said. The reporting of Scope 3 emissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which arise from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upstream and downstream value chains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date. We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\u00e2\u20ac said Ng. Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate. Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). From 2024, companies subject to Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.Carbon markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\u00e2\u20ac, said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\u00e2\u20ac he said. To spur the supply of carbon credits, start-up incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit. EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.While no announcements are expected on Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\u00e2\u20ac said Dr Rao.Targeted help for SMEsSeveral market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. While Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\u00e2\u20ac, said Helge Muenkel, DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief sustainability officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\u00e2\u20ac he said. Eric Lian, UOB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\u00e2\u20ac To accelerate SMEs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. Climate adaptationSome industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation. Said LHN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lim: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As climate risks intensify, we expect climate resilience and adaptation measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as enhanced drainage infrastructure, coastal protection and flood management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be key priorities in Budget 2025.\u00e2\u20acEY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tekchandani similarly expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong emphasis on climate adaptation strategies, in light of increasing climate-related risks such as flash floods and heat waves\u00e2\u20ac. This could include funding for infrastructure projects that enhance climate resilience. Budget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\u00e2\u20ac he said. DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Muenkel expects Budget 2025 to continue Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pragmatic and long-term approach, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balancing economic competitiveness with sustainable development\u00e2\u20ac.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY.

Stagflationary risks rise: Given the scale of the proposed US import tariffs, a full-scale implementation along with retaliation by foreign countries would represent a growth shock that could spark a global recession. However, our base case is for bilateral negotiations between the US and affected countries on tariff and non-tariff matters to persist for several months through 2025. </p><p> Despite the 90-day reprieve announced last week by Trump, we expect tough negotiations to delay or roll back parts of the US reciprocal tariffs while its 10 per cent tariffs remain. </p><p> Concurrently, inflationary risks have risen as US tariffs push up import costs. </p><p> The net effect of slower growth and higher inflation lead us to expect two quarters of stagflation, rather than the worst-case scenario of a recession. </p><p> We lowered US gross domestic product growth forecasts from 2.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent, reflecting the drag from the tariff shock. Tariff-related policy uncertainties are weighing on business confidence and consumer sentiment, already reflected in recent soft economic data. </p><p> 2. Central banks' dilemma: On Apr 4, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned of US inflationary risks with tariff uncertainties and the need for greater clarity before considering interest rate shifts. </p><p> We expect the Fed to hold the fed funds rate steady at 4.25 to 4.5 per cent, before deciding between higher rates to curb inflation or rate cuts to avert a potential recession. </p><p> In response to weaker growth, we expect the European Central Bank to keep cutting interest rates from 2.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent over its next three meetings. The Bank of England may also make three quarterly rate cuts from 4.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent this year. Despite weaker growth and lower rates, the euro and the pound will strengthen against the greenback as global investors seek diversifiers from the US dollar on the back of US policy uncertainties.</p><p> Asia beyond the fogBased on Chinese data, exports to the US were worth about US$525 billion in 2024.</p><p> This implies that the 145 per cent tariff applied for a full year on China's exports would result in an effective tax rise to US consumers of more than 2 per cent of US GDP alone. </p><p> We believe this potential contractionary impact on US growth, combined with a sell-off of US assets, will prompt a US-China deal to avert an unsustainable market situation. </p><p> Export-oriented Asia is caught in the crosshairs of the US-China contest for economic hegemony. The US plans to levy reciprocal tariff rates on major Asian markets -- China at 34 per cent; India at 26 per cent; Taiwan at 32 per cent; and South Korea at 25 per cent, subject to further negotiations. </p><p> Asean markets (including Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia), often seen as prime candidates for the China+1 strategy, will contend with potential tariff rates of 24 to 46 per cent. </p><p> Our overall overweight call on Asian equities, is tilted in favour of Hong Kong, China, Singapore and the Philippines. </p><p> In equities, we focus on opportunities in domestic-oriented Asian sectors and companies (such as Chinese Internet platform companies, Asean utilities and telcos); quality yield stocks; policy beneficiaries; and businesses with well-diversified intra-Asia supply chains and flexible distribution nodes. </p><p> These companies will be relatively buffered from the shifting sands of global tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. However, the second order impact of economic slowdown and inflation will still hurt overall business growth.</p><p> In fixed income, sectors such as financials, utilities and telecoms could be more defensive and see smaller spread widening on a relative basis. </p><p> We prefer quality credits with strong fundamentals such as issuers with a diversified business profile, stable cash flows and strong liquidity buffer, and sectors which are more defensive or systemically important that stand to benefit from government support.</p><p> Long-term investors' playbook amid uncertaintyWhen the only certainty is uncertainty, stick to the process. To avoid crystal-ball gazing and getting whipsawed by short-term swings, we believe in the core principles of prioritising a long-term investment horizon and investment discipline of building diversified risk-aware portfolios.</p><p> The investment playbook for many investors that hinges on US exceptionalism -- across US equities, global technology sector and a strong US dollar -- now faces mounting challenges. Yet, in the midst of volatile markets, one's starting position is critical in determining next steps.</p><p> For investors who have sat on the sidelines with cash, the current dislocation in markets has created opportunities for those with patient capital to access businesses with wide moats at attractive valuations. </p><p> Focus on exposure to longer-term structural themes and super trends such as the changing world order, intelligence economy building on artificial intelligence, climate resilience and changing demographics.</p><p> For active investors, this is an opportunity to revisit asset allocation principles and actively rebalance portfolios to address potential risks and adjust expected return profiles. </p><p> Diversification is key, across asset classes, regions, currencies and investment styles, combined with strategic use of gold, alternatives and derivatives (where appropriate).</p><p> In equities, we prefer value and quality stocks with pricing power and limited exposure to tariffs. In fixed income, we upgraded our positions in US Treasuries and developed markets' investment-grade bonds from underweight to neutral to reflect rising recession risks. We downgraded emerging markets fixed income as credit spreads have not sufficiently priced in growth headwinds.</p><p> For leveraged investors, it is important to actively manage risk and maintain adequate liquidity buffers to weather the market volatility. </p><p> With severe price swings, margin calls may force investors to liquidate positions at drastically unfavourable levels, only to be caught out in violent rebounds. Create liquidity buffers to avoid having to realise mark-to-market losses on unfavourable terms.</p><p> Safe-haven assets will stay in demand until the trade impasse is resolved. </p><p> The long-term outlook for US Treasuries remains challenging as inflation rises and the US fiscal deficit worsens further. Gold will continue to shine as an effective hedge amid tariff uncertainties and concerns over US long-term fiscal sustainability that weigh on the US dollar. </p><p> For investors narrowly focused on selected public markets, the risks of over-valuation and over-concentration may rise on unpredictable growth dynamics. Adding alternative asset classes (such as private equity, private credit, hedge funds, and infrastructure and real estate) can offer differentiated return streams, lower correlation to public markets and provide downside protection in certain instances.</p><p> The writer is global chief investment officer, Bank of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Yet, in the midst of volatile markets, one's starting position is critical in determining next steps.

A very good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you today to the FAST Conference 2025.First, please let me acknowledge our partners for the FAST conference, Mr Cheng Wai Keung, Deputy Chairman of Temasek and Ms Susan Chan, Head of Asia Pacific of BlackRock.</p><p>2. We are facing a more uncertain path ahead for climate action than at any time in the last five years:</p><p>* There is greater uncertainty in global commitments to timely transition.</p><p>*Global private sector coalitions for climate action are also seeing a pullback. Many financial institutions have withdrawn from net zero alliances, and these alliances themselves have revised their objectives.</p><p>Global corporate investment more generally may also turn more cautious amid heightened trade and economic uncertainty.</p><p>3. On the positive side:</p><p>*COP29 saw broad agreement to enhance cooperation in such areas as carbon markets and climate adaptation, as well as new goals to channel financing to developing countries;</p><p>*Many countries have submitted their 2035 NDCs, reaffirming a steady pathway towards their net zero goals; and</p><p>*Many major financial institutions have affirmed continued commitment to their net zero targets.</p><p>4. We are meeting at a critical time. It is now even more important to bring together leaders across policy, finance and the real economy, to advance concrete approaches and solutions that will maintain the course for climate action and the region's transition to a climate-resilient and nature-positive future.</p><p>Enabling the Energy Transition in Asia</p><p>5. In Asia, enabling energy transition will be key to transitioning our economies.</p><p>Asia's demand for electricity is projected to rise at an annual rate of 4% until 2035[1], driven by end-use sectors such as transport, industry and buildings.</p><p>6. While energy demand is still growing, the good news is that in parts of Asia, renewable energy already makes up a significant share of the energy mix, supported by falling costs.</p><p>* Wind and solar generation capacity in China has already exceeded fossil fuel-based thermal power capacity for the first time in March this year.</p><p>*Countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia are also seeing lower renewable energy costs than that of coal-generated energy.[2]</p><p>7. There is an opportunity to drive the deployment of renewable energy and develop the infrastructure and solutions to support growth in Asian economies in a sustainable and resilient manner.</p><p>*The IEA expects renewable energy to supply more than half of Asia's increased electricity demand.[3]</p><p>*The increase in demand for electricity will catalyse a corresponding demand for supporting infrastructure and solutions. Earlier this year, ASEAN foreign ministers reaffirmed the commitment to operationalise the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) by 2045.</p><p>*Almost S$1.1 trillion in financing is estimated to be needed over the next decade to ramp up renewable energy capacity, upgrade existing power grid infrastructure, and invest in battery storage systems.[4]</p><p>8. Singapore hopes to do more to catalyse the scaling up of renewables power generation and their enabling infrastructure in Asia.</p><p>*Over the years, Singapore has supported partners across the entire infrastructure value chain, serving as the regional base to many international infrastructure development companies, project finance teams of global financial institutions, as well as multilateral development banks such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</p><p>9. We have also put in place key initiatives to enable the financing of Asia's energy transition.</p><p>10. First, we have provided clear and credible definitions through the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy (SAT) on what are green and transition activities, including activities within the Energy Sector.</p><p>*Specifically, for electricity generation using renewables such as solar PV and wind, the SAT sets out thresholds and criteria for classifying such activities as \"green\" or \"transition\".</p><p>*There has been good adoption amongst financial institutions and corporates of the SAT since its launch. Financial products have been developed based on the SAT's classifications, portfolios have been aligned with the SAT's criteria and corporate sustainability strategies have been formulated with reference to the SAT.</p><p>11. We are also bringing partners together through blended finance platforms to co-create solutions for the region, de-risk investments, and catalyse the flow of private capital, for energy transition projects.</p><p>*We launched the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) in end-2023 to raise up to US$5 billion to support Asia's decarbonisation and climate resilience.</p><p>*Within the FAST-P platform, the Green Investment Partnership (GIP), managed by Pentagreen Capital, will be ready to commence deployment in the coming months. They will mobilise capital for marginally bankable clean energy infrastructure in Asia.</p><p>*I am also glad to share that a FAST-P office, with a dedicated management team, will soon be set up to facilitate the deployment of up to US$500 million of concessional capital from the Singapore Government into the three FAST-P partnerships, alongside capital from other partners. The office will continue to work closely with asset managers, banks, and commercial and concessional investors, to promote innovative blended finance solutions for sustainable infrastructure in the region.</p><p>12. These are important milestones, but we recognise that an ecosystem approach - regulators, businesses, and financial institutions coming together - will continue to be needed to overcome these challenges. MAS will continue to work closely with the industry to develop solutions to support the region's energy transition.</p><p>Developing High Integrity Carbon Markets</p><p>13. A second area of focus for Singapore is the development of high integrity carbon markets.There are situations where the economic case for climate projects may not be well-established, making it difficult to crowd in investors and capital. High-integrity and well-functioning carbon markets can play an important role, to strengthen the economic case for decarbonisation and channel much needed capital towards worthwhile projects.</p><p>14. There have been headwinds in the last few years, but recent developments such as the finalisation of Article 6 rules at COP29, and the growing industry acceptance of meta-standards such as the ICVCM's[5] Core Carbon Principles, are helping to build confidence in carbon markets.</p><p>15. Shaping a well-functioning global carbon market will require progress in the areas of (i) supply of high-integrity credits; (ii) strong demand for credits; and (iii) robust market infrastructure and capabilities. At the GenZero Climate Summit Insights earlier this week, 2nd Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng spoke about the work the Singapore Government is undertaking to address these gaps, including through developing common standards, crowding in financing, and building capabilities.</p><p>16. The Transition Credits Coalition convened by the MAS is also an important initiative that seeks to address some of these gaps in the carbon markets.</p><p>*In its interim report launched at COP29 last year, TRACTION outlined common key high-integrity attributes across various methodologies and frameworks for the early retirement of coal and its replacement with clean energy. It also identified the transaction risks and possible risk mitigation solutions, and motivations of different buyer profiles.</p><p>17. Building on these findings, TRACTION has identified the market and technical conditions where transition credits have the greatest potential to make an impact. This will enable the industry to prioritise a pipeline of suitable transition credits projects.</p><p>18. TRACTION has also identified the key components of a Just Transition associated with the early retirement of coal plants, to guide project owners and financial institutions to address the socio-economic impacts of coal plant closures on workers and communities.</p><p>19. These findings help foster a common understanding of high-integrity and viable transition credit transactions, enhancing the scalability of transition credits as a mechanism to crowd in financing for energy transition.</p><p>20. I would also highlight the work of the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA). The SSFA is collaborating with the Singapore Government to develop guidance for companies on the credible usage of carbon credits alongside a decarbonisation plan. They are also developing solutions to deepen carbon project financing and collaborating with ASEAN counterparts on the ASEAN Common Carbon Framework.</p><p>21. MAS, together with the SSFA, are now considering initiatives to further support financial institutions' participation in carbon markets.</p><p>Strengthening Climate and Nature Resilience in the Financial Sector</p><p>22. Let me move on to a growing area of importance, that of adaptation and resilience. As the physical impact of climate change intensifies, there are mounting risks posed by both climate change and nature loss - risks that have cascading effects across sectors, markets, and value chains.</p><p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) intends to consider more closely how climate-related physical risks can pose threats to financial stability.<br/><br/>MAS took early steps in 2020 to embed resilience in the financial system, by issuing a set of Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management (ENRM). These set out expectations for robust governance, risk management, and disclosures related to environmental risks.</p><p>Our financial institutions have also started to enhance the resilience of their portfolios to climate and nature risks. For example, by integrating physical climate risk into their internal credit risk models, asset valuation, and due diligence processes. Doing so will enable them to better anticipate and manage financial loss, minimise stranded assets, and uncover new financing and investment opportunities.</p><p>23. There is growing interest in how nature loss and ecosystem degradation can amplify the effects of climate change and put nature-dependent value chains at risk. It is timely that the SSFA, in partnership with Oliver Wyman, launched a white paper two weeks ago, titled \"Financing Our Natural Capital.\"</p><p>*The whitepaper contextualises global frameworks to our region, identifies sectors of high priority from a nature materiality lens, and provides practical steps for financial institutions to incorporate nature into their business activity.</p><p>24. Beyond managing their own environmental risk, financial institutions play an essential role in mobilising capital towards solutions that enhance the adaptive capacity of economies and communities.</p><p>*The insurance industry in particular has a key role in developing risk financing solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies, to reduce the risk of such projects for commercial investors.</p><p>*Several international insurance brokers have built specialised capabilities in Singapore to support and develop such risk financing solutions, through risk analytics and advisory for physical climate risk, energy transition investments, and carbon and nature markets.</p><p>25. Ultimately, financial institutions can respond on two fronts: by managing exposure to growing climate and nature-related risks, and by innovating to finance and de-risk adaptation, resilience, and nature-positive solutions.</p><p>Staying the Course and Building the Future</p><p>26. There are near-term uncertainties about the global momentum for climate action, but Asia can continue to chart a steady course in its transition. Policymakers, financial institutions, and corporates alike should take the long view, stay the course, and invest in the infrastructure, solutions, and capabilities that will enable industries and economies to transition. In doing so, we will unlock new opportunities for growth, create jobs, build resilient economies and make possible a more resilient future for all of us.</p><p>27.

That experience sparked emotions which I've come to understand as \"eco-anxiety\" -- a deep sense of distress at the environmental devastation we are witnessing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This eventually let me to start WorkWell Leaders, a leadership-focused charity advocating for well-being and sustainable growth in the workplace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I was able to channel my anxiety into action, but many might not be so lucky. Studies show that eco-anxiety is rising, particularly among young people. Social media amplifies this distress, making it feel as if the future is already beyond repair. Those with eco-anxiety often experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and stress, and report lower overall mental well-being. The stress of knowing what is happening to our planet can breed powerlessness and even apathy.</p><p> A young woman I know had to quit her job due to eco-anxiety, coupled with the guilt of complicity in \"greenwashing\" -- conveying a false impression that a company's products are environmentally sound -- at one of the top employers in Singapore. \"I was feeling more and more depressed, and dreaded going to work every day,\" she said. </p><p> She is not alone. More than a few young working adults have reached out to me in recent times to share how conflicted and in despair they felt working for companies that simply did not care about the climate crisis. This inevitably leads to presenteeism -- physically present but mentally absent -- and quiet quitting.  </p><p> Yet, the dual crises of mental health and climate change have long been viewed as separate challenges. As we gain a deeper understanding, it becomes clear that they are intricately interconnected. Mental health, once sidelined, is now receiving the attention it deserves. Similarly, climate change is not just an environmental issue but a public health and humanitarian emergency.</p><p> As both of these crises intensify, we must approach them not as isolated issues, but as two sides of the same coin. Initiatives including the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy and the Green Plan 2030 are a step in the right direction as mental well-being is being introduced in climate resilience discussions, and vice versa, but Singapore must do more in this nexus of climate change and mental health.</p><p> Integrating mental health, climate approaches We cannot build resilient societies without addressing the trauma and displacement caused by climate change, nor can we create a healthy environment without a mentally healthy population. </p><p> As such, we must deal with the two biggest crises of our time in concert, not in silos. </p><p> However, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change for the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) under the Prime Minister's Office does not include the Ministry of Health, which leads the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy launched in 2024 to tackle mental health, now recognised as a significant health and social issue. </p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health Office (NMHO) -- to be fully established in 2025 -- is co-led by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social and Family Development, and comprises officers from the ministries of Education and Manpower -- but notably without any representation from the environment and sustainability agencies. </p><p> What are we missing here? With mental health a national priority and climate change an existential threat, the absence of integration in these national organisations creates a critical gap. </p><p>Singapore may not have to contend with the severe psychological impact of frequent natural disasters and climate-related migration that other countries are dealing with. However, rising temperatures and its mental health impact -- such as heat stress, especially for rental flat households and essential workers -- must be urgently considered. Some studies have found that a rise in temperature is associated with aggressive behaviour and suicidality. </p><p> The rise of eco-anxiety, particularly among Singapore's youth, also highlights the urgency of this cross collaboration and representation in NCCS and NMHO. A group of young people I spoke with at a university questioned whether it would be even responsible of them to bring children into a world grappling with climate change, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity. Such significant attitudinal changes could have far-reaching implications for Singapore's policies, particularly in areas such as public health, social development and economic sustainability. </p><p> It is also important to note that climate change doesn't just affect mental health -- it can also be worsened by poor mental health. When people are struggling with their mental health, they may feel overwhelmed, helpless or disconnected, making it more difficult for them to engage in proactive measures to address climate issues.</p><p> By ensuring that climate policies include mental health considerations, and vice versa, we can better support vulnerable populations and equip individuals with the resilience, motivation, and hope to confront climate challenges. </p><p> As well, the intersection of climate change and mental health presents new opportunities for research, policy and practice. This could include integrating mental health support into climate adaptation plans, extending climate finance to mental health services, and fostering community-led initiatives and creative approaches to address climate-induced stress. </p><p> How to survive and thrive'Mental health has worsened in Singapore since 2020, according to the Ministry of Health's National Population Health survey. Singaporeans have identified mental health as the biggest health problem, surpassing concerns about cancer and diabetes. Worryingly, one in three between the ages of 15 and 35 experiences severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress.</p><p> Experts found that youth mental well-being depends on connections in their social and environmental contexts. It's no wonder these same experts warn that the price of climate inaction will be the mental health of young people. </p><p> We must build environments where individuals can thrive, not just survive. Healing happens in ecosystems of care -- not in isolation. Such an ecosystem ranges from workplaces that prioritise psychological safety to schools that nurture emotional intelligence, to policies that embed mental health into broader social systems.</p><p> In this way, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy was a significant step towards addressing the crisis here, moving beyond crisis intervention to a full spectrum of care: prevention, early intervention, resilience-building, and community-based well-being.</p><p> The link between community well-being and nature is especially crucial in urban settings like Singapore, where green spaces play a vital role in fostering mental health and social cohesion. Shared experiences in nature can strengthen social bonds and foster a sense of community. As climate change threatens the environment, these natural spaces are at risk. When nature is degraded, not only is the physical environment compromised, but the mental and emotional resilience of the community is also weakened. </p><p> While working towards creating thriving individuals and communities, we must also focus on ensuring a thriving planet. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for over 50 per cent of the world's heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> In Singapore, we are experiencing rising sea levels, extreme heat and climate-related health risks. A deteriorating natural environment undermines efforts to foster mental and emotional resilience. So protecting our ecosystems is not just about preserving biodiversity, but safeguarding the mental health of our future generations. </p><p> Reasons for hopeI was delighted when the Singapore Green Plan 2030 launched in 2021 included the creation of spaces that promote mental well-being, reduce stress and enhance resilience.</p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy includes nature-based solutions, such as creating 30 therapeutic gardens across Singapore by 2030. These spaces will provide restorative environments for people with conditions like ADHD and dementia. </p><p> Furthermore, building codes now prioritise occupant well-being, with the Green Mark certification scheme and the Building Control Act playing key roles in promoting healthy, sustainable buildings.</p><p> And more recently, the Mercury Taskforce, comprising 37 public agencies led by the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment and National Environment Agency, announced the first National Heatwave Response Plan for Singapore. </p><p> The intersection of mental health and sustainability within environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks is increasingly critical for businesses. Investors are placing greater emphasis on companies that prioritise not only environmental sustainability but also the well-being of their employees and communities. </p><p> Healing from eco-anxietyThe way we treat our planet mirrors the way we treat ourselves. A world that exhausts its natural resources is the same world that exhausts its people. The burnout we feel individually is a reflection of the unsustainable systems we have created. If we want to heal the planet, we must also heal ourselves.</p><p> For me, healing has always come from nature. As a child, trees were my refuge from bullying. Thirty years later, amid a series of personal crises including a broken marriage, shattered career and financial ruin, I found myself hugging a tree again. And since then, I have hugged a tree every week after my regular run. </p><p> There's no single way forward, but there is hope in both individual and collective action. By building bridges between mental health professionals, environmentalists, policymakers, researchers and business and community leaders, we can create a future that is both sustainable and resilient for people and planet.</p><p> Anthea Ong is a former Nominated Member of Parliament, social entrepreneur, mental health advocate and author.

Because it has limited land, the nation has to import most of its food and energy and has invested heavily to reduce reliance on water imports. </p><p> Boosting resilience to supply shocks is a key policy focus for the Government, and the threats from climate change only add to the challenges. Here are some examples of what the Government and industry have been doing.</p><p> Over the past five decades, the Government has been diversifying water supplies to bolster imports from Malaysia. They include desalination plants, water recycling (Newater) and water-efficiency steps. The fifth desalination plant opened in Jurong in 2022.</p><p> Going forward, water demand is expected to grow, along with more extreme flood and drought events. According to national water agency PUB, Singapore's total water demand could almost double by 2065. By then, Newater and desalination will meet the bulk of the water demand. </p><p> Food is also a major concern. The Republic sources about 90 per cent of its food from more than 170 nations. But this leaves the country vulnerable to supply shocks, especially from extreme weather events overseas. So, back in 2019, the Government set a \"30 by 30\" target to meet 30 per cent of the nation's nutritional needs locally by 2030.</p><p> This has triggered investment in more egg production, rooftop gardens and giant vertical farms that produce vegetables and fish. And investment is growing quickly to boost production of cell-based meats such as beef and chicken. </p><p> Energy presents challenges as well. Singapore's energy system has been resilient to climate impacts to date. But it is heavily reliant on imported natural gas, and the burning of this fossil fuel contributes to climate change. </p><p> The climate challenge for Singapore comes in a different form -- finding the right path to reduce dependency on fossil fuels to meet climate target obligations, while ensuring energy security. </p><p> Among the strategies are shifting to low-carbon hydrogen imports, quickly scaling up the electrification of transport, mandating more energy-efficient buildings, and importing green power from the region. Singapore hopes to remain a regional energy hub, but the focus is on cleaner energy instead of fossil fuels. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 46, "title": "A living laboratory for future urban solutions", "published": "2025-03-27", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">SINGAPORE made headlines earlier this year when it was named the world's most innovative country by the Consumer Technology Association, the US trade body that annually organises the world's largest consumer technology trade show.

Its Garden City vision, pioneered by founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, laid the groundwork for its reputation as a global leader in sustainable urban development. </p><p> Today, Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities, with 7,800 hectares of green space. Its green cover is over 40 per cent, earning it the moniker \"City in a Garden\". The island is also among the world's 20 most carbon-efficient countries, with natural gas generating 95 per cent of its electricity. </p><p> However, achieving the national target of net zero emissions by 2050 will still be a challenging journey.

Meanwhile, difficulties such as logistics and high capital costs persist in greening Singapore's built environment that accounts for around 20 per cent of national emissions.</p><p> Learning from global leadersIn view of these gaps, Singapore can still draw valuable lessons from cities worldwide in building sustainable urban ecosystems, especially those with a high quality of life, and that prioritise environmental sustainability, are culturally diverse, focus on innovation and technology, and more.</p><p> Copenhagen is a great example. The Danish capital, which has more bikes than inhabitants, has 382 kilometres of cycle tracks and traffic lights coordinated for cyclists during rush hour, which also has reduced emissions and improved public health. Likewise, Oslo's car-free city centre and electric vehicle infrastructure showcase a commitment to green mobility. Amsterdam's long-standing commitment to its circular economy highlights how scaling resource optimisation can engage communities and drive long-term sustainability.</p><p> By learning from the global leaders, Singapore can continue to adapt and scale these best practices through a combination of strong regulatory frameworks, technological expertise, and an innovation-driven mindset. </p><p> Cross-border collaborations as innovation catalystsGiven Singapore's small domestic market, cross-border collaborations are crucial for driving innovation. Global connectivity amplifies the impact by opening doors to new markets, resources, and expertise. </p><p> Academic institutions can play a key role as an enabler of innovation and pave the way for public-private collaborations while fostering entrepreneurship, which is not the path most taken by our graduates. Hence, we must intentionally cultivate entrepreneurship by inspiring student founders and opening their eyes to global perspectives. In particular, institutes of higher learning can play active roles in fostering meaningful connections between Singapore's innovation ecosystem and the global stage.</p><p> For instance, Iterative Health, founded by a Singaporean during his academic journey at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, exemplifies the value of international exposure for startups. </p><p> In another case, Zhiyin, a China-based assistive technology startup, has worked closely with Singapore Management University undergraduates through overseas internships. The competencies and drive displayed by the students has led to their being offered the opportunity to spearhead Zhiyin's expansion into Singapore.</p><p> Power of tri-sector partnershipsUltimately however, collaboration among corporations, government, and universities is key to growing the nation's innovation ecosystem. The government provides regulatory support and funding, while the private sector brings agility, domain expertise, and the ability to scale innovations globally. </p><p> This can lead to the emergence of a tri-sector partnership (TSP) that is a collaboration between the public, private, and civil society sectors. The goal of a TSP is to combine the resources and skills of these sectors to achieve more than any one sector could on its own.</p><p> Universities in turn contribute fresh talent and creative ideas, while youth entrepreneurship drives economic growth by creating jobs and fostering innovation.</p><p> Such tri-sector partnerships can drive breakthroughs in critical areas such as sustainability, deep tech, and urban solutions, and accelerate the deployment of solutions addressing urgent challenges. </p><p> Next frontier: Water solutions and sustainable materialsFor a resource-scarce, high-density urban hub such as Singapore, two areas stand out as game changers for the future of cities: water solutions and sustainable materials. Singapore has transformed water scarcity into a strength, building one of the world's most sophisticated urban water management systems through its Four National Taps strategy. As water stress intensifies worldwide, Singapore's expertise in circular water solutions and smart water infrastructure will become increasingly valuable.</p><p> Similarly, sustainable materials are emerging as a critical component in addressing mounting environmental challenges. Singapore is making significant strides in this space, with institutions such as A*Star's Institute of Materials Research and Engineering pioneering next-generation materials that reduce waste and carbon footprints. The government has also been stepping up support and driving demand for sustainable materials in construction and manufacturing.</p><p> Empowering the next generationInstitutions aside, it is the young innovators, especially students, who are key drivers in shaping Singapore's future as an urban sustainability hub. With fresh perspectives and a readiness to challenge norms, they are uniquely positioned to co-create solutions for climate resilience, resource efficiency, and urban liveability.</p><p> A recent survey of over 6,000 SMU undergraduates found that 40 per cent are open to exploring entrepreneurship, and this interest grows with access to mentorship and startup internships. Universities can empower students to experiment, learn, and create change by providing the right networks, resources, and exposure. </p><p> Platforms such as startup and case study competitions, that connect students with the right mentorship and resources, can also be a springboard for their ideas to move the needle on addressing tomorrow's urban sustainability challenges. Participation and immersion in these initiatives can provide young entrepreneurs the opportunities to broaden their networks and sharpen their value propositions.</p><p> The road aheadSingapore should therefore strive to be more than a hub -- it must be a living laboratory where cutting-edge technologies and human-centric solutions are co-created and scaled globally to address the world's most pressing challenges. This ecosystem must be rooted in deep partnerships that transcend sectors and borders, allowing Singapore to pioneer advancements in urban solutions, green technologies, and digital health while setting new global standards for liveability and resilience.</p><p> By focusing on talent development, cross-sector collaboration, digital transformation, and global market access, Singapore is well-positioned to remain a leading global innovation magnet, attracting talent, investments, and breakthrough technologies to secure its future in the global economy.</p><p> The writer is vice-president (partnerships and engagement), and Lee Kong Chian professor of communication and technology, Singapore Management University</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["The government has also been stepping up support and driving demand for sustainable materials in construction and manufacturing.

It is also an important driver of financial and environmental dividends. </p><p> While the economic benefits of employing women are well documented, the environmental angle is often overlooked, despite evidence of the value women bring to climate agendas and conservation projects. Climate change is rarely considered when we consider the need for greater gender equality. </p><p> We should draw a tighter connection between empowering women and addressing climate change.  </p><p> Consider the evidenceGreater female representation correlates with superior environmental performance -- at the country, corporate and household levels.</p><p> Scientists have documented a statistically significant association between female parliamentary representation and the stringency of a country's climate policies. Countries with a higher proportion of women in Parliament are more likely to ratify environmental treaties and implement policies aimed at addressing climate change, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p> At a corporate level, companies whose boards included at least three women directors for at least three years achieved greater reductions in carbon-emissions intensity versus their peers in the same sector. </p><p> Such companies were also more likely (16 per cent versus 6.3 per cent) to have environmental targets linked to executive compensation, according to research by investment research firm Morgan Stanley Capital International.</p><p> A 2018 study by Yale University in the US also showed that women are more likely to be concerned about the climate crisis than men. In developed economies, women drive 70 per cent to 80 per cent of all consumer purchasing decisions, and are leading the transition to more sustainable lifestyles. </p><p> Women are more likely to recycle, minimise waste, and save water and energy in the household.  </p><p> This care for our planet has deep roots. </p><p> In rural and indigenous communities, women have played a traditional role as managers and stewards of natural resources and agricultural systems for generations. One study demonstrated that women hold greater plant knowledge than men and, more importantly, share this knowledge more widely, with horizontal knowledge transmission measured at 73 per cent for women and 61 per cent for men.  </p><p> That expertise and sharing of knowledge improves conservation on the ground, as demonstrated by the success of women-only forest protection groups, shown in multiple studies done in India. </p><p> For example, a study in India in 2006 showed that female participation in forest management is associated with a 24 per cent increase in the probability of controlling illicit grazing, a 28 per cent increase in the probability of controlling illicit felling, and a 28 per cent increase in the probability of forest regeneration. </p><p> The evidence is compelling: When women are empowered in environmental projects, their deep knowledge of local ecosystems and resource management practices, as well as their centrality to community dynamics, leads to a substantial increase in the efficacy of such projects. </p><p> This is an important factor to note for investors into nature-based solutions that protect, restore and manage natural ecosystems with the aim of mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing biodiversity. </p><p> Combining gender goals with nature-based solutions serves a dual purpose: It improves environmental outcomes while ensuring that women are allowed to fairly access and benefit from natural resources.</p><p> The emergence of  new solutionsWe are beginning to see nature-focused investors take this connection seriously. </p><p> The Kiwa Initiative in the Pacific Islands, for example, integrates gender equality into land restoration projects. It not only revitalises degraded landscapes, but also elevates women into leadership roles traditionally dominated by men.</p><p> In Nepal, a ground-breaking initiative has put women at the helm of managing the country's vast forests. This shift has led to more sustainable forestry practices, reduced deforestation and improved community livelihoods. </p><p> In Tajikistan, a women-led snow leopard conservation project has integrated species preservation with female empowerment, creating jobs and ecotourism revenues while protecting biodiversity. </p><p> Integrating gender considerations into nature investments requires deliberate strategies and innovative financial instruments. Investors now have a wider suite of investment structures to consider, from green bonds with gender criteria to investment funds prioritising female-led sustainability projects. </p><p> The Climate Bonds Initiative, a non-profit organisation working to mobilise global capital for climate action, and UN Women are partnering on new guidance to integrate gender considerations within green finance tools promoting climate resilience. </p><p> Remember the bottom lineDespite the environmental dividends, mainstreaming gender equality within sustainable finance will require continued education on the financial benefits of empowering women. </p><p> We must remember that companies with more women in senior management score higher in all dimensions of organisational performance. At a global level, a White House report published during US President Donald Trump's first term in February 2020 estimated that the value of removing legal restrictions on women globally could boost global gross domestic product by US$7.7 trillion (S$10.4 trillion), or 8.3 per cent.  </p><p> Limited data, entrenched biases and policy gaps impede progress. However, these challenges also highlight the vast potential for growth. The UN estimates that US$360 billion a year is needed to bridge the gender gap. With the promise of a US$7.7 trillion payoff, that looks like a bargain.  </p><p> It is a collective responsibility to drive gender equality, given the shared benefits that accrue to all. </p><p> Business leaders and decision-makers in all industries can take action by developing programmes and earmarking funds to promote inclusive policies and prioritise gender diversity at all levels of their organisations. </p><p> Adopting a gender-lens approach is not about being woke -- it is an economically and environmentally astute move. Doing more to connect gender equality and sustainable development will help unlock additional benefits for all. </p><p> Let us shift the narrative from \"why\" we should invest in women to how quickly we can scale these investments. The dividends are too significant to ignore -- for our economies, our environment and our shared future.</p><p> Ms Kimberly Tan is the head of investments at GenZero, an investment platform company that aims to accelerate decarbonisation. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Integrating gender considerations into nature investments requires deliberate strategies and innovative financial instruments.

A very good morning to everyone.</p><p>2. 2025 is a pivotal year in the fight against climate change.</p><p>3. Last year, we witnessed the warmest year on record-1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Yet, despite this stark warning, global momentum is wavering.</p><p>4. Geopolitical tensions are rising. Some governments are shifting focus to more immediate political concerns. Even some companies and financial institutions are re-evaluating their sustainability commitments, influenced by these shifting priorities.</p><p>5. At the same time, the world is grappling with the challenges of the energy transition. While the momentum toward renewable energy is strong, the reality is that fossil fuels still play a significant role-especially in industries and regions that lack the infrastructure for greener alternatives.</p><p>6. These are complex challenges. But they are not insurmountable.</p><p>Four Key Enablers</p><p>7. Today, I want to share four key enablers that can help sustain our transition to a greener economy: Capital. Standards. Policies. Knowledge. Let me elaborate.</p><p>Capital - Unlocking Finance for Decarbonisation</p><p>8. First, capital.</p><p>9. Transitioning to net zero is not just about ambition-it requires investment. A McKinsey study estimates we need US$9.2 trillion per year to get there by 2050. Today, we are over 35 per cent short of that target.</p><p>10. This means we must be creative in mobilising diverse financing mechanisms to unlock new sources of capital and maximise impact.</p><p>11. One such tool is blended finance, which combines public and private capital to fund projects that would otherwise struggle to secure investment.</p><p>12. At COP-29, countries agreed to triple public financing to developing nations-from US$100 billion to US$300 billion annually by 2035. Yet, even this is not enough. Public and philanthropic funding alone cannot close the gap. But if used strategically, it can de-risk green projects, attract private investment, and accelerate transition efforts.</p><p>13. Singapore is leading by example. Our Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) has pledged up to US$500 million to catalyse additional capital from public, private, and philanthropic sources. With the right partners, we could build a US$1 billion fund-targeting high-impact sectors like energy transition, coal phase-out, and hard-to-abate industries such as steel, cement, and aviation.</p><p>14. Another innovative approach is carbon credits. High-quality carbon credits direct financing toward emission-reduction projects that would otherwise not have been viable. They also offer an alternative pathway for companies to address hard-to-abate emissions.</p><p>15. In Singapore, we are piloting transition credits to accelerate the retirement of coal-fired power plants. Through the Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION), we are working with financial institutions, insurers, and industry experts to unlock new financing solutions. Already, two pilot projects in the Philippines are exploring how to make this model work.</p><p>Standards - Building a Trusted and Transparent System</p><p>16. Second, standards.</p><p>17. For the green transition to be effective, we need clear, credible, and harmonised standards.</p><p>18. Today, businesses and investors navigate a patchwork of sustainability reporting requirements, leading to confusion and inefficiencies. We must aim for greater interoperability across regions and sectors, reducing compliance burdens and ensuring that capital is directed to truly sustainable projects.</p><p>19. Singapore has taken a step forward with the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance. This framework provides a common language for evaluating green and transition activities, ensuring science-based criteria guide investment decisions.</p><p>20. To enhance global alignment, MAS has also mapped this taxonomy to the EU Taxonomy and China's Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue, under the International Platform for Sustainable Finance's Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy (M-CGT). This integration enhances cross-border financing opportunities and strengthens the credibility of sustainable investments.</p><p>Policies - Providing Clear Signals for Transition</p><p>21. Third, policies.</p><p>22. Regulatory clarity is critical. Governments must signal their commitment to decarbonisation through robust Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and supporting policies.</p><p>23. Just last month, Singapore announced our 2035 NDC-a commitment to reduce national emissions to between 45 to 50 million tonnes of CO equivalent by 2035. This aligns with our net zero target by 2050 and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to sustainability, even as global momentum slows.</p><p>24. But ambition must be balanced with pragmatism. The pace of decarbonisation depends on international collaboration and technological advancements. That is why Singapore is leveraging Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows countries to cooperate on carbon markets.</p><p>25. We have signed three Implementation Agreements under Article 6-with Papua New Guinea, Ghana, and Bhutan-facilitating international financing through high-quality carbon credits. To catalyse demand, Singapore's International Carbon Credit (ICC) Framework allows companies to offset up to 5 per cent of their carbon tax liability with these credits.</p><p>26. The reason why we have implementation with these three countries, they were selected because they have very clear policies and frameworks that are enshrined in their laws. That's a very important prerequisite for companies, investors, project developers, to invest their time and resources to develop projects in their jurisdiction. Without those clear laws, it is difficult to generate high quality carbon credit projects that will sustain time and have the longevity that investors require. </p><p>Knowledge - Driving Innovation and Expertise</p><p>27. Finally, knowledge.</p><p>28. Knowledge ties together capital, standards, and policies, forming the foundation for effective climate action.</p><p>29. Singapore is well-positioned to be a knowledge hub for sustainable finance. Our financial sector, academic institutions, and professional services form a growing ecosystem of expertise in climate finance.</p><p>30. Institutions like SGFIN play a crucial role in this landscape. I encourage you to collaborate, share insights, and drive innovation to advance climate resilience in the region.</p><p>31. Beyond financing, we must also explore how capital markets can help address climate risks.</p><p>32. For example, insurance solutions could play a bigger role in optimising capital allocation and managing risk. Parametric insurance could address revenue volatility in solar and wind power projects, while similar financial instruments could be developed for carbon credits and emerging technologies like carbon capture and storage.</p><p>Conclusion - Working Together for a Sustainable Future</p><p>33. Let me conclude.</p><p>34. The challenges before us-geopolitical uncertainty, economic pressures, and environmental risks-may seem daunting. But they should not discourage us.</p><p>35. Instead, they should drive us to act with greater urgency and purpose.</p><p>36. I have outlined four key enablers:</p><p>a. Capital - To finance the transition.</p><p>b. Standards - To build credibility and trust.</p><p>c. Policies - To provide clear, long-term signals.</p><p>d. Knowledge - To innovate and scale solutions.</p><p>37. By working together, we can create the right conditions for capital to flow, unlock new opportunities for businesses, and accelerate climate action. Climate action is not against businesses. They are aligned. We are all aligned here to make the planet better so that we can have sustainable prosperity, progress, economic progress and urban development. All this is not sustainable if we don't look after our planet. </p><p>38. Let us commit to this journey-towards a more resilient, sustainable, and prosperous future for generations to come.</p><p>39.

Many analysts expected the total tab for this work to exceed US$1 trillion (S$1.37 trillion) over the next decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But in a matter of days, President Donald Trump has thrown much of that spending into question, though how much money is affected is unclear. Some funds are frozen. Some projects are paused. And while a portion of that money is already out the door, there is an acute sense of uncertainty among people doing climate-related work that relies on government funding and approvals.</p><p> To take just one example of the chaos, consider the aid that the US sends to foreign countries to deal with climate change. The US Agency for International Development alone manages appropriations of roughly US$40 billion annually, a fraction of which goes to climate-related projects.</p><p> Mr Raj Kumar, chief executive of Devex, a media company that tracks foreign aid closely, said he had spent a lot of time on the phone with the leaders of organisations working on development projects around the world, and even he cannot make sense of this moment.</p><p> \"There's no precedent to this,\" he told me. \"As the recipient of US aid right now, you really don't know what the state of your programme is.\"</p><p> Even among people who track federal spending closely, there is widespread uncertainty about what the US government is going to fund. The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p> And while the specifics are not all known, it is already clear that US efforts to address climate change could be affected on a number of fronts.</p><p> Federal grantsOn Jan 27, the Office of Management and Budget ordered a pause on almost all federal grants and loans, saying it was necessary to root out \"DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), woke gender ideology and the Green New Deal\". </p><p> There is no such policy as the Green New Deal, but that language was clearly meant as a broadside attack on federal support for renewable energy projects. By Jan 29, the White House had rescinded that order, creating more confusion.</p><p> But the scope of climate- and energy-related programmes that could still be affected by such a freeze is vast, and includes several clean-energy programmes and efforts working to limit pollution.</p><p> Foreign aidAfter a Trump executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a 90-day freeze on almost all foreign aid. </p><p> The stop-work order affected scores of programmes around the world. Some projects have received waivers that will allow them to continue operating. </p><p> But officials have already warned that programmes focused on managing the impact of climate change will be permanently cut.</p><p> \"It's astonishing,\" said the leader of a climate resilience non-profit that receives US funding, and declined to speak publicly to avoid possible retribution. \"The gut reaction is just bewilderment.\"</p><p> Already, the non-profit, which operates in Latin America, Europe and the South Pacific, was making plans to lay off staff and wind down programmes aimed at helping the developing world adapt to rising seas and extreme heat.</p><p> \"We've never seen anything like it in 30 years of foreign aid,\" the non-profit leader said. \"What are they trying to do? Is it just to provoke chaos'\"</p><p> Fuel economy rulesOn Jan 28, newly confirmed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy signed an order seeking to roll back fuel economy standards for automakers that had been set by the Biden administration. The move could result in more tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks, and slow the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).</p><p> Wind powerOne of Mr Trump's first executive orders targeted wind energy. The move brought an immediate halt to all leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms, and directed federal agencies to stop issuing permits for all wind farms anywhere in the country for the time being.</p><p> Wind projects already under construction are unlikely to be affected for now.

Regarding currency, the nation has its own banknotes and coins but officially uses the New Zealand dollar.</p><p>                        Brown, in power since 2020, has sparked a second controversy with New Zealand in a short period. Just weeks ago, he dropped the idea of issuing separate passports for Cook Islanders after Wellington insisted that the Pacific nation first revoke New Zealand passports.</p><p>                        A month before Brown\u2019s visit to China, New Zealand began requesting the details of the proposed agreement. Wellington\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Winston Peters, made a phone call followed by a letter highlighting the need for transparency and proper consultation, citing the constitutional ties between the two sides, which include obligations to consult on defence and security matters. Brown set aside these concerns and proceeded with the agreement.\u00a0</p><p>                        Brown regarded the Cook Islands-New Zealand relationship as reciprocal, rather than one that requires the Cook Islands to seek permission from New Zealand.</p><p>Cook Islands expectations of a \u2018reciprocal\u2019 relationship from New Zealand</p><p>                        He stated, \u201cThere is no need for New Zealand to sit in the room with us while we are discussing our comprehensive agreement with China.\u201d He added that because there were no clauses related to security or loans, consultation with Wellington did not fall under the Centenary Declaration of 2001.

This disparity in energy access highlights systemic inequalities that hinder progress in agriculture, manufacturing and broader development. </p><p> Tackling these issues requires new ways of collaborating with governments, corporates and society, aligning with the WEF's 2025 sub-theme of reimagining growth.</p><p> The green energy paradoxSouth-east Asia, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, finds itself at a critical juncture. Energy demands in the region are projected to triple by 2050, straining existing systems and exacerbating development divides. Can regional energy trade offer a pathway to sustainable development while addressing economic growth and climate resilience'</p><p> South-east Asia is blessed with renewable energy potential estimated to be 40 to 50 times its current total electricity generation. The abundance of solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal resources presents a clear path to clean, sustainable energy. Yet, it trails behind other regions in transitioning to renewables. </p><p> Fossil fuels dominate energy production as South-east Asia balances economic development demands with the need for decarbonisation. The sluggish renewable transition stems from infrastructure gaps, inconsistent policy support and limited access to financing. </p><p> Ensuring a \"just transition\" -- one that protects vulnerable communities during the shift from fossil fuels -- adds another layer of complexity.</p><p> This paradox highlights a crucial question: How can the region move beyond these barriers and embrace cross-border energy trade and investment to fast-track an equitable energy transition'</p><p> Strong government action, robust policy frameworks and regional cooperation are vital to overcoming the current inertia. It is not just about scaling up clean energy projects, but also ensuring that the transition benefits everyone.</p><p> By enabling the efficient sharing of renewable energy resources across borders, energy trade can break down systemic barriers and unlock South-east Asia's potential for sustainable development.</p><p> The Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project offers a compelling blueprint for how regional green energy trade can drive sustainable development. Launched in 2022, it marks South-east Asia's first multilateral electricity trading framework, setting a precedent for cross-border collaboration in renewable energy.</p><p> Under phase one, Singapore imported up to 100 megawatts of hydropower from Laos through Thailand and Malaysia. This project showcases the benefits of regional connectivity: Laos leverages its rich hydropower resources for economic growth, Singapore diversifies its energy supply and lowers its carbon emissions, while Thailand and Malaysia earn revenue by facilitating grid connections. </p><p> If the negotiations to extend this four-nation power project succeed, energy trade could potentially double, with additional supply coming from Malaysia.</p><p> The Laos-Vietnam Renewable Energy Cooperation, established in 2016 with the commissioning of the Xekaman 1 hydropower plant, highlights the potential of regional collaboration in green energy trade. </p><p> By October 2023, Vietnam Electricity had signed 19 power purchase agreements to import over 2.6 gigawatts (GW) from 26 of Laos' hydropower plants. This collaboration boosts Vietnam's energy security and advances its renewable energy goals while promoting sustainable development in the region. </p><p>Singapore is setting the momentum for more regional energy trade, with a goal to import around 6 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, up from the initial target of 4 GW. The Energy Market Authority has issued conditional approvals to 10 projects to import low-carbon electricity from Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Five projects were awarded conditional licences, marking a significant step toward enhanced regional energy connectivity. </p><p> Private sector steps upThe private sector is increasingly recognising the economic and business opportunities in renewable energy and cross-border electricity projects. </p><p> According to a report by McKinsey and the Economic Development Board, to achieve net zero by 2050, the region must increase renewable capacity by seven to 12 times from its 2018 to 2021 levels. Currently, only 3 per cent of this target capacity is under construction.</p><p> Corporates must strive to be bold and innovative for renewables to leap forwards, driving bankable, commercially viable clean energy initiatives. By contributing to the broader green transition through impactful and scalable initiatives, businesses can thrive while advancing sustainable growth for all.</p><p> Finally, there is an urgent need to establish robust market mechanisms to attract capital for renewable energy projects. While capital is widely available across the region, the challenge is building investor confidence and creating conditions that make cross-border energy trade and green electricity projects compelling investment opportunities. </p><p> Currently, investors hesitate to commit capital, citing risks such as infrastructure gaps and regulatory uncertainty. Governments must provide regulatory certainty through clear, consistent policies resilient to political and macroeconomic changes. Effective mandates and subsidies can further stimulate demand and encourage renewable energy adoption at scale.</p><p> The private sector can also manage risks within its control, such as securing land and bridging infrastructure gaps. These measures, combined with public-private sector collaboration, can unlock the large-scale renewable energy projects that South-east Asia urgently needs. </p><p> Ultimately, the success of South-east Asia's energy transition hinges on its ability to create and optimise new avenues of growth. By enabling regional energy trade, the region can turn ambition into action -- creating a sustainable development model that addresses today's energy demands, drives job creation and secures a resilient future for generations to come.</p><p> The writer is managing director at RGE, a global enterprise operating in the bio-based resources and energy sectors.

About 60 per cent of the global population resides in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p> So, a larger number of people will potentially be affected by heatwaves, said Dr Rodriguez. </p><p> Heat can affect people of all ages but workers, such as farmers and those toiling away in construction sites, ports and non-air-conditioned factories, are especially at risk because of long exposure to rising temperatures. </p><p> In a 2024 report, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said workers in already hot climates will face ever more dangerous conditions. The ILO said workplace exposure to excessive heat in the Asia-Pacific was above the global average, affecting 74.7 per cent of the workforce. </p><p> But heat can also affect communities indirectly by worsening existing health conditions and causing food and water insecurity. </p><p> \"There is nothing better than early warning and early action because it saves lives and saves livelihoods,\" Dr Rodriguez said in the latest episode of The Straits Times' Green Pulse podcast. </p><p> \"That's the reason why action to prepare for and respond to heat is one of our top, most important priorities for IFRC in this region.\" </p><p> There are varied early responses to a heatwave. </p><p> These could include providing mobile cooling stations with air-conditioning or ice baths, supplying safe drinking water and distributing cash grants to vulnerable communities to help them meet basic needs. </p><p> \"The rationale for providing grants is to compensate for the salary loss for not working during heatwaves,\" said Dr Rodriguez. </p><p> \"We are targeting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, people with existing medical conditions that might be exacerbated by heat, and exposed groups like outdoor workers.\"</p><p> The IFRC has a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in different countries and jurisdictions.

We need external cooling systems in place.\" </p><p> The wet bulb globe temperature is a measure of heat stress that accounts for not just air temperature, but also humidity, wind speed and solar radiation.</p><p> He noted that air-conditioning systems can worsen the heat problem, especially if they are powered by fossil fuels. Energy grids in certain areas can also collapse during a heatwave when many people turn on their air-cons at the same time. </p><p> \"This is a challenge for us now -- we know that for our response, we need to have our own off-grid, clean energy options,\" he said, adding that the IFRC has committed to \"green response\" efforts to reduce the network's emissions. </p><p> At the UN climate change conference COP29 held in November 2024, the IFRC joined a number of UN agencies, including the UN Office on Disaster Risk Reduction and the World Meteorological Organisation, in highlighting the importance of early warning and early action as a way of reducing the toll that climate disasters are having on communities. </p><p> During COP29, IFRC secretary-general Jagan Chapagain also outlined plans to mobilise EUR530 million (S$746 million) through the Global Climate Resilience Platform for urban preparedness work on extreme heat, aiming to reach 100 million people in 100 cities by 2027. </p><p> South-east Asia's heat problem was also highlighted in early January at the First Global Heat Health Information Network South-east Asia Heat Health Forum in Singapore. </p><p> The forum marked the first time that experts across the heat response chain -- from humanitarian organisations to weather scientists and medical professionals -- convened under the global network to discuss South-east Asia's heat challenges and potential solutions. </p><p> One of the hub's main aims is to coordinate the regional response to rising temperatures.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["\"This is a challenge for us now -- we know that for our response, we need to have our own off-grid, clean energy options,\" he said, adding that the IFRC has committed to \"green response\" efforts to reduce the network's emissions.

Ethiopia and Nigeria, for instance, have each hosted Chinese foreign ministers seven times, reflecting the African countries\u2019 strategic importance. Ethiopia\u2019s role as the headquarters of the African Union and its strategic location in East Africa make it indispensable to China\u2019s regional diplomacy.

West Africa follows with 37 visits, focused on economic powerhouses like Nigeria and Senegal. Central Africa, with 28 visits, has been prioritised for its resource wealth, including oil and minerals. Southern Africa\u2019s 17 visits reflect partnerships with influential nations like South Africa and Namibia.

In the first phase (1991-2000), China turned to Africa along with Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, to rebuild global partnerships amidst Western isolation following the 1989 Tiananmen incident, as Africa at the time refrained from condemning China and became a critical region for a diplomatic breakthrough. </p><p>                        At the same time, the collapse of the Soviet Union left a strategic vacuum in Africa, creating opportunities for China to strengthen its ties with the continent. Symbolic diplomacy characterised this phase, as China focused on East and West Africa, securing vital resources like oil and minerals, and supporting independence movements. Key visits included Ethiopia, Kenya and Madagascar, highlighting China\u2019s dual focus on major players and smaller nations.</p><p>                        This phase emphasised economic diversification, with a focus on technology transfer and industrialisation alongside resource extraction. Visits to Ethiopia, Djibouti and Senegal showcased this comprehensive approach.</p><p>                        Amid the launch of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) at the end of 2000, and China\u2019s WTO accession in 2001, the next phase (2001-2010) was marked by a shift to economic engagement and multilateral cooperation. Large-scale infrastructure projects, such as railways, highways, industrial parks and ports, facilitated connectivity and ensured trade and resource flows. Partnerships with major powers like Nigeria and Angola, as well as smaller nations like Cape Verde, demonstrated a balanced strategy. This period also marked the institutionalisation of Sino-African relations under the FOCAC, demonstrating systematic and broad-based collaboration across various sectors.</p><p>                        Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) shakes hands with Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister Yusuf Tuggar (right) during Minister Wang\u2019s diplomatic visit to Abuja on 9 January 2025.</p><p>                        The third phase (2011-2020) started in 2011, the kick-off year of China\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan. This period witnessed China\u2019s enhanced campaign for businesses to \u201cgo overseas\u201d with the emergence of the increasing production capacity surplus at home following the 2008-2009 RMB four trillion economic stimulus. This further culminated into the unveiling of today\u2019s grand Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, integrating Africa as a key component of its global connectivity strategy. </p><p>                        Transformative infrastructure projects, like the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, deepened economic ties, while public health initiatives, including responses to the Ebola outbreak, expanded cooperation.

This is also a follow-up to The Edge Singapore's impact investing cover story from April 2024 (Issue 1132: Impact Investing: Hero or Zero?), which explored the continuum of capital, a spectrum ranging from responsible investing to venture philanthropy.</p><p>The continuum illustrates various parties' expectations of returns, impact and risk on a sliding scale, assigning labels to multiple groups in the market today. As more institutions enter the space, however, they bring with them various mandates and preferences. Venture capital (VC) firms identifying impactful start-ups and asset managers refining their engagement strategies, for example, are blurring the distinct buckets within the continuum of capital.</p><p>This cover features some of these newer entrants and their motivations, along with innovative financing structures being adopted by the world's largest financial institutions.</p><p>Local VC to fund scholarships</p><p>Initial forays into philanthropy may serve a broader, long-term purpose for profit-driven firms. Singapore-based VC firm Trirec recently announced plans to launch its non-profit arm, promising to channel a portion of its profits into funding scholarships, bursaries, research grants, thought leadership programmes and other climate-focused non-profit organisations.</p><p>Melvyn Yeo, Trirec's founder and managing partner, says the firm is in talks with two local universities to set up scholarships and bursaries in fields like chemical engineering, material science and theoretical physics. \"The intention,\" says Yeo, \"is really to energise and excite people to go into certain fields that we feel are lacking [graduates].\"</p><p>Trirec has a mandate to invest in companies around the world that focus on decarbonisation. Since 2015, it has invested in more than 20 companies across three funds. Its first fund, which closed at US$75 million in 2022, saw three exits in Southeast Asia. Its second fund, which closed at US$80 million in 2023, saw its first unicorn, Xpansiv, a market infrastructure platform for carbon and environmental commodities.</p><p>Trirec also invested in Sunseap Group, now owned by Spanish renewable energy firm EDP Renewables; and US-based nuclear fusion designer Type One Energy. Trirec has promised to release more details on its non-profit arm soon.</p><p>In a way, the VC is also looking out for itself by identifying future founders and staffing its portfolio companies.</p><p>\"We hope to not just give out scholarships and see you later, but we hope to connect them with our start-ups and our ecosystem, where perhaps they will be doing internships,\" says Yeo. \"Hopefully, they get similarly inspired that it's not just academics, but they say, 'Oh, well, these are the possibilities.' Then hopefully, either they get a job with the start-ups, or they get inspired and go back and do research, right and maybe [form] their own start-up.\"</p><p>Catalytic investments</p><p>Another investor lays claims to the \"impact investing\" title by acting as a \"scale-up capital partner\" to growth-stage companies that are solving \"some of the world's biggest social and environmental challenges\".</p><p>Catalyst is M&amp;G's impact investing arm, launched in January 2021 with a GBP5 billion investment. M&amp;G was demerged in 2019 after two years with parent company Prudential's UK and Europe businesses.</p><p>Catalyst closed four deals in Apac last year. The firm invested approximately US$25 million ($33.56 million) into Indian water purifier manufacturer Livpure in August 2024 and US$50 million into Singapore-headquartered digital banking firm Tyme Group in December 2024. The latter is currently present in South Africa and the Philippines with over 15 million customers.</p><p>Catalyst's other investments in the region are the hyperspectral imaging start-up Pixxel and Indian commercial electric vehicle manufacturer Montra Electric.</p><p>Praveg Patil, head of Asia Pacific (Apac), impact and private equity at M&amp;G, says Pixxel is a climate play as it monitors \"critical resources\" like water, air and soil from space, and flags the impact of human expansion. \"[Pixxel] allows large customers to monitor the health of water bodies. If it's [an] offshore oil rig, you can monitor oil leaks, for example. If you're a large agri[culture] grower, you can monitor the health of soil. Same with mining, you can monitor the health of resources and biodiversity.\"</p><p>Within Apac, Patil says Catalyst's investments \"resonate very strongly\" around two themes: climate solutions and financial inclusion and access. The value proposition of the company doubles as the impact measurement metric, he adds. \"It's tightly aligned. It can't be like something like a sideshow, right? It has to be very core to what the business does.\"</p><p>Patil, who joined M&amp;G in 2011 and is now based in Singapore, divides the Apac region into four key blocs, each focusing on specific countries: Singapore and Southeast Asia; India; Australia and New Zealand; and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Within these regions, Patil's team is currently targeting opportunities in healthcare and supply chain resilience.</p><p>\"We think healthcare remains under-penetrated; there are still pockets of society that need that access to healthcare,\" he tells The Edge Singapore. \"There are large supply chains, which continue to get disrupted because of all the things which are happening around the world. We think there might be interesting pockets of opportunity for us to invest given the population demographic [changes] Apac is going through.\"</p><p>In many ways, Catalyst operates like a typical VC, and the impact of its investments fits a broader definition of the investing style. But Patil thinks his firm's brand name offers it a competitive edge.</p><p>Compared to how much dry powder was available among growth funds in 2021, when Catalyst was launched, Patil thinks there has been a \"flight to quality from the founder community\" towards his firm.</p><p>\"Fast-forward four years, where we've been obviously very selective, we can now stand out as probably one of the largest global impact-focused investors,\" he adds. \"What we can bring to the table is completely different from a traditional buy-side VC or a growth investor.\"</p><p>The ABCs of impact</p><p>ABC Impact, a division of Temasek Trust Asset Management, prides itself on its impact measurement capabilities. Chief impact officer Sugandhi Matta says the past year has \"reinforced\" the belief that impact must be \"tangible, measurable and deeply aligned with enterprise value\". \"It is not an abstract ideal, but a key driver of resilience, innovation and long-term growth.\"</p><p>The impact investor showcases stunning figures in its annual \"impact review\". According to the 2024 edition, released on March 27, its portfolio companies supplied some 37.9 million people with \"essential services\" under its \"better health and education\" investment theme, up 40.1% y-o-y.</p><p>Compared to ABC Impact's 2023 report, the investor provided close to 3.5 million patients with healthcare services, up 20% y-o-y; and 17.5 million students with access to digital education content, up 46% y-o-y.</p><p>Apart from health and education, ABC Impact also invests in financial and digital inclusion, climate and water solutions, and sustainable food and agriculture; each of these is backed up with its own specific metrics.</p><p>Some highlights include the 5.7 million individuals and micro-enterprises that have gained access to financial services, up 40% y-o-y; and close to 2 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions avoided, up 19% y-o-y.</p><p>\"ABC Impact commits to assessing impact with the same rigour as financial performance, ensuring that our investments deliver both measurable outcomes and sustainable value,\" says Matta.</p><p>ABC Impact launched its second impact fund in August 2023. The ABC Impact Fund II closed last year at US$600 million, double the size of its inaugural fund. In 2024, ABC Impact added two companies to its portfolio by leading an approximately US$30 million round into Aye Finance and investing US$50 million into Tekoma Energy.</p><p>Based in India, Aye Finance has assets under management (AUM) of US$600 million and 499 branches serving over half a million underbanked micro-, small- and medium-sized business owners.</p><p>Approximately 38% of its borrowers are new to credit, entering the formal financial system for the first time. Aye Finance also offers \"shakti loans\" - collateral-freefinancial products designed specifically for small, women-owned businesses. \"These loans empower women and marginalised communities by fostering entrepreneurship and driving economic growth,\" says ABC Impact.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tekoma Energy is a renewable power developer based in Tokyo, specialising in photovoltaic solar across Northern Asia. The firm is aiming for a 400-megawatt (MW) solar portfolio within four years.</p><p>\"Aye Finance is breaking barriers to financial inclusion in India, providing small and underserved businesses with access to credit, which is critical for driving local economic growth and employment,\" says chief investment officer Tan Shao Ming. \"Tekoma Energy exemplifies ABC Impact's dedication to accelerating the global energy transition. By investing in Tekoma, we are contributing to the fight against climate change while enabling cleaner, more reliable energy access across the region.\"</p><p>ABC Impact has engaged New York-based BlueMark, an independent third-party verifier, to assess and validate its impact management practices with the Operating Principles for Impact Management, a global framework. The investor says BlueMark has successfully assured both Fund I and Fund II, confirming alignment with industry best practices.</p><p>\"As global conversations around climate action, diversity and sustainability evolve, so too must the way we define and measure impact,\" says Matta. \"There is a clear shift toward pragmatic, solutions-driven approaches, particularly in Asia, where the effectiveness of impact is judged by its ability to generate economic participation and resilience.\"</p><p>Institutional clients eager to learn</p><p>Larger investors also seek more proof that their money is driving meaningful change. According to the sustainability head at UK investment firm Aberdeen Group, institutional clients are demanding greater engagement with the companies they invest in.</p><p>\"We're all becoming a bit more sophisticated, particularly around climate change, and understand it's one thing to decarbonise your portfolio, but that's just a paper reduction in emissions. What is actually important is achieving real-world emissions reductions,\" says Danielle Welsh-Rose, deputy chief sustainability officer, investments at Aberdeen.</p><p>Greater demand for engagement means more work for Aberdeen. In addition, a pushback against ESG in the US further complicates things. \"It would put more burden on engagement, particularly if we truly see - which is what we're expecting to see - US companies disclosing less around some ESG metrics,\" says Welsh-Rose, who is based in Australia. \"We know [climate change] is a material financial risk; if we don't have the disclosures that we need in a public realm from these companies, we still need to understand what they're doing, and so then the alternative is that we have to do more engagement.\"</p><p>In the midst of creating bespoke sustainability investment approaches for institutional clients, Aberdeen also advised an Australian super fund, a retirement savings scheme where employers contribute a portion of an employee's income.</p><p>In addition to putting this particular fund's equities portfolio through a climate scenario analysis framework, Aberdeen spent \"hours every week\" advising the fund managers on climate modelling, says Welsh-Rose. \"Essentially, what they're looking for is to understand whether a company would have an evaluation impairment or uplift under different climate scenarios.\"</p><p>This client has been extremely earnest in its climate journey, says Welsh-Rose. \"One of the reasons that they engaged us and not another provider was that they were really keen to get that knowledge transfer [for] their team. They have their strategy team, risk team [and] quant people in the room to really understand at the granular level, not just looking at the results [or] the end product, but understanding the process of the [climate] modelling.\"</p><p>By involving a range of staff from outside the sustainability functions, this client raised \"really gnarly questions\" that challenged Aberdeen's process and helped refine their methods, adds Welsh-Rose. \"It's definitely a two-way partnership; we both benefitted from that, and they ended up with that knowledge transfer  and they had full confidence to present that to their investment committee. They really were able to stand behind it and say: 'We understand it and we have confidence in the process, and this is investment decision-useful information.'\"</p><p>BlackRock's blended finance tie-ups</p><p>Existing stakeholders in sustainable and impact investing have also pioneered new financing structures to achieve a double bottom line. BlackRock, a pre-eminent name not only for its size as the world's largest asset manager but also for its role as a first-mover, has been at the forefront of innovative sustainable financing structures such as blended finance.</p><p>Blended finance is a strategic way to combine different types of funding from sources like governments, philanthropists and the private sector. Proponents believe bringing together money with varying risk levels helps increase private sector investment in sustainable development.</p><p>In 2022, BlackRock closed the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), a partnership with the governments of France, Germany and Japan, alongside US impact organisations, dedicated to accelerating the flow of capital into renewable energy infrastructure across emerging markets. BlackRock announced at COP26 in November 2021 that fundraising had reached US$673 million.</p><p>Under the CFP's blended finance structure, governments contributed concessional or catalytic capital, while BlackRock brought in institutional or commercial capital. CFP's current investments include utility-scale solar in various Southeast Asian countries, Kenya's largest wind farm and an integrated renewable utility in Brazil.</p><p>While there is still some hesitation among industry players about the viability of blended finance projects, BlackRock's Heidi Yip calls the CFP a \"success story\" that serves as a precedent for future emerging market projects.</p><p>Yip joined BlackRock from GIC in February 2024, becoming head of sustainable and transition solutions for Southeast Asia. After a year in the role, Yip's job scope expanded in February to encompass the entire Asia ex-Japan region.</p><p>BlackRock has \"proven the equity case\", and it is now working on the debt capital markets, says Yip. In April 2024, BlackRock announced a partnership with the Insurance Development Forum (IDF) to mobilise insurance sector investment into climate resilience-related infrastructure. A blueprint developed by IDF seeks to create a pipeline of infrastructure projects that match insurance sector investment requirements and mobilise insurers to invest in developing \"smaller to mid-size\" infrastructure projects in developing and emerging markets.</p><p>Yip says there is a \"market gap\" in this area. \"We haven't seen capital flow into infrastructure in Southeast Asia at a level proportionate to what we have seen into developed markets.\" Speaking to The Edge Singapore, she says the hesitation by institutional clients to allocate to this market could be partly attributed to the \"real or perceived risk\" of investing in emerging markets not being commensurate with the returns.</p><p>\"Blended finance is one way where we can bring in other capital providers that are able to take more or different forms of risk, or are not looking at returns alone, but for additionality or the mobilisation of capital, or other impact. [This will] allow institutional investors to participate at the level of risk-returns that they can take on,\" says Yip.</p><p>The move also introduces Southeast Asia to institutional cli\u00adents that prefer developed market products. \"The thinking here is that once they have invested through us and understand a bit more about the market and the nature of opportunities here, then their perception of whether there is that extent of risk would be improved,\" Yip adds.</p><p>As precedent grows, so will institutional or commercial interest in such projects, reducing the reliance on the blended finance model. \"In future rounds when we are looking at similar sectors [or] geography, the amount of concessional capital needed in a blended structure would not be as high,\" says Yip.</p><p>BlackRock is also working on another blended finance debt initiative, this time with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). At COP29 in November 2024, the two parties signed a statement of intent (SOI) with the International Finance Corporation, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Nippon Export and Investment Insurance and AIA Group to explore ways to work together on a blended finance debt initiative to attract global investors \"seeking opportunities to finance corporates' decarbonisation projects at scale in Asia with a focus on Southeast Asia\".</p><p>This \"Industrial Transformation infrastructure debt programme\" is one of the programmes under Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (Fast-P), a blended finance initiative announced by the Singapore government in December 2023. Fast-P aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion from public, private and philanthropic partners to finance transition opportunities in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Under the SOI, the parties will explore \"mutually beneficial opportunities\" to provide debt financing to private sector borrowers seeking to decarbonise their businesses, including projects in hard-to-abate sectors, technology solutions for the low-carbon transformation, and industrial opportunities.</p><p>Blended finance has been around for a long time, says Yip, but mostly implemented at the \"project level\". \"It is difficult to scale when the fund manager needs to source different pools of capital and expertise [and] also negotiate all the different terms and investment or participation objectives project by project  You can spend many years just negotiating funding, alignment of interests and objectives for one project, and then when you're done funding that, you're looking at the next project [and] it starts all over again, because you have to look for a new, different set of stakeholders.\"</p><p>The \"realisation\" that has taken place across the industry is the need for scale, adds Yip. \"What BlackRock is trying to do is create blended finance structures at the portfolio level  It provides scalability because the management of that risk and a blending of risk capital is done within the fund rather than at a project level.\"</p><p>Yip, who has worked in various public and private sector firms like Singapore's Ministry of Finance, JP Morgan, McKinsey &amp; Company and Standard Chartered Bank, says: \"The industry has taken some time to get to this stage because there haven't been many examples of this model being successfully implemented until recently.\"</p><p>Social bonds measure up</p><p>Another instrument gaining ground is the social bond, which aims to address any of five broad themes, according to Sustainable Fitch: housing, health, transport, population and finance.</p><p>\"While environmental issues like climate change and biodiversity loss have made recent gains within sustainable finance, areas of social impact - including socioeconomic development, access to essential services and the elimination of poverty and inequality - have remained a challenge for many investors,\" says analyst Jonathon Smith. \"Social impact is complex, multifaceted and subject to regional considerations, likely contributing towards a broad lack of standardisation across reporting and measurement activities.\"</p><p>Issuance has stabilised since ballooning in 2020 and 2021, when investment in social infrastructure, especially healthcare, was propelled by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Sustainable Fitch, annual issuance has since averaged about US$175 billion for social bonds and US$158 billion for sustainability bonds, which have a combination of environmental and social use of proceeds (UOP).</p><p>Sustainable Fitch assessed some 3,500 labelled bonds with an aggregate total value of nearly US$2 trillion. Among geographies, French social bonds represent about a third of all social bonds reviewed by Sustainable Fitch. Perhaps by sheer magnitude, European issuers most consistently disclose social impact metrics, with notable alignment among issuers from France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.</p><p>Hoping to standardise such disclosures are regulators in Canada, the European Union, South Korea and the UK, which have either begun consulting, drafting or have mandated social-related rules.</p><p>One specific development with respect to socially related debt instruments has been the emergence of the orange bond framework. Orange bonds are a subset of social bonds focusing on gender equality, in addition to existing market bond standards set by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).</p><p>Orange bonds get their name from the colour assigned to the United Nations' fifth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): gender equality. It aims to mobilise the global bond market to build a gender-empowered financial system that embraces inclusion by valuing the full and meaningful participation of women, girls and the LGBTQI+ community.</p><p>The Orange Bond Initiative's Steering Committee met for the first time in May 2022. Its members - the Singapore-based Impact Investment Exchange (IIX), ANZ, Nuveen, Shearman &amp; Sterling, Water.org, US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) - published the Orange Bond Principles in October 2022.</p><p>Bonds are qualified as orange by committing UOP to financing projects or products that substantially and disproportionally benefit women, girls and minorities, or by supporting enterprises that are founded or majority-owned by these groups. Among other conditions, issuers and investors using the label are required to integrate a gender lens into their investment decision-making process.</p><p>Since 2021, there has been a meaningful uptake in orange bonds, both in terms of the number of issuances and cumulative value, says Smith. The label saw its largest issuance to date in January, with Dutch public sector lender NWB Bank issuing a US$1.5 billion social bond focusing on affordable housing, categorised as orange due to its disproportionate focus on providing housing to vulnerable women.</p><p>Orange bonds 'easier sell' than climate: DBS</p><p>Social sustainability bonds that aim to improve the livelihoods of women, or \"orange bonds\", are an \"easier sell\" than their climate-related counterparts, says Taimur Baig, managing director and chief economist at DBS Bank.</p><p>Speaking at the Orange Forum 2024, held in Singapore on Dec 10, 2024, Baig says: \"[Bonds with a] climate-related lens suffer from the tragedy of the commons. If I, as a country, reduce my emissions by 20% and my neighbouring country doesn't do anything, system-wide, you could argue emissions are going down and that country is benefitting from my hard work.\"</p><p>But Baig says there is \"no such problem\" with instruments like the Women's Livelihood Bond (WLB), which IIX first launched with DBS in July 2017. \"It is about improving your absolute standards, and there is no question of the tragedy of the commons as far as gender-lens investment is concerned.\"</p><p>In December 2023, IIX issued the sixth bond in the WLB Series, the US$100 million WLB6. With a 7.25% coupon rate, the WLB6 is expected to uplift over 880,000 women and girls in the Global South, making it the largest issuance in the series so far. IIX is scheduled to issue WLB7 sometime this year, and the firm is targeting an issuance of some US$134 million.</p><p>To Baig and his team at DBS, the \"macroeconomic case\" for orange bonds is \"easy\" to understand. \"[If] you have more women in the workforce, by definition, tautologically, your potential GDP growth rate goes up.\"</p><p>This holds in specific microeconomic cases, too. Baig references a Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) report from October 2024, which suggests that companies with gender-diverse boards deliver annual returns 2% to 5% higher than those with fewer women.</p><p>According to the BI Women Capital study, the return differential between the highest and the lowest quintile of women on the board was 11% in the US, 13% in Europe and a sizeable 35% in the Asia Pacific.</p><p>\"So, why should a bank like DBS be involved in not just making money, but making money with a gender lens in mind? It's because making money becomes easier if you have a gender lens in mind,\" says Baig.</p><p>Apart from orange bonds, Sustainable Fitch expects \"additional attention on social issues\" following the September 2024 launch of the Taskforce on Inequality and Social-related Financial Disclosures (TISFD), with the United Nations Development Programme as founder partner.</p><p>The TISFD, much like its climate (TCFD) and nature (TNFD) counterparts, aims to produce recommendations and guidance for businesses and financial institutions to understand and report on impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities related to people and human capital.</p><p>The TISFD's overview report provides examples of potential impact areas that could fall within its scope, including distribution of wages, compensation and benefits for employees; practices that affect the pay and conditions of value chain workers; and the impact of products and services on both communities and consumers.</p><p>Although the first version of the TISFD framework is only expected in late 2026, its potential to influence disclosure practices and investor focus is significant, says Smith. \"Both the TCFD and TNFD encouraged widespread enhancement in data measurement, collection and reporting. The TCFD eventually formed the foundation of the International Sustainability Standards Board S1 and S2 standards, which are being progressively rolled out by financial regulators globally.\"</p><p>Citi partners giving networks</p><p>Financial institutions even see opportunities in philanthropic donations, where there are no expectations of returns. In March, Citi Private Bank launched new philanthropy advisory solutions in Asia, starting in Singapore.</p><p>The move enables Citi Private Bank's clients here to establish donor-advised funds (DAF) or donate through its two registered charity partners: the Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS) and AVPN.</p><p>CFS is Singapore's oldest community foundation, boasting partnerships with over 400 charities and non-profit organisations. AVPN is the largest network of social investors in Asia, with over 600 members across 33 markets.</p><p>A DAF is a fund account for charitable donations, managed by a sponsor such as CFS or AVPN. Citi Private Bank's global family office group will connect clients with relevant charities for philanthropic contributions.</p><p>The private bank's 2024 annual survey showed that 24% of Asia-Pacific family offices provided services on philanthropy using internal and external expertise, up from 21% in 2023; and 15% of them relied on external expertise to deliver these services, compared to 9% in 2023.</p><p>\"A lot of times the founder says to the family office, 'Here's what I'm interested in, now you go and implement' and the family office is kind of looking at each other saying, 'Well, we might not have the knowledge',\" says Citi Private Bank's head of philanthropy advisory Karen Kardos at an April 2 media briefing.</p><p>Based in New York, Kardos hopes the bank can support family office staff in this regard. \"That's where advisers can be helpful and that's where the DAF can play a very important role, to almost act as that outsourced team that has the programmatic experience to be able to implement the founder's vision.\"</p><p>The minimum sum required to set up a DAF is US$250,000. The \"beauty\" of this structure, says Kardos, is that clients can set aside donations in a DAF during a \"high-income year\", and those donations grow tax-free while donors choose a beneficiary. They also receive upfront tax deductions on eligible donations \"at that point of donation\", she adds. \"You get to kind of build the plane while you're flying.\"</p><p>A generational wealth transfer could mean greater demand for DAFs in the future. \"What we see typically from the older generation is they want to build a hospital or they want to build a school,\" says Kardos. \"I think the younger generation is thinking more holistically about areas where they can make [an] impact  The younger generation [will] probably embrace using that sort of outsourced solution as they start to dip their toes in the water.\"</p><p>Wealth at peace</p><p>East and Southeast Asia account for about 7% of impact investment assets globally, up from 1.5% just three years ago, according to the non-profit Global Impact Investing Network.</p><p>At just 7%, there is still \"huge potential\" to grow impact investing in Asia, says Valerie Lau, managing director and co-head of Apac sustainable finance at UBS. Wealthy families in Hong Kong and Singapore, too, are keen to seize this opportunity, she adds.</p><p>Notably, Lau says these families are willing to follow today's \"pathways\" to investing for impact, suggesting a collaborative approach. \"Some of the pioneers in the market are becoming more receptive to pooling capital [or] investing in fund structures to try to achieve economies of scale in impact management and measurement, and more efficient portfolio management.\"</p><p>Speaking on a panel in February, Lau notes a link between these families' sources of wealth and the causes they find meaningful. \"These businesses are not making their decisions in isolation  A shipping business family may be inclined to find solutions that target environmental and social impact. A textile business will be more open to looking at perhaps textile waste or sustainable synthetic materials. So, it's an integrated approach that they're taking here.\"</p><p>Asia's needs are wide-ranging, and smaller donors are also welcome. Dawn Chan, CEO of the Centre for Impact Investing and Practices (CIIP), says the \"impact opportunity set\" in Asia is large and it does not require new technology. \"You do not need rocket science here. There is market demand and need for healthcare across the entire spectrum, and for smallholder farmers, it is not new tech that's needed; it's just scaling and execution.\"</p><p>Catalytic capital is coming from various investors, and \"sometimes it's family offices and philanthropists stepping up\", she adds. \"Sometimes, there are also companies and CSR (corporate social responsibility) stepping up, because they realise which pockets and which wallets they can actually put to use.\"</p><p>Back at the summit where Australian philanthropist Killelea declared peace a prerequisite for survival, AVPN CEO Naina Batra called for the philanthropy sector to \"step up to the challenge that the globe has presented us today\".</p><p>\"Too often, what happens when something like this happens [is that] we freeze in the headlights. We sit down and we think, 'Okay, I should stop everything till I figure out what's going on in the world.' That is really not the answer. The answer is to act faster, quicker and take more people along with you. Stopping is not an option.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Singapore", "instances": ["After a year in the role, Yip's job scope expanded in February to encompass the entire Asia ex-Japan region.

The four key areas were health, sustainability, the digital economy, and manufacturing. </p><p> RIE 2030 should include funding for greater public-private partnerships in advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, emissions reducing or removal technologies, new energy, and research and development talent attraction and development, AmChamSG said. </p><p> Increased collaboration between the public and private sectors to harness AI in healthcare can help mitigate rising medical and hospitalisation costs as Singapore's population ages. AmChamSG advocates greater government support for lifestyle management tools, such as wearables and continuous glucose monitors, as part of the Healthier SG initiative. </p><p> To ensure comprehensive patient care, it is important to include allied health professionals and expand insurance coverage for preventive care, the chamber said. </p><p> On climate and sustainability policies, there is a need for a consultative approach that balances business needs while pushing towards Singapore's net-zero emissions target by 2050, it said, adding that American firms are well positioned to supply customised innovative and clean technology. </p><p> AmChamSG recommends bulk purchasing of clean energy and pooled power purchase agreements to secure competitive rates, alongside government-supported green tariffs to ease financial burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises as they transition to clean energy. </p><p> In its 2024 manpower survey, AmChamSG found that the top two challenges to hiring more Singaporeans and permanent residents in senior-level roles are the lack of necessary specialised skills and the lack of exposure in overseas markets, global and regional operations. To address these issues, the Government needs to invest more in programmes that bridge skills gaps and facilitate skills transfer, AmChamSG said. </p><p> Tackling workplace discrimination is a key priority as Singapore strives to build an inclusive workforce. AmChamSG supports the new Workplace Fairness Bill and stresses the need for collaboration between the public and private sectors to implement effective anti-discrimination policies for all to thrive in their careers. </p><p> More support is also needed to support mature workers and help them stay competitive in a rapidly changing economy, it said.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Dr Hsien-Hsien Lei, chief executive officer of the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore (AmChamSG), said policies that promote trade, innovation, and cross-border investments enable the Republic to leverage the expertise and resources of US businesses here to drive sustainable economic growth. \"Furthermore, through continued investment in upskilling and reskilling programmes, knowledge and skills transfer, and international work experience, Singapore can build a future-ready workforce,\" Dr Lei said.

We thank Members for their various questions and suggestions on how the Public Service can do better.</p><p>2.Let me first address the cut by Ms He Ting Ru. She asked how we support exploratory scientific research and about our approach to quantum research.</p><p>3.Research and Development (R&amp;D) is a long-cycle endeavour, and any payoffs will be more appropriately assessed over the long term, rather than the short term as Ms He has suggested.</p><p>4. In any research, particularly initial research, there will be many competing ideas.</p><p>a. For instance, the mRNA vaccines that were crucial in fighting COVID-19 are a good example. The vaccines were enabled by decades of work in mRNA therapeutics, which many initially regarded as unpromising.</p><p>b. No one knew then the role that it would eventually play in the global pandemic.</p><p>c. This is the nature of R&amp;D.</p><p>5. In R&amp;D, success requires carefully balancing continuity in commitment and investment, with the ability to pivot decisively when the need arises.</p><p>6. Our National Research Foundation (NRF) takes a portfolio approach, supporting R&amp;D across fields and at different levels of maturity, and applying relevant programme management approaches. Let me explain that. There is no one method in managing the complexity of different fields of research, different levels of research, different maturities, or readiness-to-market levels of research. It is not a one size fits all. Different research areas, with different time horizons, different challenges will all require different management methods.</p><p>7. We review our programmes regularly, pivot them when necessary, and double down on efforts that show strong promise or when circumstances evolve. We can only have such optionalities if we have built up our capabilities and talent intentionally. I must also explain that in making such decisions, we do not just rely on our own expertise. Because in many of these emerging fields, we may not have all the expertise. This is the reason why NRF and our research institutes make sure that they have extensive global networks with different panels of advisors that can give us their different perspectives for us to make a considered decision. We have different councils comprising both local and foreign experts in different fields to give us the advice that we need.</p><p>8. Quantum research is an example where we are doubling down after seeing initial promise.</p><p>9.Ms He asked about possible technical approaches, including our current areas of focus, as well as industry development efforts to build our quantum capabilities.</p><p>10. Indeed, this domain is nascent and dynamic. We will continue to adjust where needed and make judgements taking into account the evolving landscape, our capabilities, what we have achieved and what others have achieved. Also, we keep a keen eye on where others are investing in so that we can focus on the areas where we will have a competitive advantage.</p><p>11. I would also like to assure members that the key Government agencies and research offices are keeping a close watch on all of these internal and external developments in consultation with both our local and international scientific panels, and we are not wedded to any focal areas or approaches. But what we must do carefully is to build up capabilities to allow us to have the suite of optionalities to pivot or double down as the circumstances evolve.</p><p>12. As for Ms He's suggestions, we will be happy to take into account her suggestions, and if she has scientific papers that she feels will benefit our considerations, we welcome her to let us know and we will convey this to NRF and our panel of scientific advisors to take a look at this.</p><p>13. More important than just building our own talent pool and expertise, we must also grow our ecosystem of research institutes, industries and workforce. When we say this, I don't just mean growing the capabilities in-house or only in this country. Very often in today's research and development environment, we will need to leverage on the networks that we are able to have access to in the global environment. No one country, not even the biggest countries such as India, China or US, will work alone necessarily, in many of these cutting-edge areas. And working together is what we are committed to do. In a more fragmented world, we must also ride on the opportunity for us to play the role of bringing people from different backgrounds together. That is one area of our competitive advantage. This will then position Singapore strategically to contribute where we can and take advantage of the opportunities, be it in quantum technologies or other areas.</p><p>14. Now let me now address Ms Hazel Poa's cut on behalf of the Prime Minister, on the terms of reference of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC).</p><p>15. Ms Poa would agree with us that there will be an asymptotical limit to asking EBRC to keep reducing the average size of Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) - that limit being one where all electoral divisions are Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). The current terms of reference provide some stability in our electoral landscape by having a balance in the proportion of GRCs and SMCs. Having Members of Parliament (MPs) serving a broadly similar number of electors on average as the last election will enable MPs in the coming Parliament to continue to serve and represent their residents effectively. This last point is what matters most.</p><p>16. As for greater transparency for its recommendations, we discussed this extensively during the debate on the Motion that Ms Poa and Mr Leong Mun Wai tabled in Parliament last August. We do not intend to repeat the debate today. Suffice to say that we should avoid imposing requirements or instructions on the EBRC that are too prescriptive, but to give EBRC, which comprises senior civil servants with the relevant professional knowledge and expertise, the space to do their work independently and objectively, without fear or favour.</p><p>17. Next, Mr Melvin Yong asked how we would prepare the Public Service workforce to tackle the multi-faceted challenges of the future.</p><p>18. Our Public Service has achieved much for Singapore and Singaporeans since 1965.</p><p>a. Today, we are known for our efficiency, innovation and ethos - from meritocracy to incorruptibility. For example, Singapore has been ranked within the top five in the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators on Government Effectiveness since 2014, and topped Oxford University's inaugural Blavatnik Index of Public Administration in 2024.</p><p>b. Having said that, we are not complacent and must not be complacent. Our world is changing rapidly.</p><p>(1) The once familiar rules-based international security and economic orders are fracturing.</p><p>(2) Achieving survival and success for Singapore and Singaporeans will require fresh approaches in the way we do things, not just internally, but also in how we connect with the world.</p><p>c. Our people's aspirations, as Mr Yip Won Heng has shared, have also changed. They have gone up, while our manpower resource base remains tight.</p><p>(1)We will need to constantly review the way we build capabilities, execute and deliver.</p><p>19. The Public Service will focus on strengthening three areas this year:</p><p>a.  First, we must deepen our perspectives of the world and strengthen linkages with partners beyond our Public Service.</p><p>(1) Public service delivery does not happen in a vacuum, nor does it only depend on us looking inward at our own issues.</p><p>(2) As Mr Saktiandi Supaat mentioned, for Singapore to remain successful, our Public Service must deeply appreciate the fast-evolving external context which we have to operate in. We must remain engaged with our international counterparts through active participation in international forums, exchange and training programmes. We must keep in close touch with what is happening in many international agencies. Because the decisions made there can have significant impact on what we can or cannot do, even in our domestic context.</p><p>(3) This is why we will continue to send our officers to many of these international organisations for us to touch base with the latest thinking, and build those networks that are necessary for our continued survival and success. We aspire to send more officers beyond the Public Service and beyond Singapore to understand and build those linkages to further the cause for Singapore and Singaporeans. As an example, National Environment Agency (NEA) officer Khairunnisa Binte Yahya has first-hand experience of this. She is attached to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as an Air Pollution Expert. She shares expertise and develops solutions for air pollution with UNDP partners, enhancing Singapore's global partnerships in environmental sustainability and climate resilience. Khairunnisa has gained insights into UNDP's strategies which informs our efforts to improve Singapore's air quality. More importantly, she has built up a network which she can call upon in time to come.</p><p>(4) As we prepare our officers for an increasingly complex environment, Mr Patrick Tay asked about our efforts to prepare officers for lengthened career spans. We have introduced a Public Service Career Coach Network and will be ramping up our CareerFitness programme to empower officers to build career resilience and agility across different life stages. One such officer is Latha Nadarajan. A Personal Assistant at the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), she pursued her passion for social work by obtaining a Singapore University of Social Sciences degree. After attending a CareerFitness workshop in 2023, she is now set for an attachment with Child Protection Services to apply her new skills. To further reap the career longevity dividend, we will continue to tap on the Public Service Retirees Network, which provides job and volunteer opportunities, to harness their wealth of experiences and add resilience to our system.</p><p>b. Second, and in response to Mr Yip Hon Weng's question on coordinated citizen services, we will continue to integrate our service delivery from a citizen-centric perspective, rather than a silo-Ministry perspective.</p><p>(1) For example, our ServiceSG omni-channel strategy is not just about bringing different services together. It is about how we rewire our processes to deliver services more efficiently, and yet be more aligned with the way our people expect their service journey to be.</p><p>(2) As we continue to streamline and digitalise our services, we will certainly not leave those less digitally savvy behind.</p><p>(3) This requires a mindset shift from a Ministry or agency-centricity to a people-centricity and whole of government perspective. It is a digital-first but not digital-only service that we are aiming for.</p><p>c. Third, we must strengthen team development for a more complex and challenging operating environment. In the Public Service, we have always focused on the development of an individual and this remains valid. Moving forward, we will need to go beyond developing individuals and strengthen the way we develop teams and compose them with diverse abilities, backgrounds and perspectives.</p><p>(1) Our ability to compose teams with diverse abilities to resolve and pre-empt problems is critical as challenges become more complex and interlinked.</p><p>(2)To this end, our Civil Service College will lean forward to help different agencies to build stronger and more agile leadership teams to bring out the best in our agencies to enable Singapore and Singaporeans' success.</p><p>20. To recap, there are three things we will need to focus on urgently this year.</p><p>a. First, for our Public Service to maintain that sense of perspective, to not just be able to understand our own challenges deeply but to have a view of how the world is evolving; because the rules are changing fast. Unless we are plugged in, we might be overtaken or bypassed by rules that are made beyond our shores.</p><p>b. Second, we will continue to focus our efforts to wrap services around citizens. We aim for a more seamless service experience for all Singaporeans.</p><p>c. Third, beyond building the individual, we must build our teams, to have different perspectives, to be able to see things from different angles, so that we can have more robust solutions. We need teams with the courage and the know-how to pivot and change course when the need arises, to pre-empt problems.</p><p>21. Chairman, we do not take for granted that our strong track record will naturally enable our success tomorrow.</p><p>a. Indeed, we believe as a Public Service that we should be continuously vigilant to our fast-changing world order and domestic expectations and constantly challenge ourselves to evolve faster. It is not just about solving today's problems better, but about anticipating tomorrow's challenges earlier, to find those solutions before the problem arises. Only then can we be more assured that we are able to overcome tomorrow's challenges, seize new opportunities to benefit all Singaporeans - and be a Public Service that can continue to be the pride of Singaporeans.</p><p>b. To be successful, we must maintain a strong, continuous and consistent partnership between the political leadership and the Public Service, that allows our Public Service to execute with consistency and conviction, without fear or favour.</p><p>c. This is perhaps something that we have taken for granted. In many countries, they too have people in the Public Service with strong convictions and good ideas, but they do not necessarily have the ability to do this well. This is something that we have, something we cherish, and a competitive advantage for Singapore.</p><p>22. Chair, I have shared how we will deepen our external linkages, deliver integrated services and strengthen our teams. If we do this well, I am confident that this will be a Public Service that we can all be proud of and that will partner us to SG100 and beyond.</p><p>[Category: Events]</p><p>Source: Public Service Division,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["As an example, National Environment Agency (NEA) officer Khairunnisa Binte Yahya has first-hand experience of this.

I will speak on our approach to strengthen our food resilience, and safeguard our hawker culture.</p><p>Strengthening Our Food Resilience</p><p>2. As a country that imports over 90% of our food, Singapore will not be spared from global food supply disruptions. These can arise from disease outbreaks, climate change, and geopolitical tensions.</p><p>Diversifying Our Import Sources</p><p>3. In safeguarding our food resilience, diversifying our import sources remains our core strategy.</p><p>4. Today, we import from 187 countries, up from just 140 around two decades back.</p><p>5. When accrediting food imports, SFA takes a risk-based approach. While products with low food safety risks do not require accreditation, SFA accredits higher-risk food products like meat and egg products, in line with international practice.</p><p>6. Since December 2024, SFA has streamlined this process in line with the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, by accrediting at a broader food category level instead of by food product.</p><p>7. This expands our import product range, and improves business efficiency.</p><p>Stockpiling Essential Items</p><p>8. But our food resilience cannot and does not hinge on one single strategy; it requires a multi-pronged approach.</p><p>9. One complementary strategy is to maintain adequate food stocks to tide over supply disruptions, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, stockpiling alone is insufficient. For perishable essentials like fibre, long-term storage is challenging, involving inventory and logistics costs.</p><p>Growing Local</p><p>10. This is why we develop some capacity and capability for local production. It complements our diversification and stockpiling strategies with a regenerative characteristic, allowing us to continue producing food during supply disruptions.</p><p>11. Ms Nadia Samdinasked about the progress of our \"30 by 30\" vision. Today, less than 10% of the food we consume is produced locally.</p><p>12. When we conceived this vision in 2019, it was aspirational. The agri-food business climate was then more benign, with stronger investor interest, lower interest rates, and lower energy prices. Now, the global food industry outlook has become less favourable, with:</p><p>13. Dwindling investments in urban agri-food technology and alternative proteins, and</p><p>14. Geopolitical tensions exacerbating uncertainties around energy costs.</p><p>15. Local farms will continue facing inherent structural challenges, in this early stage when their production facilities have yet to achieve sufficient scale.</p><p>16. A key challenge is high production costs in Singapore, given limited land and a tight labour force.</p><p>17. This is exacerbated by strong price competition from imported produce, which enjoy lower production costs.</p><p>18. For our farms to scale, we need to help them improve productivity and lower costs, while increasing consumer demand for local produce. Navigating these complex issues will require time, effort and close partnership across the Government, our industry and consumers.</p><p>19. Despite these challenges, our capacity and capability to produce food locally has grown, and some food types have shown early successes.</p><p>20. Locally-produced hen eggs and beansprouts now contribute 30% and 50% of our local consumption respectively.</p><p>21. SFA is continuously assessing our progress and our initiatives' relevance in growing our agri-food sector, gaining experience along the way.</p><p>22. Ms Samdinasked whether we are reviewing Singapore's 30-by-30 goal. Indeed, we are reviewing our local production strategy to be more focused and targeted in addressing key challenges of productivity, costs and demand, and in fostering the sector's continued growth. We will share more details after our review.</p><p>Singapore Aquaculture Plan</p><p>23. Ms Samdinasked about the initiatives announced in theSingaporeAquaculture Plan, which we refreshed last year, bringing stakeholders together to chart a shared roadmap to uplift our aquaculture sector.</p><p>24. Under the plan, we are spearheading efforts to strengthen the supply resilience of agri-inputs, which are vital for farms.</p><p>25. In aquaculture, agri-inputs constitute up to 60% of farms' production costs.</p><p>26. Quality eggs and fingerlings form a key priority. However, with the inconsistent quality our farmers use today, fish mortalities can go up to 80%, impacting downstream yield.</p><p>27. The newly-establishedNational Broodstock Centre(or NBC)andHatchery Development and Recognition Programmewill supply to our farms genetically superior eggs and fingerlings, with higher survival and grow-out rates.</p><p>28. SFA will work with local hatcheries to uplift their capabilities and gain accreditation under the programme, which allows them to access superior fish eggs from the NBC.</p><p>29. The programme will first focus on Asian seabass - commonly produced and consumed by Singaporeans. SFA is in the process of training and accrediting a few seabass hatcheries.</p><p>30. SFA's work is also underway to study potential sites for the hybrid sea farming model, in close consultation with Government agencies, the industry, researchers and nature groups.</p><p>31. Identifying and allocating appropriate sites is not easy. It demands significant time and resources, given our limited sea space, competing uses, and needing to mitigate environmental impact.</p><p>32. Broadly, we will continue to avail space for farming by launching land and sea tenders progressively. SFA will announce tender details along the way.</p><p>33. ToMs Samdin's question on keeping our marine environment clean, let me explain that all farms are required by licence to maintain clean and sanitary conditions.</p><p>34. With the Farm Management Plan, introduced under the Food Safety and Security Act passed in Parliament this January, we also require licensees undertaking primary production activities to adopt means to mitigate food safety risks, disease spread and ensure sustainable production.</p><p>Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund</p><p>35. To support our farms to be more productive and climate-resilient, SFA provides funding through theAgri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund, or ACT Fund.</p><p>36. To addressMr Shawn HuangandMr Dennis Tan's questions, the ACT Fund supports farms to adopt farming solutions for diverse needs, from small-scale trials to larger commercial systems, with over $28 million awarded to 43 companies by end-2024.</p><p>37. Each application proposal is assessed holistically, considering its merits and ability to contribute to our food resilience.</p><p>38. One example is Blue Ocean Aquaculture Technology. Supported by an earlier iteration of the ACT Fund, they developed an indoor recirculating aquaculture system to farm various fish species in higher densities, with a lower footprint, and regardless of climate or external environmental changes.</p><p>39. Another example, Yili Farm, has also benefitted from funding to construct an intensive soil and hydroponics farming system, achieving resource efficiencies.</p><p>40. Mr Tanraised some suggestions on adopting permaculture principles and deploying natural solutions like aquatic plants, to improve climate resilience.</p><p>41. Permaculture, in particular, tends to require extensive land space, which might not be as well-suited for local production in Singapore.</p><p>42. Nonetheless, farms should assess the farming methods and solutions most appropriate for their operating model and constraints, accounting for the need to be commercially viable, climate-resilient and resource-efficient.</p><p>43. Generally, SFA provides technical resources on agriculture technologies, and have account managers who can further assist and advise farmers on growth areas and development plans.</p><p>44. To better address our farmers' diverse and emerging needs, SFA has enhanced the ACT Fund, incorporating their feedback.</p><p>45. The enhancements will provide farms with:</p><p>46. More comprehensive coverage, to include expenses such as marketing and branding; and</p><p>47. Expanded funding scope to cover standalone pre- and post-harvest production facilities.</p><p>48. To provide farms more time to harness technology and innovation, SFA will also extend the maximum project funding duration from 27 to 36 months.</p><p>49. AsMs Rachel Onghighlighted, local businesses seeking to innovate may need grants and other support, beyond research grants. Agri-food businesses can also access Enterprise SG's initiatives like the Enterprise Development Grant and Startup SG, which finance innovation projects and capabilities.</p><p>Growing Demand Offtake for Local Produce</p><p>50. For our farms to achieve scale, they also need sustained demand. This is where strong support from the industry and consumers can help strengthen our Singapore Food Story.</p><p>51. Under our Alliance for Action to encourage increased offtake for local produce, the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprise Federation (or SAFEF) is expanding its work as a supply and demand aggregator.</p><p>52. In May 2024, SAFEF launched the \"SG Farmers' Market\"and\"The Straits Fish\"product lines in selected FairPrice outlets, aggregating locally-farmed vegetables and marine tilapia respectively to make them more accessible to consumers, especially those in the heartlands.</p><p>53. By last month, sales have increased about fivefold for local xiao bai cai, and twofold for processed local fish products. I am very heartened by the public response.</p><p>54. SAFEF is working with our farmers and industry partners to launch even more products. Beyond FairPrice outlets, consumers can also find \"SG Farmers' Market\" vegetables at Sheng Siong supermarkets starting this month.</p><p>55. More food businesses are recognised under theFarm-to-Table Recognition Programme, for their commitment to procure locally produced, locally-farmed ingredients.</p><p>56. Since launching in 2023, membership has grown steadily to 101 establishments by January this year.</p><p>57. SFA will continue to encourage morebusinesses to come onboard.</p><p>Safeguarding Our Hawker Culture</p><p>58. Let me now shift gears to another food-related topic. With SG60, we also mark the fifth year of the inscription of Singapore's hawker culture onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Our hawker centres form the heart of our hawker culture.</p><p>Upgrading and Building Our Hawker Centre</p><p>59. Minister Grace Fu explained why we must look ahead to update our hawker centre landscape. This builds on our progress thus far.</p><p>60. In the 2010s, we restarted building 20 new hawker centres after a hiatus to address Singaporeans' needs in estates under-served by food &amp; beverage options. Today, 14 are in operation.</p><p>61. I am also pleased to announce that 2 new hawker centres are opening in the first half of this year.</p><p>62. Bukit Batok West Hawker Centre will feature 22 cooked food stalls and over 400 seats, while Punggol Coast Hawker Centre will introduce 40 stalls and over 680 seats.</p><p>63. Both are designed for a pleasant dining environment, featuring high ceilings with improved ventilation, spacious seating areas and connectivity to surrounding facilities.</p><p>64. As we progressively complete the remaining centres in upcoming years, we are also looking beyond that.We plan to build another 5 new hawker centres to ensure more residents in under-served estates can access affordable and delicious hawker food.NEA will announce more details when ready.</p><p>65. Besides building new hawker centres, we have invested in upgrading our existing infrastructure, in addition to cyclical renovation works.</p><p>66. We last embarked on a nationwideHawker Centres Upgrading Programme, or HUP, over 20 years ago to upgrade or rebuild almost 100 centres.</p><p>67. More recently, we piloted theHawker Centres Transformation Programmeat two centres in Cheng San and Geylang Serai to improve hygiene conditions and address persistent infrastructural concerns. I am glad thatMs Samdinfound it helpful, through works like improving seating layout to minimise crowding and enhancing ventilation with new fittings.</p><p>68. The experiences we gained will inform our next bound, under HUP 2.0. As outlined by Minister Grace Fu,HUP 2.0seeks to meet Singaporeans' evolving needs by upgrading older hawker centres, or rebuilding for some, into more vibrant, accessible and climate-resilient spaces.</p><p>69. Upgrading and building hawker centres are extensive endeavours that we are planning ahead and implementing progressively for the next 20 to 30 years.</p><p>70. ToMs Hany Soh'squestion, NEA is working closely with other agencies to dovetail with estate development plans and ensure local communities' needs are well-served.</p><p>71. We will carefully examine our options and share more details when ready.</p><p>72. Mr Pritam Singhasked about the future of markets.</p><p>73. Of the over 7,000 such stalls in 83 markets managed under NEA, occupancy rates remained relatively stable at around 96% in recent years.</p><p>74. Nonetheless, consumer patterns have shifted with changing demographics and availability of alternatives like supermarkets and online retailers. NEA will assess local community needs and the availability of market produce, to determine the development plans of wet markets under HUP 2.0.</p><p>Supporting our Hawker Trade and Culture</p><p>75. Beyond the physical space, our hawker centres are also about our hawkers who, as masters of their craft, are the heart and soul of our hawker centres.</p><p>76. In commemoration of SG60 and to appreciate our hawkers, the Minister for Finance has announced a one-time rental support of $600 this year, for each stall in hawker centres and markets managed by the Government and Government-appointed operators.</p><p>77. As a nation, we share a joint responsibility to ensure that our hawker culture continues to thrive. The Government will lead by setting policies to support and sustain the hawker trade. This includes providing a conducive business environment, ensuring the trade remains attractive, and nurturing a new generation of hawkers.</p><p>78. ToMr Eric ChuaandMs Samdin'squestions,indeed,as circumstances change, we need to review and adjust our policies.</p><p>79. For instance, we saw the need to discourage excessively high tender bids for NEA-managed hawker centre stalls. Hence, we recently extended the duration for decreasing monthly stall rent from the bid price to assessed market rate after the initial tenancy period, by one more tenancy term.</p><p>80. As we monitor outcomes, we are concurrently taking steps to encourage more informed and realistic bidding.</p><p>81. To guide tenderers, NEA now shares the median assessed market rent for centres with vacant stalls, in NEA's tender exercises since last month.</p><p>82. NEA will also launch an online self-help tool, which can help tenderers understand the costs involved in running a hawker stall.</p><p>83. We also recognise hawkers' challenges in hiring stall assistants. Since January this year, we relaxed our manpower policy for hawker centres managed by NEA and NEA-appointed operators, and are monitoring the impact.</p><p>84. Enhancing productivity is another sustainable approach to manage manpower constraints, and where we can leverage on technology asMr Chuasuggests.</p><p>85. For example, centralised dishwashing and cleaning process automation like tray conveyance systems can improve centre-wide productivity, and are supported under NEA's Productive Hawker Centres programme.</p><p>86. Also, under NEA's Hawkers' Productivity Grant, we have disbursed over $3.4 million by end-2024 to co-fund hawkers in adopting stall-level automation equipment and digital solutions, like e-ordering and kitchen management systems.</p><p>87. We will continue identifying and supporting practical technologies that can alleviate hawkers' challenges.</p><p>88. Mr Chuaalso suggested a two-shift system to optimise stall utility. Hawkers can already do this today through NEA's Joint Operator Scheme, which allows eligible stallholders and their appointed joint operators to share stall operating hours without overlapping.</p><p>89. While I am glad that some hawkers have benefitted from this scheme, we acknowledge that such a scheme may be operationally difficult to accommodate for other hawkers depending on their business models.</p><p>90. We will continue to assess our policies to assist our hawkers and ensure alignment with operating realities.</p><p>91. We also support aspiring hawkers to boost their chances of success.</p><p>92. NEA does this through the Incubation Stall Programme, Hawkers' Development Programme, and Hawkers Succession Scheme.</p><p>93. Ms Samdinwould be glad that by end-2024,</p><p>94. Over 100 aspiring hawkers have moved on to complete apprenticeships under hawker mentors.</p><p>95. NEA has also allocated near 100 pre-fitted incubation stalls with reduced rent, to help aspiring hawkers kickstart their business.</p><p>96. Our hawker landscape will continue evolving with the times. We will continue to review our policies and support programmes, to ensure they can meet the interests of Singaporeans, our hawkers and other stakeholders, amid changing needs and expectations.</p><p>[Category: Food, Packaged Foods &amp; Meats, Regulatory and Legal, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Another example, Yili Farm, has also benefitted from funding to construct an intensive soil and hydroponics farming system, achieving resource efficiencies. 40. 41.

As we mark SG60, looking back at the last sixty years, it is not difficult to note the progress we have made since independence.</p><p>2. We laid the foundations for a modern metropolis, cleaning up our waterways and environment, putting in place a modern sanitation system, reducing flood risks, and improving food safety.</p><p>3. Our hawker centres remain an important source of affordable food, a cherished social space for many Singaporeans, and a proud showcase of our food heritage for friends visiting from abroad.</p><p>4. We have also harnessed science and technology through NEWater and desalination to strengthen our water resilience, and developed Project Wolbachia to fight dengue and improve public health.</p><p>5. The green and livable city we enjoy today is the collective result of our boldness and our resilience over the past six decades.</p><p>6. Since our independence, we have pursued economic growth in tandem with environmental protection and social inclusion. It is a careful balancing act - one that requires boldness in decision-making and the resilience to rise above our constraints.</p><p>7. MSE's work is vital in safeguarding the food we eat, the water we drink, and the environment we live, work and play in. At the core, MSE's work is about \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday.\"</p><p>8. Our Sustainability - is to steward our limited resources responsibly for future generations; and</p><p>9. Our Resilience - is to prepare for and adapt to new challenges; and</p><p>10. Our Everyday - is to improve the daily living of Singaporeans, and our daily interaction with our environment, present and future.</p><p>11. In this COS debate, we will touch on these areas.</p><p>Our Sustainability</p><p>12. First, our sustainability.</p><p>13. Improving energy efficiency is critical in our drive towards net zero. Everyone can play a part in improving our energy efficiency. Being more energy efficient will help us conserve energy, allowing us to grow our economy and population with less energy and carbon emission.</p><p>14. We will support households and industries in pursuing energy efficiency improvements.</p><p>15. For businesses, we have expanded energy efficiency grants to cover more sectors such as construction and manufacturing sectors. We have also enhanced regulatory frameworks for various sectors, such as the buildings and industry sectors.</p><p>16. For households, the enhanced Climate Friendly Households Programme will be expanded to benefit more households and encourage wider adoption of resource efficient household products.</p><p>17. The public sector is also pressing ahead with its plan to improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. SMS Khor will share more.</p><p>18. Ms Poh Li San asked how we intend to manage air conditioning use. Against the backdrop of a warmer planet, it is crucial that we manage our thermal comfort sustainably. Very often, our indoor spaces are so cold that we need to wear sweaters in tropical Singapore.</p><p>19. A major step is to keep indoor air-conditioned spaces at 25C or higher. This will reduce energy cost and allow occupants to dress more appropriately for our tropical climate.</p><p>20. The public sector has adopted this where possible, and we hope to partner businesses and the public to make a broader shift towards sustainable cooling. More details will be announced later this year.</p><p>Our Resilience</p><p>21. Next, our resilience efforts.</p><p>22. Climate change poses a serious and considerable threat to Singapore.</p><p>23. We will launch a $25 million Weather Science Research Programme to enhance Singapore's ability to understand and predict our tropical urban weather, including extreme weather arising from climate change.</p><p>24. Under this programme, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore will collaborate with local Institutes of Higher Learning and Research Institutes to incorporate the latest scientific and technological developments.</p><p>25. For example, researchers will use artificial intelligence to improve our ability to forecast.</p><p>26. Just as we have risen to past challenges, we need to work together with purpose, urgency and determination to strengthen our climate resilience. I will speak about flood, coastal and heat resilience, while SMS Khor and SMS Koh will cover water and food resilience respectively.</p><p>Flood &amp; Coastal resilience</p><p>27. First, flood and coastal resilience. In our early days of independence, Singapore faced frequent and widespread flooding during the monsoon seasons. Over the years, we have reduced flood prone areas from around 3,200 hectares in the 1970s to less than 25 hectares today - which is a 99% reduction. You may recall that in January this year, Singapore experienced two monsoon surges which brought prolonged rain. Over both monsoon surges, there was just one reported flood incident. Our progress in flood resilience is significant.</p><p>28. However, climate change will pose new challenges. As such, we will upgrade our infrastructure to enhance Singapore's flood resilience.</p><p>29. We can expect six more drainage upgrading projects this year. Later this year, upgrading works for the Sungei Serangoon Western and Eastern subsidiary drains are slated to commence, to cater for upcoming developments in the Lorong Halus area.</p><p>30. That said, in land-scarce Singapore, we cannot keep expanding our drainage infrastructure. We must strengthen flood resilience at the systems level, and partner building owners, developers, and the wider community.</p><p>31. For individual developments, PUB works closely with building owners and developers to implement, operate and maintain flood-protection measures. For underground MRT stations and buildings with basements, PUB works with them to meet requirements on minimum platform and crest levels.</p><p>32. PUB also engages residents and businesses in flood-prone areas and hotspots on flood risks and distributes flood protection devices to enhance flood protection for these premises.</p><p>33. To improve rainfall monitoring and prediction, PUB leverages and has invested in technology like X-band radars to give more localised forecasts. To update Singaporeans on potential flooding, PUB leverages the myENV mobile app, social media, radio broadcast and traditional media outlets to disseminate timely updates. There are also plans to enable the ERP 2.0 on-board units to display flood alerts by mid-2025.</p><p>34. As we enhance our inland flood resilience, we need to build coastal protection in tandem.</p><p>35. Members asked about the status of our coastal protection plans, legislation and standards. To guide our plans, we are conducting site-specific studies. The studies for Jurong Island, City-East Coast, including Long Island, as well as the northwest coast from Tuas to Woodlands are on track. More details for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Changi will be shared later this year. We will commence the studies for Sentosa and the south-west coast by 2026.</p><p>36. Ms Nadia also asked how we will fund our coastal protection efforts. The Government plans to use funds from our annual Budget, the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, to which the Minister for Finance has announced a $5 billion top-up, and through borrowing. Where eligible, such as for land reclamation costs, we will also use the Past Reserves. We will continue to study how best to finance these measures in a way that is fiscally sustainable and equitable across generations.</p><p>37. It is more effective to build up flood resilience at a system's level, where coastal stakeholders play their part alongside the Government.We are preparing a coastal protection legislation to set out the responsibilities of relevant stakeholders, safeguard land for coastal protection measures and ensure that coastal protection standards are met. We will consult stakeholders and table a Coastal Protection bill in the second half of 2025.</p><p>38. PUB is developing a Code of Practice that will provide a set of design standards, as well as operation and maintenance requirements for coastal protection measures. We will consult the industry this year, and aim to release it by the first half of 2026.</p><p>39. PUB will also launch a Flood-Resilient Developments guidebook to help building owners enhance the resilience of their premises. The guidebook will contain case studies and a toolkit of flood-resilient measures that owners can consider adopting for their buildings.</p><p>Heat resilience</p><p>40. Next, on heat resilience.</p><p>41. As we experience rising temperatures, building heat resilience is a critical part of our adaptation efforts. Ms Poh Li San asked about our heat resilience efforts.</p><p>42. We are progressively rolling out infrastructural interventions to enhance heat resilience.</p><p>43. HDB will work closely with the Town Councils to apply cool coatings to all existing HDB estates islandwide by 2030.</p><p>44. We are studying the effectiveness of cool coatings to other infrastructure archetypes, such as schools and hawker centres.</p><p>45. We will find ways to improve thermal comfort for the public, such as enhancing greenery and ventilation, and reducing heat emission.</p><p>46. Infrastructural interventions, however, need to be complemented with individual actions. Thermal comfort is subjective, and our bodies respond differently.</p><p>47. A key tenet of our heat resilience efforts is about empowering people.</p><p>48. The Heat Stress Advisory was launched in 2023 to guide the public on steps to protect themselves, based on the prevailing heat stress levels. Recognising that heat affects various groups of people differently, depending on the nature of their activities, the Heat Stress Advisory is supported by sector-specific guidelines, such as the Ministry of Manpower's revised framework to protect outdoor workers.</p><p>49. Underpinning these guidelines is our Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature heat stress sensor network. I am happy to share that we are expanding our sensor network beyond sports stadiums to cover residential areas. This will provide more accurate information so that our advisory can be more effective.</p><p>50. The expanded heat stress sensor network will also provide more timely information on extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. We have developed heatwave response plans for both public and sector-specific populations.</p><p>51. Associate Professor Razwana asked about our collaboration with partners. We do so through platforms such as the C40 network of about 100 cities that are looking for solutions on climate change. We also partner researchers to deepen our understanding of how heat impacts our health, and to co-create innovative solutions such as developing wearables for better heat stress monitoring.</p><p>52. I have touched on our efforts for flood, coastal and heat resilience. These are important parts of Singapore's national adaptation plan, which countries are encouraged to develop in line with international best practices. In the face of increasing yet uncertain climate risks, the national adaptation plan will serve as a long-term, living strategy for Singapore to continue thriving in the future. Through our ongoing and upcoming engagements, we hope to hear views from the community and stakeholders too.</p><p>Our Everyday</p><p>53. Lastly, our efforts to safeguard our everyday.</p><p>54. The journey towards a sustainable and resilient Singapore is not just about preparing for the longer-term challenges. We must not lose sight of the importance of our everyday behaviour.</p><p>Public hygiene</p><p>55. This was why we designated 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene. To highlight the importance of public hygiene and more importantly, to harness the spirit of collective responsibility in adopting good public hygiene practices for the betterment of our society.</p><p>56. We have achieved commendable outcomes.</p><p>57. We saw a 36% reduction of litter between May 2024 and Dec 2024 at littering hotspots, thanks to increased public education as well as enforcement efforts.</p><p>58. My Ministry also recently received the Public Toilets Taskforce's report. We have studied the taskforce's recommendations and decided to endorse them.</p><p>59. SPS Baey will share more on this.</p><p>Hawker centres</p><p>60. Hawker centres are also an important part of our everyday.</p><p>61. In the early days, street hawkers were resettled into hawker centres to improve food hygiene standards and public health.</p><p>62. Hawker centres have remained an important source of affordable food and an integral part of our culture, serving as vibrant community dining rooms for Singaporeans and visitors from all walks of life.</p><p>63. Over time, as our people's needs evolve, our hawker centres have to be revitalised and be future ready.</p><p>64. With climate change, an ageing population, rapid urban redevelopments, and shifting hawker profiles, patrons and hawkers have new expectations. Hawkers also require more productive and innovative solutions to meet their business aspirations and tackle operational challenges.</p><p>65. As demographics shift, some hawker centres in the mature estates have experienced falling demand. At the same time, new estates have emerged, and may need more affordable eating options.</p><p>66. The Minister for Finance has announced that we will allocate up to $1 billion to upgrade older hawker centres and build new centres. We will do these progressively over the next 20 to 30 years, to serve the changing needs of Singaporeans for generations to come.</p><p>67. New hawker centres will be built as needed, with modern services and sustainable spaces.</p><p>68. Under a new Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme 2.0, or HUP 2.0 for short, existing hawker centres will be transformed. Madam, in Mandarin.</p><p>69. Through the Hawker Centre Renovation Plus, we will create a more comfortable dining and working environment for diners and hawkers. We hope to provide more inclusive spaces to ensure that everyone, including the elderly and the disabled, can access the convenience of hawker centres. The infrastructure of hawker centres will also be prepared for climate change.</p><p>70. Some hawker centres located in mature HDB estates may undergo larger-scale reconstruction. We will try to synchronize the development plans with the HDB estates as much as possible, keep pace with the times, and build hawker centres that are more comfortable and better suited to the needs of the public.</p><p>71. SMS Koh will share more later about our plans.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>72. Let me conclude.</p><p>73. The road ahead will not be easy. We will face challenges that will test our adaptability - climate change, geopolitical tensions, disease outbreaks and other global uncertainties. But our Singapore story has always been one of resilience - of a people who refuse to be daunted by our limitations, who turn challenges into opportunities, and who forge ahead with boldness.</p><p>74. MSE's theme for today's debate is \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday\". It is not just about the policies and infrastructure, but also aboutourpeople and the everyday choices we make. It is about the businesses that embrace green investments and innovation, the households that recycle waste, the individuals who champion sustainability, and the communities that look out for one another.</p><p>75. Every effort, no matter how small, strengthens our resilience and secures our future. Let us build on our strong foundation and press on with boldness and confidence. Just as past generations laid the groundwork for the green and livable Singapore we enjoy today, let us do our part to ensure that future generations will look back with pride at the choices we made.</p><p>76. Together, we can shape a Singapore that remains not only a thriving nation, but also a home that is sustainable, resilient, and full of potential.</p><p>[Category: Water Utilities, Utilities, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["For example, researchers will use artificial intelligence to improve our ability to forecast. 26.

Working Group I deals with the physical science basis of climate change, Working Group II with climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and Working Group III with climate change mitigation. </p><p> Working Group II is split into two offices, one in Singapore and one based in Delft, Netherlands. </p><p> We, in the Singapore-based technical support unit of the IPCC, together with Delft, have been tasked to lead the report and are keen to ensure that this special report is as inclusive as possible. </p><p> That aspiration underpins our aim to actively involve experts, urban practitioners and civil society in developing the report. </p><p> There are multiple opportunities to participate, and we are inviting early-career scientists, urban planners and regional policymakers to contribute insights and perspectives, ensuring that the report reflects the unique challenges and opportunities faced by cities in diverse physical, spatial and social contexts.</p><p> We hope that these efforts will foster a stronger sense of ownership among urban stakeholders in the region and beyond, to ensure that they feel represented by the report, and make its findings more relevant for action.</p><p> A call to action A report that offers solutions is key as we need science to be translated into decisions that can help cities achieve their sustainability targets. </p><p> Cities will not reach their climate goals without the support and active engagement of those who live, work and make decisions within them. </p><p> For policymakers, the responsibility of building sustainable cities lies largely with those who shape policies and allocate resources. </p><p> The special report will encourage policymakers to implement progressive policies that both reduce physical climate risk and promote low-emissions living by default. </p><p> Imagine a city where energy-efficient housing is the standard, public transportation is widely accessible and affordable, and green spaces are integrated into every neighbourhood. Such environments reduce the need for individual emissions-related decisions and make climate-friendly living the norm.</p><p> For urban practitioners, such as architects, engineers and urban planners, and scientists, they have the expertise to reimagine cities in ways that are functional, resilient to climate risk and sustainable in lifestyle. </p><p> The IPCC report will provide these professionals with the scientific evidence needed to design and implement urban infrastructure resilient to heat, droughts, floods and other hazards, ensure energy efficiency and renewable energy, and incorporate nature-based solutions into urban landscapes. </p><p> Cities are made by and for the people who live in them, and urban residents can play a crucial role by supporting sustainable local initiatives, advocating for green policies and making low-carbon choices in their daily lives. </p><p> By sharing regional insights, the special report will provide a toolkit of best practices, showing cities how to tackle climate challenges in ways that resonate with local contexts.</p><p> Now is the time for urban residents, businesses, civil society organisations, policymakers and professionals to get involved. </p><p> For residents, this means staying informed, advocating for policies that prioritise sustainability and participating in local climate initiatives. </p><p> For policymakers and urban practitioners, it means contributing to the report's recommendations to create environments where people and nature can thrive together. </p><p> Ultimately, the cities we shape today will determine the lives we lead tomorrow. </p><p> The IPCC special report on cities is a call to action for all of us to harness the full potential of our cities in the climate fight, ensuring that they are resilient, inclusive and sustainable for generations to come.</p><p> Dr Winston Chow is the co-chair  of Working Group II of the UN's leading climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

But we know that our efforts alone will not be enough,\" said Mr Wong.</p><p> \"The rest of the world must also do their part. Unfortunately, in the short term, many countries are increasing their reliance on fossil fuels to prevent the lights from going out, to provide for energy security,\" he added.</p><p> This means that the world will have to redouble its efforts to get back on track with the plans to keep global temperatures from rising beyond a threshold that will result in irreversible damage, he said. </p><p> The world has already warmed by at least 1.1 deg C, and scientists have warned that global warming must be kept to 1.5 deg C in  order to avert the more catastrophic consequences of climate change. </p><p> \"While we will do our best to shape and drive this international agenda, we must also prepare for the worst,\" he added. </p><p> For instance, the polder which is being built on Pulau Tekong is more than halfway complete and set to be finished by end-2024, said Mr Wong. </p><p> A polder is a low-lying tract of land protected from the sea by structures known as dikes. </p><p> The experience gained from this project will give the country more options to protect its coastline against rising sea levels, he noted.</p><p> In 2020, the Government announced a Coastal and Flood Protection Fund with an initial injection of $5 billion to support the construction of coastal and drainage infrastructure.</p><p> Since then, national water agency PUB has announced it will be conducting eight site-specific studies to enhance drainage infrastructure and come up with coastal protection measures for Singapore's 300km of coastlines. </p><p> Three of the eight studies are currently under way, and a fourth will begin in the latter half of the year.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 44, "title": "UN climate chief renews plea for national plans", "published": "2024-11-20", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">BAKU, Azerbaijan  Every bit of preparation against climate change impacts makes the difference between life and death for millions of people around the world, UN climate chief Simon Stiell stressed. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> His remarks at the UN climate change summit (COP29) in Azerbaijan on Nov 18 come as the Philippines was ravaged by its sixth tropical storm in less than a month. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Super Typhoon Man-yi slammed into highly-populated Luzon on Nov 17, killing at least eight people and triggering landslides, destroying houses and knocking out power lines. The six severe storms have taken more than 160 lives and impacted over 10 million people, and caused damage worth an estimated 470 million pesos (S$10 million). </p><p> Speaking at a high-level event on climate adaptation, Mr Stiell noted that nearly half of the human population live in climate vulnerability hot spots, where people are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. </p><p> \"Personally, I find this deeply disturbing, highly offensive,\" he said. </p><p> Even as he made a renewed plea for countries -- especially the most vulnerable ones -- to start planning for climate change, Mr Stiell called for more innovative financing to channel money to countries that need to build resilience against climate impacts. </p><p> \"We can no longer rely on small streams of finance. We need torrents of funding. They need to be easier to access, especially for the most vulnerable countries that often face the biggest barriers,\" he said. </p><p> Countries previously agreed to have their national adaptation plans ready by 2025, to be implemented by 2030. </p><p> Such plans lay out a country's medium- and long-term solutions to limit the impact of climate change on communities. </p><p> To date, 60 countries -- mostly developing or least developed nations -- have submitted their national plans. South-east Asian countries on the list include Cambodia, Thailand, Timor-Leste and the Philippines. </p><p>Singapore's adaptation efforts are included in its climate targets document, which was last updated in 2022 and submitted to the UN. </p><p> Countries' adaptation costs could rise to US$340 billion (S$456 billion) per year by 2030, reaching as much as US$565 billion per year by 2050, Mr Stiell noted. </p><p> \"The funding exists. We need to unlock and unblock it.\"</p><p> He urged multilateral development banks to think beyond traditional grants and loans, and philanthropies, the private sector and bilateral donors to step up without increasing the debt faced by vulnerable countries. </p><p> \"The people who receive this investment will not disappoint. They want to adapt. Often, they know better than we do just how to adapt,\" he added. </p><p> Adaptation outcomes at COP29 are expected to be closely linked to a new climate finance goal, which will be the summit's primary outcome and define the success of the talks. </p><p> Developing countries are calling for developed nations to commit to US$1.3 trillion per year to help the more vulnerable countries meet their climate targets and adapt to disasters that disproportionately fall on them. </p><p> In its adaptation gap report published in early November, the United Nations Environment Programme found that public finance to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts increased from US$22 billion in 2021 to US$28 billion in 2022. </p><p> But this amount still leaves a huge adaptation finance gap, estimated at between US$187 billion and US$359 billion per year. </p><p> Furthermore, a lack of transparency and accessibility of some countries' climate risks would make the financial system more vulnerable and also hinder access to capital for climate adaptation, said Singapore-based Anjali Viswamohanan, who spoke at the meeting. </p><p> This was a problem highlighted in an analysis of adaptation policies of several Asian markets including China, India and Malaysia published by the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) in November. </p><p> Ms Viswamohanan, director of policy at AIGCC, cited a survey that found that 49 of 52 of the world's largest institutional investors -- managing roughly US$50.2 trillion in Asia -- have policies on climate risks and opportunities. </p><p> \"This means that a large number of financial institutions understand that climate risk is a financial risk and would be keen to see clear plans from policymakers to address these risks that private capital can contribute to,\" she told ST. </p><p> \"(But) if there is a misalignment (between the private sector and country) of what the risks are, you're not going to align on the type of financing, the type of projects that's required... you will not actually get projects that are investable.\"</p><p> Neighbouring countries also need to consider transboundary climate impacts such as air pollution or haze, and water shortage from a drought, she noted. </p><p> \"But several countries are not adequately thinking about or coordinating on these risks. We found very little concrete information on that in their adaptation plans,\" she added. </p><p> Beyond having a national plan in place, the local communities need to be the ones leading the projects, since every island or province faces differing climate impacts, noted Ms Maheen Khan, an international climate resilience adviser at WWF-Netherlands. She was speaking at a press conference by the World Wide Fund for Nature on the morning of Nov 18 at the summit. </p><p> \"Adaptation is local.

In comparison, groupings like Asean are defined geographically, while the United Nations covers all the countries in the world.</p><p> The Commonwealth is somewhere in between on this spectrum. Amid its diversity, it possesses certain advantages derived from a common heritage, such as the use of the English language and similar legal systems, said PM Wong.</p><p> Despite the other Commonwealth countries being at different levels of development, Singapore can learn from all of them, added PM Wong, who arrived in Samoa on Oct 23 for his first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). </p><p> One key area is climate change. Given that extreme weather and rising sea levels are a \"wipe-out risk\" for a number of Pacific and Caribbean member states, PM Wong noted that many of them are pressing forward on things like carbon mitigation, carbon capture, new renewable energies and green hydrogen.</p><p> \"These are areas where we can exchange notes, even learn from some of their best practices and also find new areas for cooperation. So that's just one example,\" he said.</p><p> Within the Commonwealth, apart from exchanging best practices and supporting the states at risk, there has been some attempt to mobilise funds towards climate action, added PM Wong. </p><p> He also pointed to the Commonwealth Ocean Declaration launched at the end of CHOGM, where member countries committed to preserving and protecting the oceans, and to cooperating around the blue economy.</p><p> During the CHOGM discussions, various leaders spoke about ways to use the grouping's commonality to strengthen their countries' links, such as in trade and investment and ease of doing business, to emerge as a stronger bloc of countries.</p><p> PM Wong said there is a lot of benefit in doing so, and Singapore will certainly support the grouping's efforts to find new ways of working together and enhancing links.</p><p> The summit was also an opportunity for him to spend \"a lot of time\" engaging Pacific island, Caribbean and African countries, he added.

This year, Ravi Menon, former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), opened the conference with a keynote address on the Global Finance and Technology Network (GFTN), a new initiative aimed at expanding the SFF beyond its role as a global forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GFTN will replace Elevandi, which was established in 2021 to \"expand and organise\" the SFF. Menon was announced as the GFTN's chairman on Oct 30, and the MAS's current fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, will join as the group's CEO.</p><p>Menon says there are three key reasons for the formation of GFTN. First is the emergence of new technologies such as asset tokenisation, climate tech, AI and quantum computing, which are progressing rapidly in the financial services industry. This leads to the need for more coherent policies and practices to harness their benefits better and manage their risks, he adds.</p><p>Amid current geopolitical challenges, global platforms and safe spaces are also needed to promote collaboration and achieve common goals. GFTN, a non-state, not-for-profit organisation, aims to be such a platform, says Menon. Despite the growing innovation in the global south, critical gaps in talent, infrastructure, capital and policy must also be addressed in a coordinated manner.</p><p>The GFTN will have four key strategic businesses: forums, advisory, platforms and capital. For its first line of business, GFTN seeks to develop a globally distributed, partnership-driven network of fintech forms. This will be done by sharpening the focus of Elevandi's five existing forums: the Japan Fintech Festival in Tokyo, the Point Zero Forum in Zurich, the Inclusive Fintech Forum in Kigali, the 3i Africa Summit and SFF.</p><p>Additionally, GFTN will expand into new geographies to double its global footprint over the next five years, says Menon. The firm will integrate these various forums into a single network, building momentum through the year to culminate in the SFF.</p><p>In 2025, GFTN will launch its first thematic forum dedicated to fostering innovation and investment in climate technology and innovative sustainability solutions for the financial sector. Menon says that this is due to growing interest in financing climate technology solutions for carbon mitigation and climate resilience.</p><p>In addition, he points out that the GFTN forums will also place a growing emphasis on AI and quantum computing. The coupling of both could unlock huge opportunities and present unprecedented security challenges.</p><p>For its advisory business, GFTN will provide practitioner-led consultancy and capacity-building services in innovation and fintech-related issues. In addition to providing advisory services to developing country authorities to build digital infrastructures, formulate policies, and create innovation ecosystems, GFTN will also offer private entities market insights to support innovation programmes.</p><p>GFTN has already signed a memorandum of understanding with two central banks on fintech advisory services. The first is to support the efforts of the Bank of Namibia to build up its fintech ecosystem and digital public infrastructure, while the second is to support plans by the National Bank of Georgia to grow the country's fintech industry.</p><p>For its third business line platforms, GFTN offers platform services to enhance market access, provide analytics and information services, and support sustainability reporting. This will involve integrating three platforms that the MAS incubated into its network: Apix, Proxtera and Gprnt.</p><p>Apix, a cross-border open architecture platform, was co-founded by the MAS, the Asean Bankers Association and the International Finance Corporation in 2018. According to Menon, the Apix network now includes over 110 financial institutions and 2000 fintech firms from 90 countries.</p><p>Proxtera is a digital platform for small and medium enterprises to generate trusted digital credentials and access cross-border trade and financing. Launched by the MAS and the Infocomm Media Development Authority in 2018, it helps to bridge global trade for enterprises in Rwanda, Ghana, Chongqing and Cambodia.</p><p>The third platform, Gprnt, is a digital platform for verifiable environmental, social and governance (ESG) data and reporting launched by MAS in 2023. Gprnt is now focusing on piloting its tools with financial institutions, corporations, trade associations and government agencies. About 20 public and private sector organisations in Singapore have expressed and registered their interest, Menon adds.</p><p>GFTN's last strategic business is capital, where it aims to catalyse equity investments into early and growth-stage enterprises with the potential to succeed commercially and make a positive social impact.</p><p>\"We will provide these enterprises with patient capital to give them the time and space to build up the capabilities to succeed. We are already seeing promising investment ideas emanate from our existing GFTN ecosystem, which we aim to translate into high-quality deals with our fund investors. We will partner with world-class venture funds and asset managers to check on their investment expertise and investment infrastructure,\" says Menon. The fund has yet to apply for a licence with the MAS, and the central bank will not contribute to it.</p><p>Moving forward, Menon says GFTN will continue to work closely with its partners and the MAS to enhance the connectivity of the Singapore fintech ecosystem with regional and global markets. He adds: \"GFTN is here to serve a greater purpose - to harness the power of technology for a more efficient and resilient financial system, more inclusive financial services, expanded economic opportunities for broader segments of societies and a sustainable planet.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Singapore", "instances": ["The firm will integrate these various forums into a single network, building momentum through the year to culminate in the SFF.

There is also a need to minimise the \"black box syndrome\", where the massive amount of data, complexity of algorithms and dynamic nature of AI systems make results difficult to interpret and explain, he added. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Accountability is another factor, noted Mr Menon in his keynote address at the Singapore FinTech Festival. \"How can we hold humans ultimately responsible for decisions made by self-learning algorithms and machines? You cannot charge a machine for negligence in a court of law. You need to charge a person.\" </p><p> There is also a need to minimise unconscious bias, social exclusion and ethically unacceptable outcomes. </p><p> \"AI models trained on incomplete or biased data can generate seemingly plausible but unsound predictions. These can in turn lead to flawed financial decisions regarding credit or investments,\" said Mr Menon, chairman of the Global Finance and Technology Network (GFTN), a not-for-profit entity newly formed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). </p><p> GFTN's forums will have a growing emphasis on AI and quantum computing. Conferences are one of the network's four business lines, along with advisory and research services, digital platform services for firms, and an investment fund for technology start-ups.</p><p> If quantum technologies take off, the coupling of AI and quantum computing could unlock huge opportunities, as well as unprecedented security challenges, said Mr Menon. </p><p> GFTN forums will aim to address the pros and cons of various AI models and strengthen governance frameworks around AI, among other areas. </p><p> AI has been deployed in financial services through the likes of deep-learning models that analyse multiple layers of complex data to train sophisticated artificial neural networks. </p><p> For example, Ant International uses such models to assess a loan applicant's credit-worthiness by analysing thousands of data points from its online behaviour and digital footprint.</p><p> Large language models -- a specific tool within generative AI (gen AI) -- can process massive amounts of text data to predict human language patterns and create content. JP Morgan's large language model can, for instance, review 12,000 commercial credit agreements in seconds, a task which previously consumed 360,000 hours of work each year. </p><p> Gen AI can track transactions based on location, device and operating system, flagging any anomaly or behaviour that does not fit expected patterns, noted Mr Menon.

The PIF is the key regional forum in the Pacific that seeks to foster cooperation among its members and collaboration with external partners. This is the second time that Singapore is attending the PIF Leaders Meeting as a Dialogue Partner, following our admission in January 2022.  Minister Maliki delivered remarks during the PIF Leaders' session with Dialogue Partners on 28 August 2024. Minister Maliki highlighted that Singapore, as a fellow Small Island Developing State, understood the challenges faced by the Pacific, in particular climate change. He reaffirmed Singapore's support for the capacity-building efforts of the Pacific, through the customised \"Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing\" (SPARKS) technical assistance package launched at the last PIF Leaders Meeting in November 2023. The transcript of Minister Maliki's remarks is atAnnex.  During his visit, Minister Maliki met several leaders from the Pacific, including PIF Chair and Tonga Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni, PIF Secretary General Baron Waqa, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape, New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters, Federated States of Micronesia Secretary for Foreign Affairs Lorin S.

First, let me warmly congratulate Tonga for assuming chairmanship of the PIF. I would also like to congratulate the Cook Islands on its successful chairmanship and for steering the PIF over the past year.  Your Excellencies, I address you today not just as a Dialogue Partner of the PIF, but also as a fellow member of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) who appreciates the unique challenges that we face.It is precisely this understanding that drives Singapore's commitment to support the Pacific's implementation of the2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Allow me to share three points that underscore how Singapore is committed to supporting our Pacific partners.  First, addressing climate change and rising sea levels. As low-lying island states, we are at the frontline of facing rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and environment degradation. Climate change adaptation is a top priority for many of us. Singapore stands ready to share our experiences with our Pacific friends. For example, we are now planning to build a \"Long Island\" for coastal protection by reclaiming land at a higher level some distance away from our current coastline. Singapore wants to work together with the Pacific to address climate change by upholding and implementing the Paris Agreement, which we believe is our best hope to galvanise a collective solution to the complex, multi-dimensional problem of climate change. For the upcoming COP-29, we must continue to work together to keep the 1.5-degree Celsius goal within reach, including by reaching an ambitious outcome on a New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, which recognises the special circumstances of SIDS.  Second, building resilient economies and societies. The theme for this year's PIF Leaders' Meeting - \"Transformative Resilient Pasifiki: Build Better Now\"- is very timely. We fully support Tonga's priorities on building resilient health and education systems. Over the years, Singapore has conducted many capacity-building courses in health and education through the Singapore Cooperation Programme. The Programme has welcomed more than 6,100 Pacific officials over the past three decades. This year alone, we are organising seven courses on education and five courses on health. PIF members, as Small Island Developing States, will have priority access to these courses.  Your Excellencies, last year, we launched the Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing, or SPARKS, package - a specially customised three-year programme to support the Pacific's \"Regional Collective Actions\" as outlined in the2050 Strategyin three areas: climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law. I am pleased to update that we welcomed the first group of officials from the Pacific for the inaugural course on climate resilience in Singapore in May this year. The next course on international law, with a particular focus on climate and sea-level rise issues, will be held in November. We also launched the \"SIDS of Change\" technical assistance package at the Fourth International Conference on SIDS in May this year,which includes new customised programmes on emerging issues including blue carbon and digitalisation. We welcome our Pacific partners to participate actively in the SPARKS and SIDS of Change programmes.  Third, amplifying our collective voice. Many of the threats that we face, such as climate change and marine biodiversity loss, cannot be overcome by any single country alone. Singapore will continue working steadfastly with our Pacific partners at multilateral fora,including through the Alliance of Small Island States and the Forum of Small States,to advance our shared interests on the international stage. Singapore is honoured to work with our Pacific partners to achieve concrete progress. Last year, we successfully concluded the landmark agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, or better known as the BBNJ Agreement. The Agreement is crucial for SIDS like us, which depend on oceans and their biodiversity for our livelihoods. It is encouraging that most of the PIF members have signed on to the Agreement.Singapore is committed to the BBNJ Agreement and will be ratifying the Agreement very soon.  Your Excellencies, to conclude, Singapore has been a longstanding and steadfast supporter of the Pacific's development. During the third Singapore-Pacific High-Level Visit hosted by Singapore in May this year, I was encouraged by the Pacific leaders' strong commitment to turn vision into action. Singapore will continue to do our part to ensure that no one is left behind in our journey towards creating a better tomorrow for our people.  Malo 'aupito. Thank you very much.<br/><br/>. . . . .</p><p>Minister in Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Maliki Osman delivering remarks at the 53rdPacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting in Tonga, 28 August 2024.</p><p>Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Press Statements", "instances": ["This year alone, we are organising seven courses on education and five courses on health.

Heat resilience may be a new key factor", "published": "2024-09-03", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE heat resilience of a city is set to be an increasingly crucial factor for foreign investors -- in a sign of how climate adaptation is a growing economic priority for policymakers. </p><p> \"When multinational companies make decisions about the location of new investments, the host country's exposure to heatwaves and its energy reliability are going to be increasingly a key consideration factor,\" said economists from HSBC Global Research in an Aug 30 report. The authors highlighted three key economic impacts of heatwaves: lower agricultural output, diminished labour productivity, and greater occurrences of power outages, which can cause major disruptions to industries and hit a country's energy security.</p><p> These impacts have been especially pronounced over the past year due to the El Nino climate pattern -- which brings warmer conditions to the Pacific Ocean -- as well as the effects of climate change.The resulting heatwaves have had serious effects on Asian agriculture. In Japan, the 2023 heatwave caused quality issues with rice, leading to a shortage. In Vietnam, the heatwave earlier this year affected Robusta coffee production, causing bean prices to hit new highs.</p><p>  Food price inflation may have a spillover effect on core inflation by influencing expectations of consumers and businesses, the HSBC report noted. </p><p> Diminished labour productivity is another major economic impact of heatwaves. By 2030, more than 2 per cent of total working hours worldwide could be lost every year amid higher temperatures, according to a report by the International Labour Organization. In South Asia alone, under the scenario that global temperatures rise 1.5 deg C by the end of the century, heat stress would lead to a loss of 5.3 per cent of working hours in 2030, said the HSBC report. This corresponds to 43 million full-time jobs.</p><p> Energy security is yet another key issue, with countries facing grid overloads and power outages amid extreme heat. In Vietnam, major industrial parks in the north housing multinationals suffered power cuts in mid-2023. Given Asia's central role in global supply chains, disruptions to local manufacturing, shipping and logistics may drive up global tradable inflation, the HSBC report's authors noted.</p><p> \"In the context of intense competition among Asian economies to attract foreign direct investment from companies that look to diversify production bases, this makes host countries' energy policies and investment in energy infrastructure more important than ever,\" they said.</p><p> That said, there is a risk that governments respond to heatwaves in ways that worsen climate change, such as by ramping up coal usage or handing out more fossil fuel subsidies to boost energy supply. This is where it becomes crucial for policymakers to maintain a long-term perspective on climate resilience to minimise such knee-jerk reactions, while continuing to invest in the transition towards renewable energy. </p><p> For now, Asia is enjoying some respite from heat since the end of El Nino. However, the lessons from the past year's heatwaves should spur countries to enhance their heat resilience, especially as weather patterns become increasingly uncertain. </p><p> For foreign investors, a city's heat resilience could eventually become a non-negotiable.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["\"In the context of intense competition among Asian economies to attract foreign direct investment from companies that look to diversify production bases, this makes host countries' energy policies and investment in energy infrastructure more important than ever,\" they said.

It has prompted shifts in behaviour, and inspired concerted action. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Governments worldwide are enacting regulatory measures, such as carbon taxes, subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), and plans for green infrastructure development. Businesses are committing to net-zero emissions, setting science-based targets, and encouraging their supply chains to adopt more sustainable practices. Consumers increasingly favour sustainable products, and are altering their spending patterns accordingly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Meanwhile, some investors are advocating for action, heightening their focus on climate-related risks and setting minimum climate standards, which in turn influences portfolio allocations.</p><p> Although these transformations pose risks to asset prices, we recognise that they also herald a unique investment opportunity for our generation. </p><p> We advocate for a climate strategy that yields both environmental and financial returns, moving beyond traditional approaches. Generally, strategies focused solely on low emissions often rely on historical data without adequately accounting for shifts in business models or the tangible impacts on the environment. </p><p> Similarly, while green bond strategies contribute to funding eco-friendly projects, a strategy exclusively centred on green bonds may suffer from limited diversification, lower yield return and extended durations.</p><p> Such traditional methodologies do not sufficiently address the physical consequences of climate change, nor do they focus adequately on adaptation. Current policies place us on a trajectory towards a 2.4 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures, a scenario corroborated by our climate analysis. This warming path is likely to exacerbate weather volatility and temperature extremes, affecting both society at large and asset values.</p><p> Crafting a solutionAt the heart of a favourable solution is the conviction that climate outcomes should prioritise real-world emissions reduction, support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and facilitate adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change. Every investment decision should be made through a climate lens, necessitating a bespoke framework. This approach, coupled with a global opportunity set and a strategy focused on best ideas, is designed to yield compelling returns and income.</p><p> Climate transition in Asia will likely be core to the outcomes that are achieved on a global level considering the size of Asia's population, projected economic growth, exposure to higher emitting industries, and the opportunity to potentially leapfrog high-emitting technologies and adopt low-carbon solutions. Asian companies are often national, regional or even global leaders in their respective industries, which could translate to meaningful impact when they adopt more sustainable trajectories. </p><p> Covering the global universe, the strategy centres on identifying and investing in ambitious companies that are leading the charge in their respective industries. These trailblazers are making significant strides in real-world decarbonisation, disrupting traditional business models, pioneering innovative technologies, and responding proactively to evolving consumer demands. By aligning with such leaders, investors may capitalise on the growth of the climate market and achieve superior performance.</p><p> Three types of companies are worth a look -- those in high-emitting sectors that are setting the standard for emissions reduction; innovators who are developing the technologies and products essential for decarbonisation efforts; and entities that help societies adjust to the impacts of climate change and contribute to global climate resilience. </p><p> By carefully selecting companies that align with these themes, investors may seize a significant growth opportunity and contribute meaningfully to the efforts against climate change.</p><p> Fixed income instruments, including green and municipal bonds, are pivotal in channelling funds towards projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience. A comprehensive fixed income strategy should span various segments -- investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging market debt. </p><p> An additional nuance within the Asian bond universe is the presence of large state-owned enterprises that are focused on delivering policy objectives instead of solely profit, allowing bond investors the opportunity to lend to issuers that are involved in national infrastructure projects that are part of the government's strategy to move towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p> We currently see the opportunities in Asia in the renewable energy space, EVs and its corresponding value chain, as well as large corporates that are adopting more sustainable ways of manufacturing their products. </p><p> We expect the potential pipeline from Asia to continue to grow, and could span a wide variety of opportunities including low carbon materials production and climate adaptation.</p><p> Selecting the right theme is merely the beginning. Active company selection becomes crucial in ensuring that investments genuinely enhance the portfolio's value. </p><p> For credit investors, the application of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards across all issuers requires careful consideration, especially given the disparities between high-yield and investment-grade issuers. High-yield issuers -- often smaller or newer companies -- may not have the luxury of dedicated ESG teams, established green-bond frameworks, or the capacity to generate comprehensive sustainability reports. Consequently, companies genuinely committed to sustainability might be overlooked due to their inability to showcase their ESG credentials prominently.</p><p> A recent example is Ardagh Metal Packaging, a US-listed global producer of infinitely recyclable metal drinks cans. Until recently, this company lagged in ESG disclosures despite its strong alignment with sustainability, particularly within the circular economy and waste reduction sectors. In 2022, its recycling initiatives were estimated to have avoided 3.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions compared to using virgin materials.</p><p> This case highlights that ESG assessment should transcend mere box-ticking; there is no substitute for thorough research. Investors adept at identifying firms with commendable ESG practices, albeit with limited disclosure, stand to gain by investing ahead of the curve, before enhanced transparency garners wider market recognition. </p><p> A promising landscapeThe future of climate change investing looks bright, buoyed by the escalating global emphasis on environmental sustainability. Despite concerns, we maintain that the burgeoning demand for climate-related investments will not alone lead to overvaluation. The arena of climate transition presents a vast and perpetually evolving landscape of opportunities, far from being exhausted by current interest levels.</p><p> Most importantly, we believe a climate change investment strategy should have a dual objective -- achieving meaningful climate impact alongside robust financial returns. This approach transcends mere trend-following. It is about pinpointing and supporting innovative companies that lead the charge in industry transformation and real-world decarbonisation efforts. </p><p> This strategy opens the door to a wide spectrum of opportunities, enabling investors to engage with ventures that are not just promising in terms of returns but are also pivotal in the global transition to a more sustainable future.</p><p> It is imperative to curate a well-balanced portfolio encompassing leaders in emissions reduction, innovators in technology, and contributors to climate adaptation. This diversified strategy ensures resilience against potential overvaluation in any single region, sector or asset class by spreading exposure across the varied facets of climate transition.</p><p> The writer is investment director of fixed income, abrdn</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["These trailblazers are making significant strides in real-world decarbonisation, disrupting traditional business models, pioneering innovative technologies, and responding proactively to evolving consumer demands.

Investment and financing decisions must be financially viable, which can happen only if regulatory policy creates a conducive environment,\" she added. </p><p> Some basic building blocks include greater transparency through better governance and reporting, policy consistency and stability. This will give investors more confidence, especially in infrastructure projects that have a long-term horizon, as well as some degree of certainty around the future, financiers and observers told BT. </p><p> Cutting down bureaucratic hurdles of green projects could also scale them faster, and make them more attractive to private investment. </p><p> \"In Asia, one impediment to scaling up projects has been the propensity to haggle over contracts, which takes time. In Asean, for example, energy regulations vary across markets, often leading to power purchase agreement delays,\" said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer of OCBC. </p><p> Standardising contractual arrangements across the region could help green projects take off more quickly, he added. </p><p> Ensuring the commercial viability of new green climate technologies and solutions by creating market demand through policies and regulations is also another piece to the puzzle. That is because nascent green technologies are typically too costly to implement and lack demand, said Ng. </p><p> One example is Singapore's mandate for flights leaving Changi Airport to include sustainable aviation fuel in their fuel mix from 2026. </p><p> Aligning the Asean taxonomy on sustainable finance with other regional ones to develop commonalities on the definition of green economic activities could reduce concerns about greenwashing, said Tiza Mafira, director at Climate Policy Initiative. </p><p> Other forms of policy reforms could be potentially more challenging to implement, such as imposing a carbon tax regime for the region, as suggested by Ng. </p><p> \"The carbon tax will put a price on carbon and steer regional investments towards low-carbon alternatives in existing as well as new technologies,\" he added. </p><p> Of course, the biggest sacred cow in South-east Asia is fossil fuel subsidies. </p><p> With public funds already scarce, there is a need to optimise every dollar by shifting it away from fossil fuel subsidies, said Mafira. </p><p> The money should be redirected towards derisking and incentivising decarbonisation projects (such as the early closure of coal plants), as well as developing key enabling infrastructure (such as electricity grid optimisation). </p><p> However, that has yet to take place in many South-east Asian governments as it is a political hot potato. </p><p>Indonesia did not touch on its fossil fuel subsidy reform when it announced its grand plans to accelerate its climate ambitions during COP29 and a week later at the G20 summit at Brazil. </p><p> Nonetheless, observers said that Indonesia's move to bring forward its net-zero target by a decade to 2050 and close all of its fossil fuel plants by 2040 is a positive step. </p><p> While such initiatives can instill confidence in investors about the region's dedication to climate action, much will hinge on whether supportive policies are implemented and actionable strategies are put in place to facilitate their execution, said Cheok.</p><p> Yeo said that investors will still watch out for whether there is transparent and efficient implementations of such policies, given previous examples of bureaucratic delays and policy reversals in the past in the region.  </p><p> One week after Indonesia unveiled its new climate targets, it said that it will review plans to export clean electricity as the government prioritises national interests and sustainability in allocating natural energy resources. </p><p> Blended financeBesides policy support, greater innovation in financial instruments combined with blended finance mechanisms will move the needle most when attracting climate investments, said Clare Shakya, global managing director of climate of environmental non-profit The Nature Conservancy. </p><p> Blended finance is a capital-raising approach that leans on investors with higher risk appetites, such as development funds and philanthropists or governments, to provide concessional or catalytic capital to pull in more commercial investors. </p><p> A lower cost of capital, achieved through such structures, can improve the bankability of projects that would otherwise not be able to secure private capital. This is especially the case for emerging markets in South-east Asia, where a higher cost of capital has been a hurdle to the deployment of private capital, said Helge Muenkel, chief sustainability officer of DBS Bank.</p><p> To this end, Singapore said that it will commit US$500 million as concessional capital to support a blended-finance initiative, known as the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (Fast-P), at COP29. It also launched a third investment fund under Fast-P, which will focus on decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, with BlackRock as its fund manager.</p><p> Observers said that Singapore's initiative is commendable. But to fully mobilise private capital, it is also essential to have strong institutional frameworks and a pipeline of bankable projects, said Cheok. </p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Without sufficient funds, South-east Asian governments might face increasing financial strain as they will need to allocate more of their own budgets to climate-related expenditures.

Known as the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, this new sum of US$300 billion will supersede the previous target of at least US$100 billion a year, which expires in 2025.It is part of a wider effort to scale up climate financing to US$1.3 trillion every year until 2035, with the remaining US$1 trillion to be mobilised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from all public and private sources\u00e2\u20ac, though details on how this could be achieved remained unfinished. Policy supportRaising that remaining US$1 trillion is going to be a challenge, said Antony Warren, founder and chief executive officer of family office Eden Impact. While the rules governing the international trading of carbon credits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known as Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could help rebuild confidence in carbon markets and channel more private capital into climate-focused investments, policy support from Asean governments remains key to attracting private investors, he added. Even though private capital has a role to play in the energy transition, it cannot be expected to do it alone, said Melissa Moi, head of sustainable business at the corporate sustainability office at UOB.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Private participation depends on commerciality. Investment and financing decisions must be financially viable, which can happen only if regulatory policy creates a conducive environment,\u00e2\u20ac she added. Some basic building blocks include greater transparency through better governance and reporting, policy consistency and stability. This will give investors more confidence, especially in infrastructure projects that have a long-term horizon, as well as some degree of certainty around the future, financiers and observers told BT. Cutting down bureaucratic hurdles of green projects could also scale them faster, and make them more attractive to private investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Asia, one impediment to scaling up projects has been the propensity to haggle over contracts, which takes time. In Asean, for example, energy regulations vary across markets, often leading to power purchase agreement delays,\u00e2\u20ac said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer of OCBC. Standardising contractual arrangements across the region could help green projects take off more quickly, he added. Ensuring the commercial viability of new green climate technologies and solutions by creating market demand through policies and regulations is also another piece to the puzzle. That is because nascent green technologies are typically too costly to implement and lack demand, said Ng. One example is Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate for flights leaving Changi Airport to include sustainable aviation fuel in their fuel mix from 2026. Aligning the Asean taxonomy on sustainable finance with other regional ones to develop commonalities on the definition of green economic activities could reduce concerns about greenwashing, said Tiza Mafira, director at Climate Policy Initiative. Other forms of policy reforms could be potentially more challenging to implement, such as imposing a carbon tax regime for the region, as suggested by Ng. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The carbon tax will put a price on carbon and steer regional investments towards low-carbon alternatives in existing as well as new technologies,\u00e2\u20ac he added. Of course, the biggest sacred cow in South-east Asia is fossil fuel subsidies. With public funds already scarce, there is a need to optimise every dollar by shifting it away from fossil fuel subsidies, said Mafira. The money should be redirected towards derisking and incentivising decarbonisation projects (such as the early closure of coal plants), as well as developing key enabling infrastructure (such as electricity grid optimisation). However, that has yet to take place in many South-east Asian governments as it is a political hot potato. Indonesia did not touch on its fossil fuel subsidy reform when it announced its grand plans to accelerate its climate ambitions during COP29 and a week later at the G20 summit at Brazil. Nonetheless, observers said that Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to bring forward its net zero target by a decade to 2050 and close all of its fossil fuel plants by 2040 is a positive step. While such initiatives can instill confidence in investors about the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dedication to climate action, much will hinge on whether supportive policies are implemented and actionable strategies are put in place to facilitate their execution, said Cheok.Yeo said that investors will still watch out for whether there is transparent and efficient implementations of such policies, given previous examples of bureaucratic delays and policy reversals in the past in the region.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0One week after Indonesia unveiled its new climate targets, it said that it will review plans to export clean electricity as the government prioritises national interests and sustainability in allocating natural energy resources. Blended financeBesides policy support, greater innovation in financial instruments combined with blended finance mechanisms will move the needle most when attracting climate investments, said Clare Shakya, global managing director of climate of environmental non-profit The Nature Conservancy. Blended finance is a capital-raising approach that leans on investors with higher risk appetites, such as development funds and philanthropists or governments, to provide concessional or catalytic capital to pull in more commercial investors.\u00c2\u00a0A lower cost of capital, achieved through such structures, can improve the bankability of projects that would otherwise not be able to secure private capital. This is especially the case for emerging markets in South-east Asia, where a higher cost of capital has been a hurdle to the deployment of private capital, said Helge Muenkel, chief sustainability officer of DBS Bank.To this end, Singapore said that it will commit US$500 million as concessional capital to support a blended-finance initiative, known as the Financing Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Transition Partnership (Fast-P), at COP29. It also launched a third investment fund under Fast-P, which will focus on decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, with BlackRock as its fund manager.Observers said that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initiative is commendable. But to fully mobilise private capital, it is also essential to have strong institutional frameworks and a pipeline of bankable projects, said Cheok. In Asia, one impediment to scaling up projects has been the propensity to haggle over contracts, which takes time.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Without sufficient funds, South-east Asian governments might face increasing financial strain as they will need to allocate more of their own budgets to climate-related expenditures. This further burdens public finances and diverts funds from other priorities such as healthcare and education, said Melvyn Yeo, managing partner of venture capital firm Trirec. This includes rebuilding critical infrastructure such as coastal defences, early warning systems and resilient housing, as well as other sustainable development projects, observers told The Business Times. Unfortunately, emerging markets in this region are stuck between a rock and hard place."]}, {"relevance_score": 19, "title": "China Leads Way on Green Bond Issuance", "published": "2024-05-20", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Onshore and offshore green bonds originating from Chinese issuers in 2023 amounted to $131bn, according to Climate Bonds Initiative. </emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China remains the biggest green bond market for the second consecutive year, according to the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatebonds.net/resources/reports/china-state-market-report-2023\">Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI)</url>.</p><p>Green bonds for both onshore and offshore deals amounting to USD 131 billion originated from Chinese issuers in 2023.</p><p>Although this represented a 3.5% decrease in volume compared to 2022, the CBI noted that both the quality and credibility of green bonds increased, with 63.6% of these deals included in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatebonds.net/market/green-bond-database-methodology\">Green Bond Database (GBDB)</url>\u00a0- an increase from 57.3% the previous year.</p><p>\"We expect debt instruments to play a more prominent role in China's green transition and expect a credible transition finance market to provide additional funding for the decarbonisation of high carbon-emitting sectors, such as power, steel, chemicals and agriculture,\" said Sean Kidney, CBI's CEO.</p><p>\"Financing climate resilience will become the top priority on the agenda.\"</p><p>Germany came second in the ranking, having issued USD 67.5 billion in green bonds, while the UK moved up from seventh to fourth with USD 32.6 billion.</p><p>Hong Kong logged the single largest increase, having grown by 173.3% year-on-year.</p><p>For hard-to-abate sectors, China also maintained its status as the most frequent sustainability-linked bond (SLB) issuer, issuing 53 last year worth a total of USD 5.7 billion of debt.</p><p>\"There is still a lot of demand and investment opportunities for climate finance, and we look forward to seeing China continue to maintain its world leadership in sustainable finance in terms of policies, standards, product innovation, and capacity building,\" said Kidney.</p><p>\"This will not only help [the country] achieve its dual carbon goals, but also contribute to the global response to climate change and the goals of the Paris Agreement.\"</p><p>--</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more articles like this on Regulation Asia's sister publication,\u00a0ESG Investor.</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "Regulation Asia", "instances": ["3% the previous year.

The Ministry of Finance today published the eighth edition of the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR). SPOR, a biennial report, provides insights into how Singapore has fared in key areas of national interest, ranging from lifelong learning, health, housing and sustainability, economy, to security and diplomacy.</p><p>SPOR 2024 Key Themes</p><p>2. SPOR 2024 showcases the opportunities that Singaporeans have at every stage of life, how the Government is working towards quality and sustainable living, its efforts to safeguard Singapore's shared future and place in the world, as well as sustaining a strong and resilient economy. The report also highlights areas where Singaporeans have partnered one another and the Government, to own, shape and act on our shared future together.</p><p>3. Head of Civil Service, Mr Leo Yip, said, \"SPOR 2024 underscores the strides Singapore has made in key areas of national interest - with more opportunities for citizens, a quality living environment, a safe and secure Singapore, as well as a strong and resilient economy. It has also been heartening to see the Government, Singaporeans and businesses coming together as part of the Forward Singapore exercise to develop and implement initiatives that support and uplift the community. The Public Service remains committed to working with Singaporeans to address gaps and to build our shared future together.\"</p><p>Theme 1: Opportunities for All, at Every Stage of Life</p><p>4. Progress has been made to create opportunities for Singaporeans at every stage of their lives, from early education to retirement.</p><p>*Affordable and quality education: The number of full-day preschool places has increased to over 200,000 to meet demand. Preschool education has become more affordable. Our primary, secondary and post-secondary students have more pathways and opportunities to pursue their strengths and interests, and be better prepared for the future.</p><p>*Good jobs, lifelong learning, with strong social safety nets: In 2023, employment rate of residents aged 25 to 64 remained high at 82.6% and residents generally saw an increase in wages over the past few years. To help Singaporeans take charge of their career health and seize new job opportunities, jobseekers are supported through a nationwide network of Jobs and Skills Centres, and programmes for reskilling and upskilling. 98% of SkillsFuture trainees surveyed in 2023 reported better work performance, after training. Income inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, declined to 0.371 in 2023 after accounting for taxes and transfers, reflecting the redistributive effect of government support measures and taxes and efforts to uplift wages of lower-wage workers. The Government also provided more support to lower-income households through short-term cost-of-living support, and schemes such as Workfare which are permanent components of our social safety nets. We have recognised Singaporeans' concerns on cost-of-living in a time of global inflation, and continue to help Singaporeans with daily expenses through the Assurance Package.</p><p>*A Singapore Made For Families: Similar to many other societies, Singapore saw a decline in the resident total fertility rate, which reached 0.97 in 2023 due to fewer and later marriages as well as births. We implemented more measures to support Singaporeans across their marriage and parenthood journey. These included enhancements to the Baby Bonus Scheme and leave measures, and raising full-day infant care places by around 50% in the last five years.</p><p>*Healthy and active living: Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies globally. We reduced the prevalence of high cholesterol and diabetes in Singapore and implemented measures to support healthier and active lifestyles. However, the prevalence of high blood pressure and obesity rose. Self-reported poor mental health decreased from 2022 to 2023, and the Government stepped up efforts to support mental health by launching the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy in 2023. Healthcare remains affordable through subsidies, MediShield Life, and MediSave. Median wait times for adults in public hospitals rose due to factors such as COVID-19-related delays in healthcare infrastructure projects and increasing healthcare needs of our ageing population. We continued to invest in our healthcare infrastructure to ensure sufficient capacity and build a future-ready healthcare system.</p><p>*Retirement and ageing well: Measures such as the raised retirement and re-employment ages have given more opportunities for seniors who wish to continue working, in turn raising the employment rate of seniors. Schemes such as the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme and Majulah Package have helped provide greater assurance of meeting basic retirement needs. We are also supporting seniors to age well and independently through Age Well SG.</p><p>Theme 2: Quality and Sustainable Living</p><p>5. Singapore maintained a quality living environment that is well connected, and we are committed to building an endearing home for current and future generations.</p><p>*We provided affordable and accessible public housing with shortened wait times. Housing estates were rejuvenated through initiatives like the Home Improvement Programme and Neighbourhood Renewal Programme. Public transport connectivity was expanded, shortening travel time, and 92% of residents could walk, cycle or ride to their neighbourhood centres within 20 minutes. More opportunities were created for Singaporeans to enjoy and appreciate our arts and heritage, green spaces, and nature.</p><p>*For a clean, green, and resilient Singapore, we have ensured water resilience and strengthened resilience in energy and food. We have also taken steps to address climate resilience and protect our natural environment.</p><p>Theme 3: Our Shared Future and Place in the World</p><p>6. Singapore has safeguarded our peace and stability, and contributed to regional and international security and humanitarian efforts. We worked with Singaporeans to foster a strong national identity and cohesive community.</p><p>*Singapore contributed to various international security and humanitarian assistance efforts with swift responses to contingencies and maintained high operational readiness to meet our security needs. Singaporeans maintained high confidence in the Home Team's and Singapore Armed Forces' ability to keep Singapore safe and secure.</p><p>*We deepened relations with partners and contributed to the global commons like international maritime law and cybersecurity.</p><p>*Singapore remained one of the safest countries in the world, with low physical crime and recidivism rates. While scams remained a key concern, the Government continued to work closely with the private sector such as banks and our community to fight against scams.</p><p>*We also continued to invest in fostering a strong national identity and a cohesive community by co-creating meaningful initiatives with citizens, community groups and businesses. Over 35 Alliances for Action with citizens, community groups, and businesses were formed to co-create and prototype ideas in areas of opportunity or to address common challenges. The Singapore Government Partnerships Office was also launched to strengthen partnerships and engagements with citizens.</p><p>Theme 4: Strong and Resilient Economy</p><p>7. Our economic fundamentals remained robust and continued to be strengthened, despite structural shifts and a challenging external environment.</p><p>*Between 2019 and 2023, Singapore's real Gross Domestic Product grew at an annualised rate of 2.6%. Singapore remained attractive to businesses and pressed on with our industry transformation efforts. Progress was made towards Manufacturing, Services and Trade 2030 goals. We continued to support enterprise growth and transformation and develop a supportive innovation ecosystem. To maintain Singapore's appeal to businesses, we invested further in SkillsFuture to raise our local workforce competitiveness and empower Singaporeans to take charge of their career health.</p><p>* We further strengthened physical and digital connectivity by investing in our maritime and aviation hubs, and building our digital infrastructure. For future growth, we are building capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainability. Emerging technologies, such as generative AI, present opportunities to improve productivity and strengthen our industries' competitiveness, but they also bring challenges. We intensified our efforts to defend against cyberthreats and build a safer digital domain.</p><p>Special Chapter: Spirit of Forward Singapore</p><p>8. The Forward Singapore exercise brought Singaporeans together to chart a roadmap for Singapore's next stage of development. Forward Singapore is about renewing our social compact to keep our society strong, and sharing the benefits of progress with all Singaporeans. In an increasingly interconnected and rapidly changing world filled with both opportunities and risk, every sector of our society - individuals, communities and businesses - plays a role towards shaping Singapore's future. Through fostering collaboration and partnerships, we can harness our diverse strengths and resources to navigate uncertainty, and more effectively bring Singapore forward.</p><p>SPOR 2024 can be accessed via go.gov.sg/SPOR or the QR code below.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Finance,Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Health Care, ESG]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["More opportunities were created for Singaporeans to enjoy and appreciate our arts and heritage, green spaces, and nature. *For a clean, green, and resilient Singapore, we have ensured water resilience and strengthened resilience in energy and food.

Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Indonesia International Sustainability Forum 2024. I would like to congratulate Kemenko Marves and Kadin Indonesia for hosting this significant event.</p><p>The world is currently on a pathway to 2.1 to 2.8 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2100. This is too much. Increasingly, through floods and heat waves, all of us are seeing how climate change can profoundly disrupt lives and livelihoods.</p><p>Combating climate change will require the collective and consistent action of all stakeholders.</p><p>Asia must be at the forefront of change. We have more than half of the world's population, and are one of the key engines of global economic growth.</p><p>Today's ISF gathers many stakeholders who are committed to advancing ASEAN's net-zero ambitions. There is much that we can do and do together. Let me suggest three key practical sustainability pathways towards a net-zero ASEAN.</p><p>Building up Energy Infrastructure and the ASEAN Power Grid</p><p>The first sustainability pathway is building up green energy infrastructure. ASEAN is blessed with significant renewable energy potential. Indonesia itself has abundant solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy resources.</p><p>We can work together to realise this potential through our vision of an ASEAN Power Grid. Regional grids can better match supply with demand - countries that can produce more renewable energy than they need can export the excess. An ASEAN Grid will also allow seasonal variations in green energy output to be balanced out across the region. The revenue created will improve the bankability of renewable energy projects, which will in turn accelerate the deployment of more of such projects and support the phasing out of fossil fuels. It is a virtuous cycle.</p><p>Within ASEAN today, we have several bilateral interconnections over land. But much of ASEAN is archipelagic, especially Indonesia. We need stronger transmission systems to underpin our regional energy transition, and to build climate resilience. If we want a truly interconnected regional grid in ASEAN, we must work together to develop subsea cables. This will allow electricity to be traded along multiple routes and in multiple directions.</p><p>Indonesia and Singapore are collaborating to advance the development of a regional power grid. At the inaugural ISF last year, Indonesia and Singapore jointly announced Conditional Approvals for five projects to import 2GW of low-carbon electricity from Indonesia to Singapore. This year, we will advance these projects to the next step of development by issuing them Conditional Licences.</p><p>We will also be issuing new Conditional Approvals to two more projects to import an additional 1.4GW of low-carbon electricity from Indonesia to support our future energy needs. Singapore's Second Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng will elaborate on this later.</p><p>When these projects are realised, they will catalyse Indonesia's green economy by supporting investments for manufacturing solar photovoltaics and battery energy storage systems. These projects will also be one of the first building blocks for an expanded ASEAN Power Grid.</p><p>Let's work together to strengthen both domestic grids, and cross-border energy infrastructure overland and under the sea. This will create new pathways and new possibilities, and a stronger, more climate resilient and integrated ASEAN. All of us know there is no transition without transmission!</p><p>Scaling Up New Technologies</p><p>The second sustainability pathway is the scaling up of new green technologies, by mainstreaming them, and lowering the costs.</p><p>Carbon Capture and Storage, or CCS, has an important role to play in allowing us to achieve our net-zero targets. There is growing international recognition that CCS technology can safely and permanently store carbon within the ground to decarbonise our emissions.</p><p>We will need to devote resources to develop this technology, bring the costs of implementation down, and make it a viable part of ASEAN's decarbonisation path. Governments will also need to establish legal frameworks to encourage the use of CCS.</p><p>Indonesia and Singapore are also collaborating closely on CCS. In January 2024, Indonesia became the first Southeast Asian country to develop cross-border CCS-related legislation. One month later in February 2024, Singapore signed a Letter of Intent with Indonesia to collaborate on CCS.</p><p>We hope to continue working with Indonesia and other partners in the region to catalyse the deployment of cross-border CCS projects in ASEAN.</p><p>Financing</p><p>The third sustainability pathway is financing for decarbonisation projects.</p><p>Large-scale investments in renewables cannot be financed solely by the public sector nor solely by the private sector. Blended financing initiatives can help derisk projects, improve project bankability, and draw in more commercial capital.</p><p>One way that Singapore is supporting blended financing is through Singapore's Financing Asia's Transition Partnership, or FAST-P. FAST-P aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion from public and private sector partners to de-risk and finance currently marginally bankable green and transition projects in Asia. This will complement the existing suite of initiatives aimed at financing climate-related projects in the region.</p><p>Closing</p><p>The size of the climate challenge is daunting, and time is not on our side. But there are clear pathways to success. There are many opportunities for Indonesia and Singapore to work together, and with other ASEAN member states, to create a sustainable ASEAN for the future together. Through today's ISF, I hope we will be able to turn more of these opportunities into reality. I thank all of you for your attention and I wish you all the best in our sustainability journey.</p><p>[Category: Consumer Durables &amp; Apparel, Events]</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Within ASEAN today, we have several bilateral interconnections over land.

Good morning to all, and for many of our guests from around the world, welcome to Singapore. It is my pleasure to join you today at the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit.</p><p>2. This week is significant for the global discourse on sustainability and innovation. As the 29th Conference of the Parties takes place in Azerbaijan to discuss climate action, we are gathered here with the shared goal of transforming the agri-food sector and securing a sustainable future for food production.</p><p>Innovation's role in food security</p><p>3. The agri-food system is facing unprecedented challenges due to factors such as climate change, disease outbreaks and geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world. Climate change is already disrupting food supply through erratic weather patterns. Prolonged droughts, heavy rainfall and floods are becoming more frequent, putting strain on crop yields. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global crop yields could fall by as much as 30 per cent by 2050 from 2022. Rising temperatures are also accelerating the spread of diseases among livestock, further threatening our food supply. Geopolitical tensions have disrupted agricultural infrastructure and policies by some governments to restrict food trades have also disrupted food supply chains, leading to higher food prices worldwide. Similarly, disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 pandemic underscored and intensified food security challenges, revealing vulnerabilities across logistical and distribution networks.</p><p>4. For a small nation like Singapore that imports more than 90 per cent of our food we consume here, we are particularly vulnerable to global food supply disruptions. This highlights the need for a local production buffer against global food supply disruptions, a form of insurance to grow some of our own food locally.</p><p>5. Innovation will continue to play a key role in helping us overcome various constraints and build our local production capabilities. In the agriculture and aquaculture sector, new technologies like precision farming, vertical agriculture, and closed-containment aquaculture systems are just a few examples of how innovation is transforming the way we grow food here. These technologies allow us to grow more with greater efficiency and climate resilience that we used to. At the same time, as we adopt new technologies and develop alternative proteins, innovation is crucial to ensuring that the food we produce is safe to eat.</p><p>6. Through the strong partnerships forged between Governments, businesses, researchers and industry, we can ensure that novel foods are developed in a well-regulated and science-based ecosystem, so consumers can feel confident with these new novel products.</p><p>7. In my speech today, I would like to share about how my Ministry, together with the Singapore Food Agency and a diverse group of stakeholders across the entire food value chain have also taken an ecosystem approach to co-develop the Singapore Aquaculture Plan.</p><p>Building a Resilient, Sustainable Aquaculture Sector</p><p>8. At last year's Singapore International Agri-Food Week, I shared on plans to co-develop the Singapore Aquaculture Plan and uplift the local aquaculture sector. Various parties, Industry, nature groups, academia and research institutions, as well as various Government agencies, were interested in solutions to achieve sustainable and productive aquaculture in Singapore.</p><p>9. Hence we got together - This is the first time we have brought stakeholders from across the entire system to collectively create a roadmap and vision for our aquaculture sector in Singapore. After several months of discussions and co-creation, I am pleased to announce today the launch of our Singapore Aquaculture Plan (SAP) paper. The paper is a collaborative effort that embodies our collective vision for the sector and serves as a roadmap for future aquaculture development in Singapore.</p><p>10. Through the discussions, we sought innovative approaches to balance sustainability with productivity and to uplift the aquaculture sector. The plan has five pillars.</p><p>Pillar 1: Space &amp; Infrastructure Planning</p><p>11. The first pillar is Space and Infrastructure Planning. Space and infrastructure are critical to supporting the growth of Singapore's aquaculture sector. SFA regularly launches land and sea space tenders with long-term leases to provide the stability farms need to invest and grow. Environmental studies for key aquaculture sites ensure we balance growth with environmental responsibility.</p><p>12. We will explore the implementation of site selection studies to assess feasibility of potential aquaculture sites early in the planning process, leverage renewable energy solutions like floating photovoltaic systems and study shared infrastructure solutions like processing and storage facilities to support the sector's growth.</p><p>Pillar 2: Enabling Regulations</p><p>13. The second pillar is Enabling Regulations. A strong regulatory framework is vital to shaping the industry's growth and ensuring its long-term sustainability. Our regulatory framework is designed to ensure that aquaculture development aligns with national standards for safety, space optimisation and environmental sustainability. Thus, to keep up with global developments in sustainability, SFA will manage farms via a nutrient budget approach. The carrying capacity model establishes the maximum allowable production from a farming area to meet environmental quality targets, protecting sensitive habitats like coral reefs and maintaining water quality. This science-based approach sets limits on nutrient (i.e. Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Carbon) discharge rather than limits on production level, and encourages farms to adopt sustainable practices and technologies to minimize nutrient output, allowing more production within a site while protecting the environment. This is in addition to our plans to strengthen farm management and animal husbandry practices under the planned Food Safety and Security Bill.</p><p>14. We will continue to support farms to meet production requirements. We recently operationalised the Aquaculture Sensing Network (ASN) to support the aquaculture industry in water quality monitoring, and to better monitor the nutrient discharges from farms, The ASN comprises of a network of water quality sensors at aquaculture zones and complemented by water and sediment sampling. This data provides operational insights on various water quality parameters, providing early warning against environmental threats such as harmful algal blooms. The ASN is an example of how sustainable growth can be achieved through technology and collaboration, to better manage our aquaculture industry in relation to global trends.</p><p>Pillar 3: Research, Innovation, Enterprise</p><p>15. The third pillar is Research, Innovation and Enterprise. Innovation is key to unlocking the potential of our aquaculture industry. Through our partnership with Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, the Marine Aquaculture Centre (MAC) has achieved significant breakthroughs. An example is the improvement of growth rates for Asian Seabass through a long-term selective breeding program, resulting in a significant increase in average body weight of the fish from the initial generation to the latest selectively bred line.</p><p>16. Additionally, MAC has developed large-scale indoor aquaculture system for Asian Seabass fry production and has pioneered husbandry techniques to combat disease, such as low salinity culture methods to address Big Belly Disease in seabass hatchery production.</p><p>17. To further innovation in agri-food, over $300 million has been made available under the Singapore Food Story (SFS) R&amp;D Programme to enable R&amp;D in the aquaculture, urban agriculture, future foods and food safety domains. Within the aquaculture domain, research efforts are focused on areas such as the development of superior fry and fingerlings, improving feed conversion ratio and cost effectiveness, and reducing fish mortality from key diseases. Under the SFS R&amp;D Programme, we also established the AquaPolis Programme to strengthen the collaboration between local and international aquaculture researchers and industry players. AquaPolis stakeholders have been actively engaged to identify key problem statements and develop research proposals relevant to the industry. Together, we will embark on scalable translational R&amp;D projects to advance industry technological capabilities, promote knowledge sharing and technology transfer, and strengthen the local ecosystem to raise the productivity and profitability of local farms. MAC will continue to play a key role in supporting AquaPolis research efforts. Researchers can already tap on MAC's expertise in breeding and hatchery production as well as resources and test-bedding facilities to develop innovative solutions.</p><p>Pillar 4: Ecosystem Development</p><p>18. The fourth pillar is Ecosystem Development. Building a robust ecosystem is essential to driving the growth and competitiveness of Singapore's aquaculture industry. Several initiatives are already in place to strengthen the sector. The Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund provides co-funding to help farms to adopt sustainable farming technologies to boost productivity and lower costs. The Aquatic Animal Health Services was introduced to provide veterinary support to farms to enhance their farm biosecurity and disease management.We have also been developing a local talent pipeline through partnerships with Institutes of Higher Learnings to equip our workforce with the skills needed to support agri-food industry innovation.</p><p>19. Dedicated funding under the ACT Fund will support the development of Closed Containment Aquaculture Systems. Central to our efforts is the launch of the National Broodstock Centre and the Hatchery Development and Recognition Programme.</p><p>20. A key focus within this pillar is the upgrading of local hatchery capabilities. They play a vital role in translating genetically superior eggs into high quality fingerlings to meet industry needs. This will reduce reliance on overseas sources, lower mortality rates, and enhance the sector's resilience.</p><p>21. These initiatives will collectively enhance Singapore's aquaculture ecosystem and unlock export opportunities, positioning Singapore as a leading tropical aquaculture hub.</p><p>Pillar 5: Demand Offtake and Promotion of Local Produce</p><p>22. The fifth and final pillar is strengthening demand offtake and promotion of local produce. We are taking a holistic approach to increase demand across individual, industry, and national levels. Since 2019, we have launched marketing campaigns and educational initiatives to raise awareness of the benefits of local seafood. We have also collaborated with supermarkets, sponsored events, and engaged the community through culinary programs. At the industry level, we've partnered with the Hotel, Restaurant and Catering (HoReCa) sector and introduced the Farm-To-Table Recognition Programme to recognise businesses that procure local produce. Nationally, we piloted the Food Resilience Preparedness Programme in schools to educate young Singaporeans on food security and the importance of supporting local produce.</p><p>23. SFA has been working closely with international partners to enhance market access for our locally farmed fish, providing the impetus for our farms to scale up their production. Just earlier this month, we signed protocols with China, allowing six species of our locally farmed fish to be sold into the Chinese market. This agreement represents a significant opportunity for our local farms to reach China's vast population and further elevate Singapore's brand of high-quality, fresh produce.</p><p>24. Moving forward, we will continue to expand marketing and consumer education efforts, highlighting the nutritional benefits of local aquaculture products, and continuing to strengthen supply chains for broader access. Through these initiatives, we aim to build consumer trust and support the sustainable growth of our aquaculture industry.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>25. The Singapore Aquaculture Plan paper represents the collective vison and resolve of all stakeholders in transforming our agri-food industry. This plan not only strengthens our local food production but also paves the way for Singapore to establish itself as a leader in sustainable aquaculture practices.</p><p>26. The success of our efforts will depend on strong collaboration across the public and private sectors, as well as meaningful engagement with the wider community. The innovations discussed at this summit in both agriculture and aquaculture will play a crucial role in shaping the future of food security, not just in Singapore but across the world.</p><p>27. Let's continue to work together to create a sustainable, resilient agri-food system that can weather the challenges of tomorrow. Thank you, and I wish you all a fruitful summit ahead.</p><p>[Category: Paper/Forest Products, Fertilizers &amp; Agricultural Chemicals, Chemicals, Specialty Retail, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Innovation will continue to play a key role in helping us overcome various constraints and build our local production capabilities.

Good morning. I am pleased to join you for the annual RICS x REDAS conference, and I congratulate RICS and REDAS for successfully organising yet another year of this conference. This is a meaningful platform that brings together professionals and practitioners from the building and real estate sector to exchange views and gain insights into the opportunities and challenges the sector faces in our move towards a net zero future.</p><p>2. Today, we gather under the banner of \"Net Zero Carbon Cities: Dream or Reality\", a theme that challenges us to reimagine cities of our future. The pursuit of net zero cities is not a mere aspiration, but an essential reality that we must actively shape with sound decisions.</p><p>3. Cities are responsible for over 70% of global CO2 emissions today. More specifically, the Built Environment sector accounts for approximately 40% of global CO2 emissions. One of the factors causing cities to have higher emissions is the Urban Heat Island, or UHI effect. This is where urban areas are warmer than the surrounding areas due to increased human activities, reduced green spaces, and more built-up areas. The United Nations projects that approximately 2.5 billion more people will be living in cities by 2050. Urbanisation, along with its associated infrastructure and energy needs, will exacerbate the UHI effect as cities replace natural landscapes with concrete, trapping heat. As the temperatures in cities rise, the energy demands for cooling also increases, leading to even higher emissions and creating a vicious cycle for cities and indeed, globally.</p><p>4. It is important to strike a balance between preserving nature and urban development. As we grapple with emissions from growing cities, the building and real estate sector can help with creative solutions to green our buildings and to reduce rising emissions driven by urbanisation. How we design our buildings and the materials we choose can either aggravate or mitigate the impacts of heat on our built environment. For example, we can reduce the heat on buildings using cool paint coatings. In Singapore, HDB has started to pilot cool paint technology in Tampines. The cool paint has shown to potentially reduce on-site temperature by up to 2 degrees Celsius. If the pilot initiative, expected to be completed by the end of this year, is found to be successful, the application of cool paint can be extended to more estates.</p><p>Building a Net Zero Singapore</p><p>5. The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach to urban development and prioritises the greening of our built environment. Using innovation and technology, we seek to build a liveable green city in every aspect of our daily lives, be it designing climate resilient buildings, greening our energy sources, or promoting sustainable commuting options. Allow me to share some of our national-level strategies to promote this.</p><p>6. As a city-state, buildings account for over 20% of Singapore's emissions. Greening our buildings is therefore a key strategy to achieve our sustainability ambitions under our Singapore Green Plan 2030, and to fulfil our international commitments on climate change. Under our Singapore Green Plan, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC) have jointly developed the Singapore Green Building Masterplan (SGBMP), which captures our collective commitment to pursue more ambitious sustainability standards in our built environment. The masterplan aims to deliver three targets of \"80-80-80 in 2030\". The first 80 is to green 80% of our buildings by 2030. The second 80 strives to have 80% of our new developments be Super Low Energy buildings from 2030. The third is to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency for best-in-class green buildings by 2030. As of the end of 2022, about 55% of Singapore's buildings by gross floor area (GFA) have been greened, nearly 20% of new developments by GFA are Super Low Energy buildings, while the best-in-class buildings have achieved a 71% improvement in energy efficiency compared to 2005 levels .</p><p>7. We are also aiming to make Singapore a net zero city by harnessing greener energy such as solar power and emerging low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen. Given our limitations as a small nation and being disadvantaged in alternative energy, we are prioritising innovation and collaboration to reshape our energy supply. One example is the Keppel Infrastructure @ Changi, where solar panels have been seamlessly incorporated into the facility's design, maximising energy while minimising environmental impact. Together with solar panels on its rooftop, the building can generate approximately 600,000 kWh of renewable energy per year, enough to offset more than twice of the building's energy consumption.</p><p>8. Beyond that, we are also transforming Singapore into a City in Nature. By 2030, every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park. Our urbans areas will be naturalised and greened even further. Our Jurong Lake District (JLD) for example, is planned as the largest mixed-used business district outside the city centre and will serve as a living lab for urban sustainability solutions. Notably, the 90-hectre Jurong Lake Gardens within JLD will help to promote climate resilience through water sensitive-urban designs which will cleanse water runoff and harvest rainwater to irrigate plants. JLD serves as an example of advanced urban design that combines extensive green spaces, smart technology, and sustainable infrastructure, setting a new standard for urban development. Such projects allow us to demonstrate, test and refine new technologies and solutions, which enable us to find an optimal solution to achieve our net zero goals.</p><p>Support for the Built Environment Sector</p><p>9. I am heartened that many of you are driving sustainability in your sector through the many iconic buildings and infrastructure that the building and real estate sector has worked hard to build. We have also made progress in developing net zero buildings. One example is the National University of Singapore's School of Design and Environment which won the Green Mark Platinum Champion Award by BCA. The building incorporates innovative features like solar panels and a hybrid cooling system which balances out the energy it generates and consumes. Another is DBS Newton Green, which was certified by BCA as a Green Mark Platinum Zero Energy development and is Singapore's first net zero building by a bank. Samwoh Smart Hub industrial building, too, has been recognised with BCA's Platinum (Positive Energy) award for generating more energy than it uses and has close to 2,600 solar panel to generate enough energy to achieve net energy surplus.</p><p>10. But we understand that incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into business practices often entails significant investments, not just in terms of capital, but also in innovation.</p><p>11. To support the industry, BCA has several schemes. The Green Mark Incentive Scheme, for example, has been instrumental in promoting the adoption of environmentally friendly building technologies and designs practices through cash and gross floor area incentives. Recently, we announced key amendments to the Building Control Act to enact the Mandatory Energy Improvement (MEI) regime. The MEI regime requires owners of energy intensive buildings to engage a professional to carry out the energy audit of the building's energy consuming system. This in turn pushes industry players to implement measures to reduce energy consumption.</p><p>12. While the Government has a significant role to play in supporting our journey towards net zero, the impact will be much bigger if every company and every individual in the built sector champions environmental sustainability across various domains in their organisations.</p><p>13. Over the years, we have seen technology in the built environment, ranging from climate control materials, energy, water and waste management to air quality control quickly developing. Though the science of climate change is still evolving, we must continue to boldly experiment with cutting-edge technologies available to pave the way for innovative solutions that can transform the built environment of Singapore into a greener and more sustainable one.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>14. In conclusion, the building and real estate sector is vital to Singapore's continued commitment to achieving net zero. I encourage all companies to take bold steps in integrating innovation, collaboration and eco-friendly practices into your next projects.</p><p>15. With the proactive engagement and commitment of all players in the industry, together, we can build a future where Singapore remains a world-class city, and where real estate developers and stakeholders collectively build legacies that stand the test of time and contribute towards a resilient, vibrant and sustainable home for all Singaporeans.</p><p>16.

Let me first say that Singapore is very gratified to be the latest Dialogue Partner of the Pacific Islands Forum. Thank you all for your warm welcome. Thank you for your guidance and hospitality, and the chance for me to visit this part of the world for the first time. I recall the words of Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka of Fiji - he talked about the Pacific being once referred to as \"the corner of the world\", but now actually being the centre of the future.</p><p>2 Singapore, like many of you, was colonised because we missed the Industrial Revolution. That is why we all speak English today. Secondly, like many of you, we were also the theatre of war during the Second World War and (while) we were not privy to those political conflicts, we were victims nevertheless. Our third similarity is that, for most of us, we would claim our independence in the last five or six decades. Our key goal from thereon has been development - to give our people the skills to master the technologies of the future, jobs, and especially for young people, prospects for the future. A fourth area of similarity is that as small island states, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, climate change is a clear and present threat. The rising sea levels, the high frequency and intensity of storms and droughts, are clear, present and future threats to all our well-being.</p><p>3 In the case of Singapore, we view our relations with the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) as strategic, and it will make a difference for our collective future. Although we are the latest Dialogue Partner, we have longstanding relationships with many of you. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the leaders and Foreign Ministers in this room over the past decade or so.</p><p>4 Singapore, as a Dialogue Partner, wants to work with you on human capacity development. We established the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in 1992 as a way to pay forward the assistance which Singapore had received decades earlier from the international community and from the multilateral organisations, many of which are represented here today. Over the past 30 years, we have welcomed more than 5,800 Pacific Island officials to Singapore under the Singapore Cooperation Programme.</p><p>5 With our accession as a Dialogue Partner, I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing (SPARKS) package, which will be a specially customised three-year programme for the Pacific to support your priorities in the2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. This programme will run from 2024 to 2026 and focus on three areas: first, climate resilience, second, cybersecurity, and third, international law.</p><p>6 On the first point, we will run a modular programme on urban governance, on planning and development to enhance climate resilience. Second, we will make available placements in Singapore's Cybersecurity Agency's Cyber Leadership Programme to equip officials with the knowledge on cyber and digital security to support national policymaking and participation in international discussions. I think if any of us think we have not yet been penetrated, it just means we have not discovered it yet. It is a clear and present threat, and we need to approach this both at the operational level - (with) the engineers, and also at the policy level. We hope to share and exchange ideas with leaders and officials from the Pacific Islands. The third area in which we want to work with you is in international law, and with a particular focus on climate and sea-level rise issues.

Singapore supports the PIF Leaders' Vision for 2050 to develop a new generation of leaders who are able to tackle the unique needs of the Pacific to build a resilient Pacific Region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion and prosperity.</p><p>To that end,Minister Balakrishnan announced that Singapore will launch a special Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing (SPARKS) package. The SPARKS package will be provided under the auspices of the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), through which Singapore has served as a partner to the Pacific on its development journey for the past 30 years. The SPARKS package, which will run from 2024 to 2026, will focus on supporting the capacity building efforts of the Pacific in the priority areas of climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law to address challenges identified in the2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. For a start, the SPARKS package will comprise the following programmes:</p><p>(a) Climate Resilience. Singapore will offer a customised 3-year modular programme for city leaders and senior officials from PIF members to enhance capacity building in urban governance, planning, and development to achieve climate resilience. The programme, which comprises one module each year over three years, would cover policy frameworks as well as implementation strategies to help cities formulate their development plans, including through preliminary draft planning of their city action plans with the assistance of domain experts. Participants will also learn more about the longer-term strategies for climate resilience and climate change adaptation.</p><p>(b) Cybersecurity.Singapore will offer placement to senior officials from PIF members in Singapore Cyber Security Agency (CSA)'s newly launched SG Cyber Leadership Programme to be delivered through the ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence in Singapore from 2024 to 2026. The programme will comprise Foundational-level and Advanced-level modules which seek to equip officials responsible for national cyber and digital security-related policies with the broad-based training on the operational, technical, legal and diplomatic aspects of cyber and digital security, with the view of providing tools to support national policymaking and participation in regional and international discussions. As part of the programme, participants will have the opportunity to engage with key representatives from industry and various international organisations, as well as other senior officials from regions across the world. Participants in the SG Cyber Leadership Programme can also look forward to future Alumni programmes and resources that will be set up following the first run of the programme in 2024.</p><p>(c) International Law.Singapore will offer up to three runs of an online course on international law, covering topics of direct relevance to the Pacific, such as Climate Change and Ocean issues, the work of the UNInternational Law Commission on Sea-Level Rise, the preservation of maritime zones, and climate change litigation before domestic and regional courts and human rights treaty bodies. The course aims to provide participants with an understanding of how international law can help address challenges posed by climate change, particularly rising sea levels.</p><p>For more details on the SPARKS package, please contact the Technical Cooperation Directorate at the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs via Ms Charmaine Yeow, Technical Cooperation Officer <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atcharmaine_yeow@mfa.gov.sg\">atcharmaine_yeow@mfa.gov.sg</email>  For enquiries on the cybersecurity programme, please contact CSA's International Cyber Policy Office via Mr Vikneswaran Selvam, Manager <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atvikneswaran_selvam@csa.gov.sg\">atvikneswaran_selvam@csa.gov.sg</email> , Ms Clara Ho, Manager <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atclara_ho@csa.gov.sg\">atclara_ho@csa.gov.sg</email> , and Mr Nasri Sadi, Assistant Manager <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atmuhammad_nasri_sadi@csa.gov.sg\">atmuhammad_nasri_sadi@csa.gov.sg</email></p>", "publisher": "Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Press Statements", "instances": ["Over the past 30 years, Singapore has shared our development experience with more than 5,800 Pacific officials under the Singapore Cooperation Programme.

Adaptation has historically been underfunded and receives much less financing from the private sector, which has generally channeled capital towards mitigation projects as these tend to be productive assets that can generate an income, such as a solar power plant.  </p><p> Besides the fact that the focus has been on reducing greenhouse gas emissions instead of adjusting to increasing risks of climate change impacts, climate adaptation tends to mean public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems, which do not lend themselves to commercial financing models.</p><p> However, Drew noted during a panel discussion that the investment case for climate adaptation projects comes from the increasing necessity of such goods and services -- with all metrics indicating that the world is not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- and therefore demand for them. </p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Jay Koh, the co-founder and managing director of The Lightsmith Group, said the challenges brought about by climate change present \"unavoidable opportunities\". </p><p> Citing the sixth assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Koh, who runs a private equity firm that focuses on climate resilience solutions, said that the trajectory of climate change between the present day and 2030 is almost entirely baked in by greenhouse gas emissions that have already accumulated. \"So there is a great growth investment opportunity -- that is intertwined with the decarbonisation investment strategies that people are pursuing in the market -- for climate resilience and adaptation solutions,\" said Koh, who was speaking at the same panel. </p><p> One example is an artificial intelligence company that analyses vegetation management for utility companies. Given that many major wildfires in the United States and Australia are sparked by vegetation encroaching onto power lines, most utility companies are managing this problem by having workers manually cut down trees getting too close to the power lines. </p><p> With satellite drone imagery, utility companies are able to manage such risks in a much more efficient way. </p><p> Yet, Drew pointed out that there is still currently a low level of awareness and understanding among financial institutions on what constitutes adaptation finance.</p><p> In the midst of developing the guide, she was often asked by banks and asset managers: \"What do you mean by (adaptation finance)? Do you mean \"loss and damage\"? Isn't that the job of the government'\"</p><p> \"Loss and damage\" refers to a fund, established by countries at the United Nations climate change conference, that will be financed by developed countries to compensate developing countries experiencing the worst impacts of climate change. </p><p> There is therefore a need for the industry to have a common definition of adaptation finance and the commercial opportunities arising from it, as well as an understanding of the financing mechanisms and the type of projects available, said Drew.</p><p> \"Inaction is not a world that you can conceive. It's loss of economic prosperity, it's loss of livelihoods, it's people's health, it's life, et cetera... We can either invest in it now and do it in a nice, orderly way. Or we can wait till it's disaster, and then it's chaos,\" she added.</p><p> The importance of taking adaptation and resiliency actions early is also highlighted by Lubomir Varbanov, Swiss Re's managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific.</p><p> Physical impacts from a climate event can be mitigated if climate resiliency is built into urban planning sufficiently early, he said at the same panel. </p><p> It is a misconception that disaster risk insurance only has a role to play in the aftermath of a climate disaster as a shock absorber, Varbanov noted.</p><p> He cited an example of Swiss Re partnering with local governments in Australia to financially quantify their natural hazard risks. This allows them to pre-emptively identify their highest risk assets across all types of natural disasters and their locations, so as to factor this information into their planning processes.   </p><p> If more action to increase climate resiliency is not taken, the rising costs of insurance will lead to affordability issues, especially for vulnerable communities.</p><p> Varbanov noted that four of the last five years have seen over US$100 billion of insured losses from natural disasters. </p><p> He said that there needs to be more public and private partnerships, where data is shared and common objectives are set. </p><p> An enabling environment, with regulations that promote an open market and optimal price setting that does not make the insurance industry more expensive, are also important. </p><p> Helping livelihoodsOn the issue of policy reforms, Drew noted that local governments often cite how policy suggestions, such as the redirection of subsidies, are politically challenging to implement. </p><p> However, she added that it is important for the private sector and development finance institutions to highlight to policymakers how these policy reforms \"are going to actually create an enormous amount of opportunity for the livelihoods of (their) people\".</p><p> \"So politically, (they're) helping (their) people.

Trump\u2019s standing in American politics is now more powerful than ever with what he calls an \u201cunprecedented and powerful mandate\u201d from the American people. He secured a decisive victory in the presidential election, winning 312 electoral college votes compared to Harris\u2019 226 and becoming the first Republican to win the popular vote since George W.

His officials could possibly provide some restraint on him, but it is reasonable to expect that Trump will act with greater compulsion and fewer restraints on signalled priorities, alongside abiding unpredictability.</p><p>                        Trump 2.0 will be preoccupied with the challenge of delivering his campaign promises to swiftly end the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East.</p><p>                        Southeast Asia is a critical hub in global supply chains, a major player in international trade, the world\u2019s second-largest destination of foreign investments, as well as a focal point in the US-China strategic rivalry. Consequently, the region faces high stakes with the expected policy shifts during Trump\u2019s second term.</p><p>                        Trump\u2019s first presidency provides insights into what may lie ahead. His first term was marked by a disdain for the liberal internationalist principles that have shaped US foreign policy since World War II \u2014 particularly regarding multilateral institutions, alliances and trade. This, along with Trump\u2019s impulsive style, bombastic rhetoric and \u201cAmerica First\u201d transactionalism will continue or even intensify.</p><p>                        Against this backdrop, what does the future hold for Southeast Asia?</p><p>                        This photo illustration shows the front pages of the newspapers in Manila on 7 November 2024 showing the re-election of US President-elect Donald Trump.</p><p>                        Southeast Asia is unlikely to be a priority in Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda. During his first term, Trump\u2019s attendance at ASEAN and APEC summits \u2014 especially the high-profile Trump-Kim meetings in Singapore and Vietnam \u2014 appeared driven more by specific circumstances than a dedicated interest in the region itself, as seen under Obama, or the strategic focus on Southeast Asia\u2019s role in US-China competition under Biden. </p><p>                        Trump 2.0 will be preoccupied with the challenge of delivering his campaign promises to swiftly end the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East. Given Trump\u2019s personal disinterest in the region as well as his scepticism towards multilateralism, the region may face another four years of Trump\u2019s absence at ASEAN summits and minimal direct engagement with Southeast Asian leaders. During his first term, Trump attended only the 2017 ASEAN summit meetings, failed to send a cabinet-level official to subsequent summits in 2019 and 2020, and failed to appoint US ambassadors to ASEAN and Singapore.</p><p>Southeast Asian countries may see a reduction in American development assistance.\u00a0</p><p>                        Trump\u2019s return will also mark a retreat of US global leadership on shared challenges. Under Biden, addressing global issues like climate change and pandemics was elevated as one of the two pillars of its\u00a0national security strategy, alongside great power competition. His administration launched\u00a0various initiatives\u00a0supporting Southeast Asia in areas like climate resilience, smart cities, environmental protection, public health, education, youth leadership and women\u2019s empowerment.</p><p>                        Trump 2.0 may deprioritise these initiatives, given his track record of attempting to\u00a0reduce American foreign aid\u00a0and his scepticism towards climate change, green transition, public health and gender equality. As a result, Southeast Asian countries may see a reduction in American development assistance. The future of significant programmes like the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETP) \u2014 the financing scheme strongly backed by the Biden administration to help\u00a0Vietnam and Indonesia\u00a0transition to cleaner energy sources \u2014 now hangs in the balance.</p><p>                        Trade risks to Southeast Asia</p><p>                        Trade is where the risks to Southeast Asia\u2019s economic well-being are most apparent under Trump 2.0. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) involving seven Southeast Asian states was Biden\u2019s initiative to keep America engaged in regional economic rule-making, without offering a traditional free trade agreement with market access. Trump, who coined it \u201cTPP Two\u201d, may axe it on his first day in office. Although the impact of an IPEF cancellation will be much less profound than the shock of his 2017 withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it would further weaken the US\u2019s commitment to sustain its economic engagement in Southeast Asia.</p><p>                        Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could result in a 3% decline in exports from Asia (excluding China) to the US, and an 8% drop in US exports to those Asian economies.</p><p>                        More critically, Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for tariffs, which he\u00a0called\u00a0\u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, will spell great trouble ahead for the region. His threats to impose sweeping tariffs \u2014 10-20% on all imports and 60% on imports from China \u2013 would trigger disruptions in global trade and growth, severely undercutting the rules-based international trading system that has underpinned Southeast Asia\u2019s economic growth for decades.\u00a0Oxford Economics\u00a0projects that Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could result in a 3% decline in exports from Asia (excluding China) to the US, and an 8% drop in US exports to those Asian economies.</p><p>                        Shipping containers are seen as US President Joe Biden delivers remarks on his administration\u2019s Investing in America agenda at the Port of Baltimore on 29 October 2024 in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>                        Ironically, Southeast Asian countries have largely benefited from the US-China trade war waged by Trump 1.0, which spurred companies to shift supply chains to the region to avoid Trump\u2019s tariff hikes on Chinese goods. US-Southeast Asia trade has grown steadily throughout the Trump 1.0 and Biden administrations, with Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia\u2019s exports to the US almost or more than doubling between 2017 and 2023. These countries, which have large trade surpluses with the US, will come under heightened scrutiny. His first administration labelled Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore as \u201ccurrency manipulators\u201d. They are off the list under Biden but remain under monitoring.</p><p>                        Under the Biden administration, the de-risking of global supply chains due to US-China tensions primarily impacted the semiconductor industry and the green sectors of electric vehicles and solar panels. This left Southeast Asian economies \u2014\u00a0deeply integrated\u00a0into the supply chains linking China and the US \u2014 largely unscathed in most other industries. However, Trump\u2019s proposed tariff hikes on Chinese imports \u2014 and products with significant Chinese components \u2014 combined with the threat of Chinese retaliation, would significantly heighten the risk that the world\u2019s two largest economies may decouple. ASEAN economies, of which China and the US are the largest trading partners, would be caught in the middle. </p><p>                        ASEAN exports to the US rely heavily on Chinese intermediate goods (not to mention the re-routing and relabelling of Chinese goods going to the US via Southeast Asia) and Chinese exports to the US also use raw materials and intermediate goods from ASEAN. A sharp decline in Chinese exports to the US would also negatively impact Southeast Asian exports to China, which in turn would affect overall regional economic performance. In sum, the globalisation model that Southeast Asia has long depended on for growth faces an increasingly uncertain future.</p><p>                        Table 1: Exports to the US from ASEAN and top five Southeast Asian nations</p><p>(2017-2023, US$ billion)</p><p>                        Table 2: Trade surplus with the US by ASEAN and top five Southeast Asian nations</p><p>(2017-2023, US$ billion)</p><p>                        Defence and security: all about China</p><p>                        On the security front, discerning Trump\u2019s approach and potential implications is more complex. On one hand, Trump is deeply sceptical of alliances, often accusing US allies of \u201cfree riding\u201d on America\u2019s defence commitments. This approach threatens the sustainability of the expanded network of US alliances and minilateral coalitions in Asia that Biden has spent years cultivating. </p><p>Manila may need to recalibrate its hardline stance towards China or establish more safeguards to avoid a conflict outbreak, because Trump 2.0 will be less inclined to come to Manila\u2019s rescue in such an event.</p><p>                        The Philippines, in particular, stands to be most impacted. In recent years, it has significantly\u00a0strengthened its alliance\u00a0with the US and joined multiple plurilateral arrangements involving the US and other allies such as Japan and Australia. Manila may need to recalibrate its hardline stance towards China or establish more safeguards to avoid a conflict outbreak, because Trump 2.0 will be less inclined to come to Manila\u2019s rescue in such an event.</p><p>                        On the other hand, balance of power has been central to the US\u2019s strategic competition with China. Recognising this reality, Trump 1.0 invested in building security-defence ties with key Southeast Asian nations. For instance, it transferred two Coast Guard cutters to help bolster Vietnam\u2019s maritime capabilities. </p><p>                        In 2018, the USS\u00a0Carl Vinson\u00a0became the first American aircraft carrier to visit Vietnam since the Vietnam War, followed by the USS\u00a0Theodore Roosevelt\u00a0in 2020. The US also renewed crucial defence agreements with Singapore, including the 2019 memorandum of understanding to extend the use of the island\u2019s air and naval bases by 15 years. </p><p>                        The first Trump administration also raised its stakes in the South China Sea (SCS) by\u00a0significantly increasing\u00a0US freedom of navigation operations in SCS to challenge excessive maritime claims. In 2020, the US State Department issued an important policy\u00a0statement\u00a0regarding maritime claims in the SCS, aligning US policy with the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in favour of the Philippines against China.</p><p>                        Chinese Coast Guard vessels fire water cannons towards a Philippine resupply vessel Unaizah May 4 on its way to a resupply mission at Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea, on 5 March 2024.</p><p>                        The hard-line approach focused on balancing against China will likely intensify in Trump 2.0, given the China hawks potentially forming his national security team, including Vice-President-elect JD Vance, incoming national security adviser\u00a0Mike Waltz, and\u00a0figures\u00a0like Robert O\u2019Brien,\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0or Bill Hagerty. It bears reminding that the paradigm shift in the US\u2019s China policy from engagement to strategic competition started under Trump 1.0, and has now become an organising principle of US foreign policy.</p><p>                        That said, Trump could inject significant uncertainty into this dynamic. His penchant for \u201cdeal-making\u201d raises concerns that he might strike deals with China on issues like Taiwan or the SCS, bypassing regional countries\u2019 interests. Southeast Asia, therefore, continues to oscillate between potentially being drawn into the escalating US-China tensions or potentially being left in the lurch by Trump\u2019s isolationist and unilateralist instincts.</p><p>Singapore supports 270,000 \u201chigh-quality jobs\u201d in the US and is a key gateway for 6,000 American firms in Southeast Asia. Often unsaid but critically, Singapore plays a crucial role in the projection of US power in the region.</p><p>                        The three \u2018Ts\u2019 of managing Trump: trade, transactionalism and team America</p><p>                        Ultimately, no one can be certain as to what Trump would do, given his mercurial nature. But a reasonable assessment is that his approach towards Southeast Asia countries could boil down to a Trumpian triumvirate of \u201cTs\u201d: their trade relations with the US, transactionalism (how Trump assesses a partner country pays its fair share for American defence guarantees), and how far they can align with Team America in its objectives vis-\u00e0-vis China.</p><p>South Korea is a good example. Given its growing\u00a0trade surplus\u00a0with the US, Seoul is considering\u00a0increasing energy imports\u00a0from the US. In October, Trump labelled South Korea a \u201cmoney machine\u201d which could pay US$10 billion annually for hosting US troops. To pre-empt Trump, Seoul recently agreed to raise the figure by 8.3% to US$1.13 billion in 2026 \u2014 though still well below Trump\u2019s figure.</p><p>                        Going by the three \u201cTs\u201d, Southeast Asian countries could see varying fortunes. Non-US allies or those with trade deficits or small surpluses with the US may fly under the radar. Singapore could be well-positioned: it ran a\u00a0US$40 billion trade deficit\u00a0with the US in 2022, and is the third-largest Asian investor in the US. As\u00a0Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\u00a0noted in his congratulatory message to Trump, Singapore supports 270,000 \u201chigh-quality jobs\u201d in the US and is a key gateway for 6,000 American firms in Southeast Asia. Often unsaid but critically, Singapore plays a crucial role in the projection of US power in the region.</p><p>                        A man jogs along the promenade near the financial business district in Singapore on 14 October 2024.</p><p>                        The cases of the Philippines and Vietnam will be more intriguing. The Biden administration\u2019s planned\u00a0US$500 million\u00a0to boost Manila\u2019s military capabilities, on top of US$1.14 billion of US military assistance from 2015-2022,\u00a0may not sit well with Trump. Meanwhile, Vietnam had the\u00a0third-largest trade surplus\u00a0with the US last year, after China and Mexico. Yet, both countries are on the frontlines of the SCS disputes, hence their value to the US\u2019 strategic competition with China. Will they receive a pass due to their geopolitical importance?</p><p>                        Southeast Asian countries navigated Trump 1.0 relatively well and hope they can do the same with Trump 2.0. However, the region should guard against complacency because Trump 2.0 will be far more emboldened and unrestrained. Southeast Asian leaders should leverage their pragmatism, build a good rapport with Trump, and avoid ideological posturing or virtue signalling, as European counterparts often do. While no preparation can fully account for what\u2019s ahead, resilience, adaptability and a cool head will be key to weathering the Trumpian storm.</p><p>                        This article was first published in\u00a0Fulcrum, ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute\u2019s blogsite.</p><p>                        Related: Bracing for Trump 2.0: A world on edge | Tommy Koh: Trump\u2019s second term and its implications for Singapore and ASEAN | Bilahari Kausikan: What does the American presidential election mean for Singapore and Asia?</p><p>                        A woman flies flags from the bed of her pick-up truck outside US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, US, on 11 November 2024.</p>", "publisher": "ThinkChina", "instances": ["Trump\u2019s return will also mark a retreat of US global leadership on shared challenges.

Or the role played by forests as sources of water for city reservoirs. Pollinators, including bees and butterflies, are also vital for crops. In South-east Asia, bats are important pollinators of the durian, the region's spiky delicacy. </p><p> As Ms Jan Yoshioka, vice-president of sustainable finance at non-profit organisation Conservation International's (CI) Asia-Pacific region, put it: \"It is in the self-interest of corporations to adopt environmentally and socially sustainable business practices and to invest in the conservation of the natural resources they depend on.\" </p><p> The realisation that healthy natural ecosystems are key to thriving businesses has put new wind in the sails of the nature conservation movement, widening the circle of those involved beyond just conservationists and governments to include the private sector too. </p><p> Mr Carlos Pagoaga, president of the Coca-Cola Foundation, said nature often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed health and reducing water stress for communities.</p><p> \"The Coca-Cola Foundation, the Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners invest in nature-based solutions, such as forest protection and floodplain management, which build on natural processes to manage water systems,\" he told The Straits Times. </p><p> \"Through this work, we recognise that nature-based solutions often have multiple co-benefits, such as better water quality, carbon sequestration, increased climate resilience, and enhanced richness and variety of life of natural habitats,\" Mr Pagoaga added.</p><p> Do more with nature-based solutionsWhile the intention to contribute to nature's restoration is there, the question is how companies can do so in a more sustained manner than a one-time donation in the name of corporate social responsibility. </p><p> Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Singapore, said: \"In our current market environment, in order to ensure better conservation, we either have to put a price on nature or make it a rule -- or both.\"</p><p> Mr Sivaprasad, who is BCG's South-east Asia lead for climate and sustainability, added: \"This means defining the economic value of things like clean water, air, food security, carbon storage that are enabled by nature and/or creating government regulations that make conservation a requirement.\"</p><p> The close links between the climate and biodiversity crises mean that some financial instruments developed to help companies address climate change are also having positive effects on nature. </p><p> This is most clearly seen in the carbon markets. </p><p> Habitats such as forests and mangroves have the ability to sequester carbon -- or capture and store planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This locks the carbon away from the atmosphere, contributing to climate mitigation. </p><p> One carbon credit represents 1 tonne of planet-warming greenhouse gases that is either prevented from being released, such as when a forest is saved from the axe, or removed from the atmosphere, such as through a forest restoration project.</p><p> Mr Law Heng Dean, managing director of the Singapore office of the Pollination Group, a global climate change investment and advisory firm, said that nature-based solutions to sequester carbon or prevent it from being emitted in the first place could contribute to around 30 per cent of global mitigation needed to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement. </p><p> Companies buy carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint so that they can meet their commitments of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 -- the timeline that could help the world avoid the harshest impacts of climate change, according to the UN's climate science body. </p><p> CI's Ms Yoshioka said a key driver of the increased interest shown by the private sector in nature is its demand for nature-based carbon credits. </p><p> And when companies buy carbon credits to meet their climate targets, nature reaps the dividends: In one area, a forest is saved from the axe. In another, a mangrove is restored. </p><p> Amid the growing consensus that the world cannot achieve net-zero emissions without nature-based solutions, private and public sectors are becoming increasingly involved in nature conservation, said Ms Hoon Ling Min, investment director at investment firm GenZero.</p><p> But between 2010 and 2022, voluntary carbon markets managed to unlock only a fraction of the potential of nature-based solutions, said Pollination's Mr Law. </p><p> Figures from Ecosystem Marketplace, a global environmental finance news and markets analysis site, show that the global voluntary carbon market was worth about US$2 billion in 2022. </p><p> This is nowhere near the US$700 billion the UN says is required every year for nature's protection. </p><p> For the nature funding gap to be narrowed, the private sector needs to be motivated to loosen their purse strings further.</p><p> \"Today, more than 80 per cent of finance to nature comes from public sources; private financing, whether by corporates or financial institutions, remains an under-tapped source,\" Mr Law noted.</p><p> Can companies be convinced that investing in nature is not just about meeting regulatory requirements or avoiding potential losses, but that it could actually help to turn a profit too? </p><p> People, profit and planet As nature's true value -- to lives, livelihoods and bottom lines -- starts to come into focus, attempts are now being made to put a price on nature. </p><p> This ability to capture value in instruments that can be invested in and traded is what the financial sector excels in, said GenZero's Ms Hoon. </p><p> Take, for example, the World Bank's rhino bond, which was issued in 2022 to increase the population of the critically endangered black rhinoceros, native to Africa. </p><p> The five-year US$150 million bond -- the first wildlife conservation bond of its kind -- will pay investors returns based on the rate of growth of black rhino populations at South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park and the Great Fish River Nature Reserve.</p><p> The bond was sold to institutional investors, such as investment firm Nuveen and Mackenzie Investments, and high-net-worth clients from Credit Suisse International and Citi private banking arms. </p><p> Similarly, a newly proposed Indonesia Coral Bond -- another initiative of the World Bank -- will see investors receiving a \"success payment\" at maturity.</p><p> Mr Helge Muenkel, chief sustainability officer at DBS Bank, said: \"Beyond providing essential funding, financial expertise is instrumental in developing innovative financial products that can support nature-based solutions.\"</p><p> Another instrument gaining traction is biodiversity credits.</p><p> These credits come from projects that seek to provide measurable improvements in biodiversity, be they focused on a specific species or across an entire ecosystem.</p><p> The credit is a certificate that a corporate buys representing a specific outcome, such as a measurable improvement to a hectare of forest over 10 years. </p><p> For example, Colombian project developer Terrasos has issued credits that each represents the protection of 10 sq m of conserved or restored ecosystems in a high-conservation area of Colombia for 30 years. </p><p> \"Governments are interested in leveraging biodiversity credits as a mechanism to help drive private sector investment into positive outcomes for nature,\" said Ms Laura Waterford, executive director at the Pollination Group in Australia. </p><p> Corporates and financial institutions were also starting to think about buying biodiversity credits on a voluntary basis as part of their broader nature strategies, she added.  </p><p> Ultimately, the goal is to have a global market in tradeable biodiversity credits, though this will take some more time, given the complexity of measuring the benefits. Ms Waterford said the foundations for effective voluntary biodiversity credit markets could be in place by 2030. </p><p> The pricing complex The emergence of innovative financial instruments like rhino bonds can help to unlock new sources of funding from the private sector for nature's conservation, since firms now have a financial -- not just regulatory -- incentive to do so. </p><p> But these tend to be project-specific, and are challenging to implement on a wider scale. </p><p> Observers point to a few obstacles to scaling them up: the difficulty in measuring impact; the uniqueness and complexities of each and every ecosystem, which makes it difficult to develop replicable models that can be implemented quickly across different regions; and the difference in timelines for nature's recovery against investor expectations. </p><p> \"Where there is a globally agreed upon unit for measuring emissions, reductions and removals, there is currently no common unit of measurement for nature and biodiversity,\" said CI's Ms Yoshioka. </p><p> For carbon credit projects, the unit of measure appears to be straightforward. </p><p> Closing down a coal plant in favour of a solar farm prevents the release of a quantifiable amount of carbon dioxide. </p><p> But developments over the past two years have shown that even the suggestion that a carbon project will not truly deliver climate benefits -- such as carbon credits sold for protecting a forest that was at low risk of being cut down in the first place -- can send carbon markets into turmoil, as buyers fear accusations of greenwashing and reputational backlash. </p><p> This has triggered a major shift towards stronger standards and methodologies that back only high-quality carbon projects -- a much-needed reset for the market, experts say. </p><p> Measuring the impacts of a conservation initiative is much more complicated. </p><p> For example, should the focus be across an entire ecosystem or habitat or specific species? Or should protecting what is left be prioritised, over restoring the degraded parts of the land? </p><p> DBS' Mr Muenkel pointed to how nature conservation projects are influenced by unique cultural, societal and environmental factors. </p><p> Restoring a mangrove in Indonesia, for example, would be vastly different from doing the same in India or Colombia, owing to different species compositions, different drivers of deforestation, different environmental conditions and so on. </p><p> Yet, being able to measure outcomes of conservation interventions will be critical to get investor buy-in. </p><p> \"Scientific robustness, impact measurement and risk management are some of the key factors considered by private entities and financial institutions before making a decision on biodiversity-linked financial products,\" Mr Muenkel said.</p><p> Monitoring mechanisms are also needed to measure the impact of conservation efforts, and independent third-party verification processes help to prevent greenwashing and manage any related reputational risks, he added. </p><p> The Coca-Cola Company, for example, said it is partnering with other organisations to develop a methodology to help it quantify and test the co-benefits of nature-based projects, which can help to provide a means to value social return on investment. This, said a spokesperson, can help to build the business case for nature-based solutions. </p><p> This is all part of efforts by academic institutions, companies and standards bodies to develop common frameworks to govern biodiversity investments to ensure they boost nature, can bring social benefits and that this can be measured and verified. </p><p> Further complicating the situation is that nature's progress is oblivious to investor timelines. </p><p> Mr Mike Ng, group chief sustainability officer at OCBC Bank, said: \"Some nature-related projects also come with long timelines and uncertainty, which may require longer financing timelines than traditional loan tenures. These factors contribute to the lack of bankability for nature conservation projects globally.\" </p><p> A coral reef, for example, can take up to 10,000 years to develop. As the reef accretes, habitat complexity deepens -- providing creatures like shrimp, baby fish and flatworms -- with nooks and crannies to hide and rest in. </p><p> But if that reef is destroyed by trawling or bomb fishing, and reef restoration efforts are needed to help it recover, how long would it take to restore the life that it once held? </p><p> Overcoming roadblocks Despite -- or perhaps because of -- these challenges, new schemes that attempt to put a price on nature continue to bloom. </p><p> One area being explored is to leverage the success of the carbon market and tie biodiversity benefits more closely to carbon financing. </p><p> Carbon credit projects have benefited nature and developing nations for decades, said Mr Duncan van Bergen, co-founder of Calyx Global, which rates carbon credit projects. </p><p> He added that recent innovations focusing on shoring up the climate integrity of credits will help the market scale up, \"maximising its impact and enabling companies to participate with greater assurance\". </p><p> In other words, buyers want to be certain that credits can hold up to scrutiny. Add in nature and social benefits, such as health and education support for local communities, and it is a winning combination. </p><p> For any land-based carbon project, it is now mandatory to include biodiversity and community components, said Mr Pablo Fernandez, chief executive of ecosecurities, a global carbon project developer and advisory firm. </p><p> TNC and its Indonesian partner, Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara, are studying a project concept in East Kalimantan on Borneo island that would conserve a large area of forest but also generate money to compensate several land concession owners. </p><p> Revenue would come from sustainable timber production, carbon credits and payments for biodiversity conservation. </p><p> \"It is hard to change the behaviours in the landscape, whether that is corporate behaviour or a small holder or a government if you are not bringing a viable financial alternative to the table,\" said Mr Will McGoldrick, TNC's managing director for the Asia-Pacific. </p><p> Also in Indonesia, a new effort between CI and its local partner, Yayasan Konservasi Indonesia, aims to combine marine conservation with sustainable fishery practices under its Blue Halo S initiative. </p><p> A grant funding mechanism under the initiative, to be implemented from 2025 to 2031, has received interest from private sector groups, including fisheries and aquaculture technology start-ups, business incubators and impact investors. </p><p> CI's Ms Yoshioka said: \"The (grant facility) aims to improve the climate resilience of around 162,000 Indonesian coastal communities while contributing to the sequestration of more than half a million tonnes of... emissions through restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangrove and seagrass, and improved management of marine protected areas.\"</p><p> Another idea to bridge commercial returns with societal benefits is that of ecotourism, said BCG's Ms Alia Kaz, a knowledge expert in sustainability. </p><p> Scientists, ecologists and organisations involved in nature conservation usually focus on improving a public good. \"They are often funded on the basis of grants with no or limited expectation of economic return. Their work results in societal returns, not commercial returns,\" she said. </p><p> \"But individuals in the private sector and financial sector are measured on commercial returns,\" Ms Kaz added. \"Nature conservation can generate ecotourism and ecotourism-related revenues.\"</p><p> Reining in destructionIncreasing funding for nature conservation, however, is just one part of the picture. </p><p> Figures show that the world is spending much more on activities that damage nature. For one thing, subsidies that drive the destruction of nature -- such as tax breaks and cheap diesel that fail to account for the cost of environmental damage from the fossil fuel, agriculture, water and forestry sectors -- amount to an estimated US$1.8 trillion, a study in 2022 found.</p><p> Activities that cause harm to nature and the subsidies they receive must also be re-evaluated, said Dr Francesco Ricciardi, an environmental specialist working at a developmental organisation. </p><p> Speaking in his personal capacity, Dr Ricciardi said he is doubtful the market can solve environmental issues, since much of nature's degradation is the result of the pursuit for economic growth. </p><p> \"Mining, building roads in pristine rainforests to push mining and logging interests, constructing large dams that bring fish to extinction, these are all still happening now in a bid for more economic growth,\" he said. </p><p> The global reckoning of the value of nature must also consider that the cost of destroying nature -- whether it be clearing a forest for a plantation, discharging pollution into a freshwater stream or spilling oil into the ocean -- is no longer free.</p><p> To move the nature needle, said TNC's Mr McGoldrick, the right regulatory environment is critical. </p><p> \"You have to get the government policy settings right to both incentivise the right type of investment, but also limit or prevent the wrong type of investment,\" he added. </p><p> Where the private sector can come in is in the realm of innovation.</p><p> Dr Alfredo Giron Nava, head of the Ocean Action Agenda at the World Economic Forum, said: \"We cannot achieve the scale needed to increase financing for nature without the private sector. There simply isn't enough development or philanthropic money.\" </p><p> What is needed is a common language between the profit-driven motives of the private sector and conservationists, he added.</p><p> \"Our job is to come up with realistic models, and collaborate with one another to create them, to show that there can be models that are good for nature, are good for business too,\" said Dr Nava. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Mr Carlos Pagoaga, president of the Coca-Cola Foundation, said nature often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed health and reducing water stress for communities. \"The Coca-Cola Foundation, the Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners invest in nature-based solutions, such as forest protection and floodplain management, which build on natural processes to manage water systems,\" he told The Straits Times. Do more with nature-based solutionsWhile the intention to contribute to nature's restoration is there, the question is how companies can do so in a more sustained manner than a one-time donation in the name of corporate social responsibility. Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Singapore, said: \"In our current market environment, in order to ensure better conservation, we either have to put a price on nature or make it a rule -- or both.", "Also in Indonesia, a new effort between CI and its local partner, Yayasan Konservasi Indonesia, aims to combine marine conservation with sustainable fishery practices under its Blue Halo S initiative.

How significant is Singapore's launch of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine to support the cause?</p><p>Climate change is the biggest health threat of the 21st century. It will impact our ability to deliver care and it will increase the need for healthcare. As a result, if we're not careful, we will see further increase in healthcare-related emissions. Singapore, like the rest of Asia-Pacific, is seeing an increase in the effects of climate change that lead to direct impacts on health, like vector-borne diseases and heat-related illnesses. Climate change is also causing more wildfires which are worsening ambient air quality. We have seen, during periods of transboundary air pollution from forest fires, substantial increases in asthma-related presentations. Singapore's launch of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine (CoSM) is highly significant as it addresses this urgency by integrating sustainability into medical education, research, and policy, thereby fostering a culture of sustainability within healthcare.</p><p>The CoSM will pioneer and lead the health profession's response to climate change in Singapore, Asia and across the world.

Could a collective effort alleviate the burden?</p><p>Healthcare is a significant carbon emitter, contributing between 5-7% of global carbon emissions- that is more emissions than shipping and aviation combined. Health systems are exacerbating the threat to human health, undermining their central mission to deliver care for our patients and the public.</p><p>Greenhouse gas emissions in the healthcare system come from a variety of sources. They come from the electricity that is purchased to power hospitals and healthcare centres - which are far more energy intensive than regular buildings, from petrol combusted in ambulances from transporting patients and staff to and from hospitals. A good chunk of carbon comes from the production and movement of drugs and medical supplies. Supply chains represent the most significant part of healthcare-related emissions, but the good news is that the healthcare industry is responding - quickly.</p><p>Anaesthetists are phasing out desflurane, an anaesthetic gas and increasingly replacing it with other clinically equivalent gases with a lower global warming potential. Our use of single-use items in clinical settings is also under increased scrutiny, and we're seeing innovations around this take place.</p><p>Climate change is an immense driver of global inequity. Wealthy nations, to some extent, will have the ability to adapt, but in no way can we completely adapt to unmitigated climate change. It is critical to adapt to the climate impacts that are coming at us, and to prepare our healthcare services to be able to continue delivering during acute events (i.e. floods, storms, supply chain or electrical grid disruptions, etc.) but also endure more chronic impacts.</p><p>A collective effort is absolutely necessary. What is promising is that various governments, health systems and health professionals are starting to organise towards seriously decarbonising, both from a top-down and bottom-up approach. They increasingly appreciate the significant cost savings and health co-benefits that decarbonisation will bring. Bearing witness to this in Singapore- in real time- is incredibly exciting. Markets respond acutely to these shifts. We have seen a sliver of this with inhaled anaesthetics, inhalers, single use devices etc; I trust we will continue to see more positive signals from an industry that indicate a desire to respond synergistically to these developments. After all, carbon literacy among health professionals is fast escalating, disclosure standards are increasingly rigorous; there will be less and less breathing space for greenwashing to exist comfortably, if at all.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from BioSpectrum Asia.

I thank the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), RX, sponsors and partners for the opportunity to join you at the International Built Environment Week Conference.</p><p>THRIVING IN A LOW-CARBON, CLIMATE-IMPAIRED WORLD</p><p>Let me begin with a quick reflection on the state of the planet. It is not in a good place. Climate change is already happening. We are seeing more extreme storms, floods, wildfires, and heat waves. 2024 could be the world's hottest year on record. Tropical cyclones are picking up more energy from warmer ocean waters and intensifying more quickly, leading to major floods. Droughts have become persistent across many parts of the world[1].</p><p>It will only get worse in the coming decades. To mitigate climate change, we need to limit global warming to 1.[5] degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But global temperatures are already 1.1 degrees Celsius higher and are continuing to rise[2]. The main driver of global warming - the emission of greenhouse gases - is also continuing to rise. The climate crisis - and that is exactly what it is - is gathering pace.</p><p>To avert climate catastrophe, the world has been stepping up decarbonisation. As of June 2023, 149 countries have committed to achieve net-zero emissions[3]. In the advanced economies, emissions have fallen to their level of 50 years ago[4]. The share of renewables in global power generation has been growing over the years and surpassed 30% in 20235. The global demand for each fossil fuel - coal, oil, and natural gas - is expected to peak before 20306. Globally, investment in energy transition technologies has surged from US$240 billion in 2012 to US$1.8 trillion in 20237.</p><p>What do these two ongoing trends - climate change and decarbonisation - mean? It is likely that the world will accelerate the current pace of decarbonisation in the face of worsening climate change. We will not sit still. But it is also likely that decarbonisation will not occur at a fast enough pace to stop climate change. We will not act decisively.</p><p>We are thus looking at two scenarios co-existing: a low-carbon world and a climate-impaired world. These are the two futures that Singapore needs to prepare for.</p><p>Preparing for a low-carbon world is both an international obligation and an economic necessity. Two years ago, Singapore committed to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050. We account for only 0.1% of global emissions but every country must do its part. The transition to a low-carbon world will likely entail the biggest economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. Those countries, industries, and businesses that successfully transition towards net-zero will thrive in a low-carbon world. Singapore must ensure that it is among these countries.</p><p>Preparing for a climate-impaired world is an existential issue for Singapore. We are vulnerable to rising sea levels. We are low-lying, with 30% of Singapore less than five metres above mean sea levels. We are vulnerable to severe heat stress. We are a densely populated tropical city subject to urban heat effects and high humidity. We must ensure that we remain a resilient, vibrant and liveable city in a climate-impaired world.</p><p>Finally, Singapore can and must play a constructive role in Asia's transition. Asia accounts for half of global emissions. To mitigate climate change, Asia needs to decarbonise, and the rest of the world must help it to do so. As an international business, financial, transportation and technological hub, Singapore can play a useful role in partnership with others to facilitate Asia's transition.</p><p>In short, we need to fight on three fronts: drive our own transition to net-zero; strengthen our resilience to climate change; and facilitate Asia's transition to a low-carbon future.</p><p>SINGAPORE'S TRIPLE TRANSITION</p><p>Today, I will focus on Singapore's transition to net-zero. In fact, our approach comprises three transitions: a carbon transition; an energy transition; and an economic transition.</p><p>The triple transition will require us to fundamentally rethink the way we produce and consume. I will discuss each transition in turn, using the built environment to illustrate.</p><p>Carbon Transition</p><p>Let me start with the carbon transition, to reduce primary carbon emissions to net-zero across all sectors. As of 2021, primary emissions, or emissions arising from non-electricity related activities, made up 60% of Singapore's total emissions. About 73% of these primary emissions come from industrial activity and 23% from transportation. Buildings account for about 1.5%, and households, waste and water, and others account for the rest.</p><p>The government has been working with various industries on decarbonisation plans and mitigation packages. For instance, we are piloting the use of carbon capture, storage, and utilisation technologies. We are also exploring the use of low-carbon hydrogen for industrial heating, which is a major source of emissions in the manufacturing sector. These efforts will take time. The technologies are nascent, and the cost implications are not trivial.</p><p>The land transportation sector's strategy for decarbonisation is based on cleaner energy and modal shift. For cleaner energy, we will cease the registration of new diesel cars and taxis from next year, and install 60,000 charging points for electric vehicles by 2030. As for modal shift, the aim is for mass public transport to make up 75% of travel at peak hours by 2030.</p><p>For the built environment, the Singapore Green Building Masterplan has set the target to green 80% of our buildings by 2030. To qualify as green, buildings not covered under existing Environmental Sustainability Regulations must be certified under the Green Mark scheme. To obtain Green Mark certification, a building will have to achieve required energy performance standards along with other good sustainability practices such as: one, conducting whole-of-life carbon assessments; two, significantly reducing the embodied carbon in the building's concrete, glass and steel; and three, publishing a transition plan that delineates the steps to deliver a net zero carbon building from 2030.</p><p>I am encouraged that building owners are taking decarbonisation seriously. For example, City Developments Limited has pledged to achieve net zero carbon by 2030 for all its wholly-owned buildings, through onsite or offsite renewable energy sources and carbon offsets. Lendlease, a multinational construction and real estate firm, has set targets to achieve net zero carbon by 2025, and absolute zero carbon - meaning without using offsets - by 2040.</p><p>Energy Transition</p><p>Next, the energy transition, to achieve a resilient net-zero electricity grid and enhance energy efficiency. Electricity generation accounts for about 40% of Singapore's total emissions. Of those emissions, the building sector accounts for nearly one-third. Reducing these emissions is a shared responsibility: the government must progressively shift to a cleaner energy mix at the production stage, while the private sector must enhance energy efficiency at the consumption stage.</p><p>Singapore faces significant disadvantages in producing clean energy. Our average wind speeds are below what is needed for commercial wind turbines. We have no river system with fast flowing water, limiting our hydroelectric potential. We have no conventional underground geothermal energy sources. Solar energy is the most promising option, but its scale is limited by Singapore's dense cloud cover and limited land. Even if we reach the full technical potential for solar deployment by 2050, it will barely meet 10% of our projected electricity demand.</p><p>But we are doing what we can, pursuing multiple avenues to a cleaner grid, while taking into account energy security and cost competitiveness.</p><p>First, we are trying to maximise solar energy through innovative deployment. Singapore is now home to one of the world's largest inland floating solar PV systems. The Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm comprises 122,000 solar panels and spans across an area of about 45 football fields.</p><p>Second, we are looking to import low-carbon electricity from our neighbouring countries. The Energy Market Authority has granted conditional licenses to import a total of 2 gigawatts from Indonesia. Conditional approvals have also been granted to projects importing electricity from Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Just yesterday, we announced that we will raise our ambition and seek to import [6] gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035, up from 4 gigawatts previously.</p><p>Third, we are exploring hydrogen - and its derivatives such as ammonia - as a low-carbon energy source. Hydrogen is relevant for both our energy transition and carbon transition. As a low-carbon energy carrier, hydrogen produces electricity when combined with oxygen in a fuel cell or combusted in a gas turbine. As a low-carbon fuel, hydrogen can be used directly in many industrial processes and transportation. But the technologies to produce, transport, and use hydrogen are nascent and costly. To realise the potential of hydrogen, we are: bringing together academia and industry to scale up hydrogen R&amp;D, and forging international partnerships to build up hydrogen supply chains.</p><p>In particular, Singapore sees strong potential for ammonia - as a hydrogen carrier as well as a fuel for shipping and power. The Energy Market Authority and Maritime Port Authority are selecting a lead developer to provide an end-to-end low-carbon ammonia solution on Jurong Island. If successful, Singapore will be one of the first countries in the world to directly combust ammonia for power generation and deploy ammonia bunkering for international shipping.</p><p>Beyond producing cleaner energy, the energy transition is also about enhancing energy efficiency by users.</p><p>The Singapore Green Building Master Plan will hold buildings to high energy efficiency standards. From 2030, 80% of all new developments by gross floor area must achieve at least 60% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 levels. Achieving this standard will contribute towards eligibility for a bonus gross floor area incentive. Beyond this, BCA will support best-in-class buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 levels by 2030.</p><p>Achieving higher energy efficiency in buildings will require advances in automation systems. Conventional building automation systems are not intelligent enough to achieve multiple objectives like energy efficiency and occupant well-being. A so-called model predictive control solution can do much better, optimising and coordinating air-conditioning, ventilation, lighting and shading, to achieve energy savings of up to 60%. What started as a research project by the National Technological University has since been commercialised and deployed at several buildings, including Jurong Town Hall and the PSA Tuas Port Maintenance Base.</p><p>Economic Transition</p><p>The third transition is economic, to capture new green growth opportunities and restructure the economy to remain competitive in a low-carbon future. Decarbonisation will require broader changes in industrial structure, business processes, and workforce skills.</p><p>The economic transition is about greening the brown and growing the green. We have to progressively decarbonise hard-to-abate carbon-intensive sectors like semiconductors, chemicals, and maritime services. We also have to grow new green sectors like carbon services, green and transition finance, and green ecosystem enablers like Measurement, Reporting and Verification, or MRV, services. The low-carbon economy of the future is likely to look quite different from today.</p><p>Greening the brown is not just about decarbonising Scope 2 emissions but also Scope 3. With the International Sustainability Standards Board requiring Scope 3 reporting, the pressure on companies to clean up their supply chains will increase. In the built environment sector, Scope 3 forms the lion's share of total emissions. These emissions are also hard to abate, like cement and steel. The challenge for companies in Singapore's built environment sector is greater because most of these materials are imported. Our companies would need to work together across the supply chain to explore ideas and push innovation in areas such as low-carbon concrete, electric furnaces, and use of low-carbon hydrogen in steel production.</p><p>KEY ENABLERS FOR THE TRIPLE TRANSITION</p><p>Achieving the triple transition - in carbon, energy and the economy - will require several key enablers:</p><p>* Carbon Pricing. Progressive increases in carbon taxes will send the right price signals for economy-wide decarbonisation.</p><p>*Technology.  Many of the barriers to cost-effective decarbonisation will require significant advances in climate-related technology.</p><p>* Finance. More private capital and innovative financing instruments will be needed to support the triple transition.</p><p>* Data and Disclosure. The disclosure of reliable and comparable sustainability data is necessary to guide and sustain decarbonisation efforts by businesses.</p><p>* Green Procurement. Incorporating sustainability considerations in procurement decisions can be a powerful lever for decarbonisation across supply chains.</p><p>Let me highlight three of the enablers - Technology, Finance, and Data and Disclosure.</p><p>Clean Technology</p><p>To effectively harness technology for decarbonisation, we need to strengthen collaboration across the public sector, industry, and academia.</p><p>The government has been stepping up support for solutions with high levels of technology readiness. BCA has enhanced the funding under its Green Buildings Innovation Cluster or GBIC programme to S$45 million. The enhanced programme will support research into alternative cooling technologies, smart building solutions, and next-generation building ventilation.</p><p>The SMU Connexion building is an interesting project supported by the GBIC programme, deploying a wide range of sustainable technologies. Their smart control system integrates building services with networked sensors for temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and occupancy. By adjusting for outdoor weather conditions, the system avoids overcooling - a common problem in many of our buildings - and thereby minimises energy consumption. The fans in their air-conditioning units are integrated with CO2 sensors, introducing fresh air only when CO2 levels reach the upper range. The SMU Connexion building has achieved an energy efficiency improvement of nearly 65% from the 2005 baseline.</p><p>We are also seeing interesting innovations in buildings to better harness solar energy. At the PSA Tuas Port Maintenance Base, solar PVs are not just being deployed on rooftops, but also on the building's vertical faade. At DBS Newton Green, the PV modules have solar panels on both sides. This enables harvesting not just the sunlight that falls on the roof but also the sunlight reflected from the roof surface.</p><p>Transition Finance</p><p>The challenge in financing decarbonisation is not green finance but transition finance.  Getting financing for fully green activities, like renewable energy deployment, is becoming easier notwithstanding high capital intensity and long payback periods. But financial institutions find it more difficult to assess transition activities - activities that move away from brown but are not yet fully green. Examples include the switch in electricity generation from coal to natural gas, or the use of carbon capture for the combustion of fossil fuels. The question around the pace of decarbonisation is also important. How fast should a company be transitioning, for it to be considered favourably for financing?</p><p>A key enabler for transition finance is international standards. Well-conceived standards enable financial institutions to more confidently invest in a company's decarbonisation. Let me cite an example from the building sector. An international alliance of leading green building rating system organisations has launched a guide to help bridge knowledge gaps[8]. The guide helps institutional investors and financial institutions better understand major building certification systems, and how those certifications align with the goals of sustainable finance.</p><p>Another enabler is taxonomies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, in collaboration with industry, has established the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance. The taxonomy aims to serve as a common reference point for financial institutions to inform their financing decisions. It classifies activities into \"green\", \"red\", and \"amber\", with the last category of \"amber\" signifying activities that are credibly transitional in nature, moving from \"red\" to \"green\". Take for example the renovation of an existing building: it will be considered \"green\" if the renovation enables the building to reach the prevailing Green Mark Certification or align with relevant Climate Bonds Building Criteria; it will be \"amber\" or transition if the renovation leads to at least a 30% reduction in emissions or energy consumption up to the category's sunset date of 2030. It will be \"red\" if it does not meet the above criteria.</p><p>Data and Disclosure</p><p>Finally, data and disclosure. What gets measured gets done and what gets disclosed gets done even better. The disclosure of reliable and comparable sustainability data is a powerful tool to accelerate the triple transitions. It enables companies to benchmark themselves to their competitors. It enhances supply chain accountability and management of Scope 3 emissions. It helps governments to prioritise their decarbonisation efforts. It helps sectoral regulators to calibrate their emissions or efficiency-related requirements. It enables financial institutions to make more informed sustainable financing decisions.</p><p>As a key step towards a robust data and disclosure ecosystem, Singapore will introduce mandatory climate-related reporting. From FY2025, all listed issuers will be required to make annual climate-related disclosures, aligned with ISSB standards. From FY2027, all companies with annual revenue of at least $1 billion and total assets of at least $500 million will be required to do the same.</p><p>BCA has taken steps to increase the transparency of buildings' energy performance. Building owners can benchmark the performance of their buildings to the top quartile of buildings in Singapore using the BCA's Building Energy Benchmarking Report.</p><p>CLIMATE RESILIENCE</p><p>I have not touched on adaptation and resilience strategies to deal with the physical effects of climate change.</p><p>Even as it plans for the triple transition, the built environment sector must prepare for climate resilience. Many of Singapore's climate vulnerabilities, like heat stress and rising sea levels, will have a significant impact on the built environment. This is why all new developments are required to be built on higher platforms, at least four metres above mean sea levels. Critical infrastructure will be built an additional metre higher. The sector must also prepare for the effects of heat stress on related industries like construction. As our climate continues to deteriorate, even more adaptation measures may be required in the built environment sector in future. In short, resilience must become an integral part of our transition planning.</p><p>THE FOURTH TRANSITION</p><p>I have spoken about our triple transition - carbon, energy, and economic. I have also touched on three key enablers for this transition - technology, finance, and data and disclosure.</p><p>Perhaps there is a fourth transition that the world and Singapore need to make - a transition in mindsets. It begins with building awareness - that climate change is no longer a prediction but a current reality that will progressively worsen. We need to transition from short-term thinking to long-term thinking. The time for action is not 2030 or 2050, but now.  We need to transition from viewing carbon as a constraint on economic growth to viewing low-carbon as a source of competitive advantage. This is how many of the most progressive companies in the world are approaching the issue. We need to transition from seeing decarbonisation purely as a cost to seeing it as an investment in future growth. Finally, we need to transition from considerations based purely on self-interest to collective interest.</p><p>We must transition because it is the right thing to do - for our people and our planet.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] State of the Global Climate 2023, World Meteorological Organisation</p><p>[2] NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies</p><p>[3] Net Zero Stocktake 2023, New Climate Institute, Oxford Net Zero, Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit and Data-Driven EnviroLab</p><p>[4] CO2 Emissions in 2023, IEA</p><p>[5] Renewables &amp; Power Trends Report, Rystad Energy</p><p>[6] World Energy Outlook 2023, IEA</p><p>[7] Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024, BloombergNEF</p><p>[8] Financing Transformation: A Guide to Green Building for Green Bonds and Green Loans</p><p>[Category: Construction &amp; Materials, Engineering &amp; Construction, Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: National Climate Change Secretariat,Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["BCA has taken steps to increase the transparency of buildings' energy performance.

Good afternoon. I am happy to join you here at the 2024 National Engineers Day Engineering Innovation Challenge. Let me first begin by congratulating all our young engineers here with us today! Over 200 teams submitted projects for the challenge this year, and there was a wide range of high-quality projects showcased today. These projects exemplified the spirit of innovation and persistence that underpin good engineering. You identified a problem, developed a good understanding of the theoretical and technical challenges involved, came up with creative solutions, and took practical steps to test out these solutions and turn them into reality.</p><p>Engineering as the foundation of our future</p><p>2. The engineering approach to solving problems and improving processes has contributed greatly to our progress as a society. It begins with being observant of the everyday challenges faced by those around us. For example, the team from ITE College East came out with a good solution to help the visually impaired to navigate around more safely. While canes or guide dogs can help the visually impaired navigate around effectively, these aids don't do well in detecting obstacles that are higher up, closer to their upper body or head. One of the things that inspired them to start the project was reading a report from the Straits Times of a visually impaired person who got a head injury after knocking into an obstacle. The ITE team then drew inspiration from the concept of echo-location, designed and prototyped a Smart Mobility Aid to help the visually impaired identify hazards and avoid danger. This project is a good reminder that being a good engineer is not just about knowing science and technology, but having the drive to find practical solutions to improve the lives of those around us.</p><p>3. We know that Singapore is a small country with many constraints - we have land constraints. We also have labour constraints; with aging, there are more and more people that are getting older and our local workforce will not keep growing. We will hit a saturation point, after which the size of the local workforce will start to decline. We also have a new constraint - carbon constraint. If we want to achieve our goal of net-zero by 2050, we cannot do things as usual. So what we need to do is to work with all of you, and our companies and workers, to find innovative solutions that can help us to tackle the problems of today, and seize opportunities tomorrow.</p><p>4. The theme of this year's competition, \"Innovating a Circular Economy through Engineering\" is timely. Engineering innovations will be critical to supporting our economic ambitions and global competitiveness, while also strengthening climate resilience and resource efficiency. We should not see reaching net zero and protecting the environment as at odds with economic growth. If we do it well, they can be mutually supporting and reinforcing - growing in a sustainable way, and in a manner which still protects the environment. This is what we hope to do with the right solutions.</p><p>5. Many of the projects I saw today involved reducing waste, and creative reuse of materials. Nationally, this is also something that we are pursuing in a big way. For example, we have been reusing recyclable materials from Pulau Semakau - Singapore's only landfill - to reclaim land for the construction of Tuas Port. For those of you may not be aware, we are currently building the world's largest container port - the Tuas Port. When completed in the 2040s, it will have a capacity of 65 million TEUs. To reclaim the land to build the port, a lot of materials are needed. If we can reuse some of the landfill materials from Pulau Semakau, we would be killing two birds with one stone - by extending the life of the landfill, while also reducing the amount of sand required for Tuas Port reclamation and construction. It is a win-win, but this is not easy because it needs to be done properly.</p><p>6. We are now studying the possibility of mixing cement with landfill waste, such as incineration ash and wastewater, as a more sustainable alternative to conventional materials like sand. Our engineers are hard at work to see how we can achieve something that would be good for Singapore, supporting our development in a more resource constrained world.</p><p>Nurturing future generations of engineers</p><p>7. To continue driving such innovations, the key is to have a strong core of engineers. It is the engineers and the people behind that the ideas that can make the project work. I'm heartened that IES has been successfully organising the Engineering Innovation Challenge for the past decade, to inspire our students with the possibilities of engineering, and to encourage them to consider a future in engineering fields.</p><p>8. This is but one of the many initiatives by IES to build a talent pipeline needed across various sectors of our economy. For example, IES has partnered with ITE to jointly develop certification courses for Technical Officers in Mechanical &amp; Electrical engineering, and Civil &amp; Structural engineering.</p><p>9. Speaking for our public transport sector, a strong pipeline of talent is crucial in helping us to provide a core service for Singaporeans. From the challenges of building rail lines in a densely -populated city, to maintaining the intricate mechanical and electrical systems required to keep our rail network operating smoothly, engineers play a critical role to keep Singapore moving. The same is true for the development and operation of our airport and seaports. As we continue to strengthen our connectivity, engineers will have many opportunities to make a difference to the lives of fellow Singaporeans. At the airport and seaports, we are also embarking on automation projects that will allow us to improve productivity and reduce labour costs.</p><p>10. I am also glad that IES will be launching a new Scholarship Fund to provide financial assistance to deserving students to pursue engineering studies. I thank the donors for their generous contribution to the fund, and for nurturing the aspirations of our next generation of engineers, so that they too can contribute back to our community.</p><p>Concluding Remarks</p><p>11. I encourage our young student engineers to make the best use of these opportunities to pursue your dreams. Your journey as an engineer certainly does not end today. I hope that each of you will continue to pursue your interests in engineering in one way or another, and challenge yourselves to continue innovating and exploring the limitless possibilities within the field.</p><p>12. Let me conclude by once again thanking all students for participating in this year's Engineering Innovation Challenge. I look forward to seeing more of your great ideas come to life, and your contributions to a more sustainable, prosperous Singapore.</p><p>13.

Disasters supercharged by climate change are now so frequent it is hard to keep track of them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But beyond the headlines and the immediate crisis is the real story and the greatest impact of climate change: As climate-linked disasters become more frequent and severe, so do the impacts on people, livelihoods, and communities. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The costs are immense and long-lasting. From physical and mental health of victims and their families, to damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure. Food and energy supplies are disrupted and the cost of rebuilding, especially for those without insurance, can be crippling for victims and local governments. Hurricane Beryl provided a bitter reminder. </p><p> 'Blunt force trauma'In an emotional video message on July 17, the United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell, who is from Grenada, spoke from the shattered remains of a neighbour's house on the flattened island of Carriacou. </p><p> \"My own grandmother's house down the street has been totally destroyed.Initial reports are that 98 per cent of homes and buildings have been either destroyed or severely damaged by Beryl.\" </p><p> The devastation, he said, has become all too familiar to hundreds of millions of people around the world. </p><p> \"These colossal climate costs have reached the level of severe national security threat in every country.These climate-driven disasters don't just cripple lives and communities when they hit. They inflict huge ongoing costs the world over. </p><p> \"If governments everywhere don't step up, every economy and eight billion people will be facing this blunt force trauma head on, on a continuous basis.\"</p><p> Poorer nations often fare far worse in the aftermath of major climate-linked events. The 2022 floods in Pakistan lasted four months, inundated a third of the country, displaced millions and destroyed farmland and livelihoods in a disaster felt to this day. Total economic costs were estimated at US$30 billion. </p><p> In India, relentless heat in recent months has killed more than 100 people and more than 40,000 were estimated to have suffered heat stroke. </p><p> The economic and human costs are piling up in wealthy nations, too. In 2023, there were a record 28 weather and climate disasters in the United States, costing at least US$92.9 billion. Severe thunderstorms alone caused US$66 billion in overall losses, of which US$50 billion was insured, according to global reinsurer Munich Re. </p><p> Globally, natural disasters caused US$250 billion in losses in 2023, of which 76 per cent were weather-related. </p><p> In 2022, more than 60,000 people were estimated to have died during the brutal summer heatwaves and fires that scorched Europe, while record wildfires burned millions of hectares across Canada in 2023. </p><p> \"An increase in disasters leads to higher damages and higher economic costs,\" said Mr Ernst Rauch, chief geo and climate scientist at Munich Re. </p><p> More frequent and more intense disasters could mean lengthy recovery periods, he told The Straits Times. He cited labour shortages or the availability of construction materials to rebuild as among the reasons for this.</p><p> The financial health of the affected community also plays a crucial role in how quickly normal operations can resume. </p><p> What can be done'Plenty can be and is being done. </p><p> Nations need to urgently boost resilience to weather disasters to reduce the impacts. This means strengthening building codes, better urban planning such as deeper drainage, hardening electricity grids, such as putting power lines underground in some cases, elevating trunk roads and building storm-proof community shelters that can also double up as cooling centres during heatwaves. </p><p> And it makes financial sense to do so. </p><p> A 2024 study by Allstate, the US Chamber of Commerce and the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation, found that every US$1 spent on climate resilience and preparedness saves communities US$13 in damage, cleanup costs and economic impact.</p><p> Better early warning systems are also key. The UN Secretary-General has called for every person on the planet to be protected by early warning systems by 2027. Advances in early warning systems and preparedness have saved tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). </p><p> The positive sideEarly warning systems likely saved hundreds of lives during Beryl's rampage through the Caribbean, said Mr Kamal Kishore, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. </p><p> And while the aftermath of a disaster can be painful, he tells ST that nations are increasingly focused on resilient recovery -- building back better to withstand the next disaster. </p><p> \"In a very sustained way, many countries are actually putting a lot of focus on recovery and reconstruction,\" he said. And the payoff, if the rebuilding is done right, is stronger infrastructure and better livelihood outcomes and an economic boost. </p><p> \"It's not always the speed of recovery. What we are looking for is the quality of recovery, so that this recovery is resilient, and what we rebuild lasts for 20 years, 50 years, for multiple generations,\" said Mr Kishore, who is also head of the UNDRR. </p><p> Government agencies and insurance firms can help take the lead in boosting resilience. </p><p> On July 10, 2024, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) announced a rule change that requires the agency to factor in the impact of climate change on future flood risk when it decides where and how to build. All construction projects funded by Fema must be strengthened against climate-related flood impacts, including sea-level rise.</p><p> Mr Rauch said there was a need for a dedicated risk manager at the community decision-making level, similar to how the private sector relies on risk managers. </p><p> \"Next, stop allowing construction in high-hazard zones in the first place, keeping in mind that climate change is, at the same time, redefining these zones.</p><p> \"Then after an event: build back better. Preventing building permits in high-hazard zones would have an immediate effect on reducing exposure. The insurance industry (globally) has been successful in promoting more stringent building codes and defining hazard zones,\" he said. </p><p> The long and costly aftermath of most weather-related disasters shows climate change is far from a transient phenomenon typified by short-lived headlines. With millions affected every year, investment in resilience and reducing risks is vital. There is an urgent need to boost climate finance for the poorest and most vulnerable communities across the globe. </p><p> And here the media can also play a role in tracking the aftermath of disasters, to tell the human and economic story as a way for others to learn and see the full, unvarnished consequences of climate change and the need for global action. </p><p> \"Recovery is by definition a longer-term effort,\" said Mr Kishore. \"It would be good to look at how decisions taken in the early phase of recovery lead to good or not so good outcome for the people who are affected. We want to hear people's stories, whether their hopes and aspirations are being met.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["This means strengthening building codes, better urban planning such as deeper drainage, hardening electricity grids, such as putting power lines underground in some cases, elevating trunk roads and building storm-proof community shelters that can also double up as cooling centres during heatwaves.

Scaling innovative finance mechanisms -- such as blended finance, carbon credits and project financing -- will be crucial to ensure that investors have sufficient incentives and business cases to fund.</p><p> Take the project financing for the Phu Yen solar power plant in Vietnam as an example. </p><p> Not only is the plant helping to significantly reduce the country's emissions, but it is also one of the largest solar-powered facilities in Asean and Asia's first \"green B\" loan certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative.</p><p> Blended finance is also set to play an important role. This leverages catalytic capital -- which carries slightly lower financial returns in favour of social and environmental impacts aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals -- to de-risk projects and reduce costs of capital, attracting more private sector funding.</p><p> Take for example the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) for fossil fuel phase-outs and renewable energy investments. Alongside our JETP partners, which include governments and monetary authorities, as well as fellow private sector financiers, we have committed a combined US$15.5 billion to support Vietnam's energy transition and US$20 billion to help Indonesia phase out coal energy and invest in renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p> By scaling concessional capital and other enablers, up to US$20 billion for blended finance per year could become available for decarbonisation opportunities in Asean, if a common approach is developed for the region.</p><p> The priority now is to scale blended finance beyond single projects. To replicate blended finance structures, a framework needs to be developed to encompass different forms of catalytic capital, matching investments with appropriate projects and attracting commercial capital in the right way.</p><p> This ecosystem would include the private and public sectors, supported by efficient long-term policies and regulations aimed at simplifying the decarbonisation agenda for investors.</p><p> Leading the charge is Singapore, which is host to one of Asean's leading blended finance initiatives. </p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is mobilising up to US$5 billion as part of Financing Asia's Transition Partnership, or FAST-P, a regional blended finance platform that will contribute significantly to Asean's sustainability ambitions.</p><p> Climate action as a joint effortBeyond its financial contribution, Singapore is also well-suited as a super-connector between Asean and the world, given its strengths in long-term planning and consensus building.</p><p>Singapore's example shows that collaboration is vital: building resilience to climate change goes beyond siloed action. There's more to be achieved from collective efforts, across Asean and the rest of the world, and between the public and private sectors.</p><p> In this equation, the role of financial institutions is key. </p><p> As the only international bank with a presence across all Asean markets, Standard Chartered plays an important role in facilitating capital to support corporate emissions-reduction efforts. We're committed to mobilising US$300 billion in sustainable finance by 2030, and directing capital and climate solutions to where they are needed most. </p><p> Our long-established relationships with governments, companies and investors mean we also add value by bringing them together. Whether helping to scale the carbon market through our founding partnership in Climate Impact X (a Singapore-based global marketplace, exchange and auction house for trusted carbon credits), or our participation in MAS' Transition Credits Coalition (which aims to expedite the phase-out of coal-fired power plants), we continue to work closely with our partners to help finance the green transition and boost climate resilience.</p><p> For collaborative projects such as these to reach their potential, a unified approach is crucial. This would encompass standards, incentives and disclosures that all markets in Asean, and globally, can adopt and follow.</p><p> Stakeholders across Asean understand the importance of the climate agenda and are planning commitments and investments to reach a sustainable future. But at the same time, we must recognise the challenges ahead.</p><p> Acting now and collaborating to build momentum will give us our best chance at achieving our climate goals.</p><p> When there's a will there's a way, and across Asean, there is no shortage of will. I am confident that it has a bright future as a sustainability leader.</p><p> The writer is CEO, Singapore and Asean, Standard Chartered</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["We're committed to mobilising US$300 billion in sustainable finance by 2030, and directing capital and climate solutions to where they are needed most.

It is my pleasure to join all of you for this year's Singapore Sustainability Scholarship Award Ceremony.</p><p>2. I am glad to meet our young Singaporeans here today who are pursuing a career in environmental sustainability. Congratulations to our newest scholarship recipients! A warmwelcome to our MSE family! Today, we also have our in-service scholars here with us. Theyhave contributed well to their respective organisations and have been selected to develop themselves further in their areas of expertise. Our in-service scholarship is a testament to MSE family's commitment to continually develop and nurture our officers along the course of their careers. Each generation of scholars plays a crucial role in advancing MSE family's mission and vision. In the same way, we are committed to nurturing and preparing future scholars to ensure they are well-equipped to continue and build on the progress made by their predecessors.</p><p>Singapore's Sustainability Journey</p><p>3. Singapore is regarded as one of the cleanest and greenest cities in the world. Our sustainable development strategies over the years have helped to lay a good foundation upon which our economic and social achievements today are anchored. But we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.</p><p>4. Climate change and its impacts are increasingly felt in Singapore and around the world. Sea levels are rising and extreme weather events have increased in both frequency and intensity. We are seeing hotter weather, heavier rainstorms and longer drier periods. Being a low-lying island state, Singapore is especially at risk. Climate change can disrupt global supply chains and threaten our food and water supply.</p><p>MSE Family Scholars in Diverse Areas of Work</p><p>5. Multi-disciplinary expertise is required to address the increasingly complex environmental challenges of our time. Through the Singapore Sustainability Scholarship, we hope to nurture future leaders to strengthen Singapore's climate, economic and resource resilience. We need officers with: deep skill sets in many science and technical areas, and the ability to bridge different disciplines, lead project teams and communicate effectively with our stakeholders.</p><p>Singapore Sustainability Scholarship recipients</p><p>6. This year, we are awarding scholarships to 17 outstanding individuals to pursue courses in earth and planetary science, molecular and cell biology, alongside other science and engineering disciplines. Alicia The, who did an internship with NEA, found the work to be so meaningful that she decided to pursue a career with NEA. She hopes to use science to tackle Singapore's environmental issues and create a more sustainable future for our home. Alicia will be pursuing a Master of Science in Environment Science at the University of St Andrews.</p><p>7. We also have Melissa Koi, PUB's scholarship recipient who will be pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Environmental Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University. From a young age, Melissa has had a passion for environmental conservation. This drove her to pursue a Diploma in Environment and Water Technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic instead of taking the conventional Junior College route. Melissa's studies will help her learn and understand more about rising sea levels and we look forward to her contributions in coastal protection and sustainability upon graduation.</p><p>8. Some of us would be familiar with Abie Chi who represented Singapore in gymnastics. Shifting her focus to food security, she is one of SFA's scholarship recipients this year. Abie will be pursuing a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Her studies will equip her with necessary skills to address Singapore's food safety challenges. Her future involvement in research projects will enable her to contribute innovative solutions from a veterinarian's perspective.</p><p>In-service Scholarship recipients</p><p>9. Our MSE family believes in life-long learning and committed to nurturing a future-ready workforce. This year, we have offered in-service scholarships to 13 of our officers from MSE, NEA, PUB and SFA.</p><p>10. Ackburally Mohammad Djamil is from NEA's Vector Control Operations Division. He is responsible for designing strategies and executing plans to keep vector population low in Singapore. He will be pursuing a Master of Public Health at the National University of Singapore. The Master programme will enhance Djamil's ability to devise and execute current, and robust plans to control the vector population.</p><p>11. Faisal Ahmad oversees PUB's Smart Operations Division in its Infotech and Digitalisation Department, and implements enterprise digitalisation projects to build a future-ready PUB. Faisal will be pursuing a Master in Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Development at University College London. He hopes to better integrate AI into PUB's core operations.</p><p>12. Ong Yihang is from SFA's Urban Food Solutions Division and he is exploring the production of microalgae-based single-cell protein as a sustainable feed ingredient for Asian seabass. Yihang will pursue a Master of Engineering (Chemical and Biomedical Engineering) at the Nanyang Technological University. His work will pave the way for further research and innovation in sustainable protein sources for our aquaculture industry.</p><p>13. While our scholars may come from diverse backgrounds, they have in common a passion for our shared commitment to build a more environmentally sustainable and resilient future for Singapore. Our MSE family's Singapore Sustainability Scholarship and in-service scholarship offer curious minds and passionate individuals the opportunity to pursue their dreams and develop their capabilities to help Singapore navigate the increasingly complex climate challenges ahead of us.</p><p>MSE Family Employee Value Proposition</p><p>14. MSE family's recently updated Employee Value Proposition is \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday\". This proposition aptly reflects our shared mission to drive sustainability initiatives, enhance water, food and climate resilience, to improve the everyday lives of Singaporeans. One of our core promises is to enable our officers to do work rooted in purpose. The earlier examples I shared demonstrate how our scholars and officers can make a direct and meaningful impact by securing the food we eat, the water we drink and the environment we live in. Our work can be challenging, but at the same time, fulfilling and satisfying knowing that what we do contributes towards a greater mission of making our nation a better and liveable home for our current and future generations.</p><p>15. Innovation is another core value of ours. In the face of an uncertain future and global changes, we must remain forward-thinking and seek new solutions to address evolving challenges. We are dedicated to our officers' continuous growth and learning.</p><p>16. As a team, we look out for one another and strive towards an inclusive, safe and supportive MSE family that values our staff and prioritises workplace safety and health.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>17. Let me conclude by once again congratulating all our scholars. Today is a significant milestone for all of you, and you would not be where you are today without the support of your family and loved ones along the way. Do also take time to reflect on the support and guidance you have gained from your teachers and colleagues.</p><p>18. The journey ahead can be both challenging and exciting for the MSE family as we press on in tackling a wide range of challenges - from public health, carbon mitigation, coastal protection, circular economy, as well as food and water security.</p><p>19. I look forward to your contributions to help build a green and sustainable Singapore. I sincerely hope that you find meaning and purpose in your career with us.

He also highlighted the need for SIDS to work together on climate change, digitalisation, and other global challenges. Minister Maliki announced Singapore\u2019s new technical assistance package, \u201cSIDS of Change\u201d, which aims to better equip SIDS to implement the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS to achieve a more resilient and prosperous future. The technical assistance package will include customised courses on blue carbon and digitalisation.

I am glad to see that SIDS have since made strides in their development. The 2022 UN Secretary-General\u2019s Report on the Follow-up to and Implementation of the SAMOA Pathway showed that most SIDS are progressing in sustainable energy, food security and nutrition, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, as well as water and sanitation.</p><p>3-But our work is far from over. Over the last decade, new issues have arisen and the past few years have been particularly challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic, sharpening geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, climate change, and food and energy insecurity have been major threats. New issues such as technology and AI have also emerged, which present both opportunities and challenges. As the SAMOA Pathway draws to a close, we need to refresh our approach and strengthen our partnerships to deal with this new environment and accelerate progress towards the SDGs.</p><p>4-We therefore strongly welcome the adoption of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS, our programme of action for the next decade. This action-oriented document highlights emerging issues that we must collectively address, and which also require strong support from the international community for SIDS. Let me share Singapore\u2019s views on two emerging challenges for SIDS.</p><p>5 -First, climate change. SIDS are on the frontline of feeling the impacts of climate change. We are increasingly affected by tropical cyclones, storm surges, droughts, and changing precipitation patterns, as documented by the IPCC and which we have all experienced acutely. Last year was the warmest year globally. The IPCC\u2019s forecast of global mean sea-level rise of up to 1.1 metres by 2100 would be a disaster for many of us. Adaptation is clearly an urgent priority for SIDS. Singapore therefore fully supports the ABAS\u2019 call for timely support for action on adaptation, including the operationalisation and implementation of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience. In addition, SIDS must work together to push for a successful COP-29 in Azerbaijan which ensures all countries fulfil their climate pledges to keep the Paris Agreement temperature goal of 1.5\u00b0C within reach.</p><p>6-Second, digitalisation. Singapore agrees with the ABAS\u2019 recommendation to harness digital technologies to achieve sustainable development. The ITU has reported that internet use in SIDS since 2014 has grown faster than global growth, at an annual growth rate of 8.4 percent. This is encouraging as connectivity is the enabler for digital transformation, which could yield economic benefits. For example, the UNDP projected that the adoption of financial digital public infrastructure can contribute to 20 to 33 percent of economic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Singapore\u2019s experience in adopting mobile banking and digital payment systems such as the Singapore QR code \u2013 the world\u2019s first unified national e-payment system \u2013 has been a positive one as it allowed us to scale up e-payments and create innovative business opportunities.</p><p>7-In the spirit of South-South cooperation, Singapore is contributing our digital solutions for healthcare, electronic verification, and accessibility to the UNDP\u2019s and ITU\u2019s open registries of digital public goods. To reap the full benefits of digitalisation, SIDS should also create an enabling environment to foster innovation, while promoting digital inclusion to ensure that no one is left behind in this digital revolution. To this end, Singapore and the UNDP have been working on a joint challenge where innovative solutions from SIDS on managing coastal risk and transport infrastructure can be showcased and applied.</p><p>Mr President,</p><p>8 No SIDS can tackle these challenges alone. As a tiny island-state, Singapore understands the unique challenges faced by SIDS. We have benefitted much in learning from other countries during our development journey and are happy to share our experiences. We echo the call in the ABAS to strengthen partnerships for human resource development as this is also reflected in Singapore\u2019s belief that a country\u2019s most valuable asset is its human capital. Singapore has been offering technical assistance packages for SIDS since 1999, in response to the evolving challenges. For example, the Singapore Partnership for the SAMOA Pathway, which we launched in 2019, offered tailor-made programmes including on climate change and disaster risk reduction. I am glad that more than 2,200 officials have participated in this programme. As we prepare for the challenges of the coming decade, I am pleased to announce Singapore\u2019s new technical assistance package for SIDS, which we call \u201cSIDS of Change\u201d. This package includes new customised programmes on emerging issues such as blue carbon and digitalisation. We will also continue to sponsor civil aviation and maritime fellowships for SIDS officials to build up capabilities in these important areas that will enhance our connectivity. We invite all SIDS to participate actively in these programmes.</p><p>9 Thank you.</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Press Statements", "instances": ["1 metres by 2100 would be a disaster for many of us.

And despite its seeming strength, the US jobs market is simply reflecting the recouping of about 22 million jobs lost when the pandemic struck. The tight labour market is symptomatic of a worker shortage as a growing share of the US population ages into retirement.</p><p> \"Something has changed -- and it's structural in nature,\" the report said, referring to the investment environment. \"We are on a weaker growth path and got here with more inflation, higher interest rates and much higher debt levels. The upshot for investors? We think the key is to focus on how the economy and markets are adjusting to the new regime. Adopting the typical cyclical playbook may be misguided.\"</p><p> BII warned that exposures to macro risk can be punished as well as rewarded, and advised investors to be deliberate about what they take on. </p><p> \"We believe the new regime rewards an active approach to portfolios. We don't see one-and-done strategies working as in the past.\"</p><p> Explaining the findings of the report to The Straits Times, BII's chief investment strategist for Asia-Pacific Ben Powell (no relation to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell), said portfolio construction should also take into account a higher interest rate environment.</p><p> \"Our view is that the Fed will cut rates later than the market is expecting, and by less,\" he added.</p><p> Many analysts believe the Fed could start cutting its key lending rate by 100 basis points in 2024, starting in June 2024.</p><p> In its report, BII advised investors to go beyond traditional building blocks and transcend traditional asset classes. It called for a focus on \"mega forces\" such as digital disruption, artificial intelligence (AI), the future of finance, the impact of ageing populations and the push towards climate resilience. </p><p> \"Mega forces are key drivers of the new regime, affecting the long-term growth and inflation outlook and creating shifts in profitability.

A rewiring of economic ties along geopolitical lines could create investment opportunities.</p><p> Mr Powell, who is based in Singapore, said that in the Asia-Pacific region, countries like Vietnam and Malaysia could benefit from the China-plus-one strategy being adopted by global companies.</p><p> One country that he is particularly bullish about is India.</p><p> \"India is in an unusual situation,\" he said. While it is deeply embedded in the US ecosystem via the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue -- comprising India, Australia, Japan and the US -- it also \"practises astute multilateralism that enables (it) to have free conversation and connections with other geographies\". </p><p> \"We see India as being strongly positioned to capitalise on its multilateral relations at a time when the world is drifting apart,\" he said. </p><p> Farther afield, Mr Powell also sees Mexico benefiting from \"near-shoring\" by the US.</p><p> China's October 2022 reopening has not delivered, he added. </p><p> \"The property situation remains unresolved and this presents a problem for Chinese risk assets. More fiscal stimulus is needed to restore confidence,\" he said. </p><p> On real estate, BII noted that valuations have adjusted to the higher inflation and interest rate environment. Real estate investment trusts have reacted to rising interest rates better and further, thus making them more attractive investments. </p><p> From a tactical viewpoint, BII is underweight on most developed market (DM) equities, except for Japan.</p><p> \"We upgraded Japan twice this year on appealing valuations, earnings growth, and as corporate reforms aimed at boosting shareholder take root. It remains our strongest DM equity view. Investors are latching on, partly explaining the broad market's surge this year,\" it said.</p><p> It is also overweight on short-term government credit and inflation-linked bonds. As for finance, it sees the private market -- especially private credit -- competing with the traditional banking sector. </p><p> BII concluded that an increasingly competitive and volatile world could see a surge of investment in strategic sectors like tech, energy, defence and infrastructure.</p><p> \"We also see opportunities in firms with expertise in managing and reducing cyber-security risks.

All other UOB credit and debit cards offer fuel discounts of up to 17 per cent. The bank also has a similar tie-up with the Singapore Petroleum Company (SPC). </p><p> Petrol-related billings on the UOB One credit card rose by over 30 per cent from 2021 to 2023, and nearly 10 per cent on the UOB Reserve card. </p><p> Ms Jacquelyn Tan, UOB's head of group personal financial services, said: \"We are seeing a continuation of this upward trend in the first quarter of 2024.\" </p><p> Rising prices are also contributing to motorists' growing expenditure on petrol. For example, national data in May showed that petrol prices increased at a faster pace and contributed to higher private transport inflation. </p><p> Meanwhile, Ms Tan said that while petrol-related spending remains strong, UOB has also observed a growing popularity of EVs and EV charging.</p><p> EV-related billings on the UOB One credit card and UOB Evol card doubled from 2022 to 2023. The number of card holders spending on services related to EV charging increased by more than 130 per cent. </p><p> At DBS Bank and POSB, card holders receive discounts at SPC and Esso stations. POSB Everyday Card customers can access higher fuel savings, of up to 20.1 per cent, at SPC, while DBS Esso card customers can save up to 23 per cent at Esso stations.</p><p> The POSB Everyday Card also gives 3 per cent cash rebates when card holders charge their EVs with SP Group. </p><p> OCBC 365 card members get 6 per cent cashback on fuel spend at all petrol service stations, and up to 23 per cent off fuel at Caltex, Esso and Sinopec. </p><p> The card also offers 3 per cent cashback at all EV-charging stations in Singapore. The bank saw a 400 per cent increase in EV-related transactions from 2022 to 2023 across OCBC 365 card holders, said Ms Chan Sow Han, OCBC Bank's head of group lifestyle financing. </p><p> The three local banks have in the past two years mapped out decarbonisation targets in carbon-intensive sectors they finance, as they strive to meet their net-zero commitments. </p><p> A Monetary Authority of Singapore spokesperson said: \"Our supervisory focus in relation to environmental risk is for banks to have a sound transition planning process, to build climate resilience and to facilitate robust climate mitigation and adaptation measures by their customers.\" </p><p> The authority added that it expects banks' business strategies to be consistent with internal risk appetite and publicly communicated climate-related plans and commitments. </p><p> NUS Business School professor Lawrence Loh said incentivising customer expenditure on fossil fuel products such as petrol needs to be \"fundamentally relooked\", as the practice does not square with banks' broader plans to decarbonise their portfolios.</p><p> Cars with internal combustion engines (ICEs), running mainly on petrol and diesel, release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. </p><p> Prof Loh, who is director of the school's Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said the issue needs to be addressed together with oil companies. </p><p> \"But I think banks can actually make the first move. If one bank does not get into the picture (of offering petrol discounts), another bank will, so I think, collectively, some banks will have to set the standard.\" </p><p> An ExxonMobil spokesperson noted that Esso has introduced Esso Renewable Diesel R20, made with at least 20 per cent renewable content, at four retail service stations in Singapore. The fuel has an estimated 15.4 per cent lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional diesel.</p><p> There are also EV-charging points operated by CDG Engie at Esso Pioneer, Esso East Coast and Esso Upper Aljunied. </p><p> A Chevron spokesperson noted that customers can access a voluntary carbon offset programme via the CaltexGO app.</p><p> Instead of earning reward points, customers can use the points from their fuel purchase to offset a portion of certain carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from the combustion of the fuel purchased.</p><p> Ms Tessa Er, Maybank Singapore's head of cards and personal loans, said petrol spend among card holders has grown year on year but risen at a slower pace in recent years, likely due to a shift towards EVs.</p><p> Maybank started offering petrol discounts in 2010. Its flagship Maybank Family &amp; Friends card currently offers 8 per cent cashback on petrol and transport globally. </p><p> Ms Er said demand for pooled car services and EV usage rose by more than 10 times in 2023, compared with before the pandemic. \"In Singapore, we have EV-charging promotions in the pipeline to be rolled out this year.\" </p><p> Mr Sanjay Nambiar, head of international cards and unsecured lending at Citi Global Wealth, said the bank has seen muted growth in fuel spend since the Covid-19 pandemic, amid hybrid work arrangements and greater popularity of EVs.</p><p> Citi card benefits on fuel at Shell and Esso have been in place for over a decade and are available to all of the bank's credit cards. On top of the fuel discounts, the Citi Cashback card gives an additional 8 per cent cashback on petrol spend worldwide.  </p><p> Besides cards, banks have in recent years taken other steps to encourage the use of EVs, including loans that offer lower interest rates for EVs compared with petrol and diesel cars. In April, OCBC expanded the range of EVs that can be financed under its Eco-Care car loan scheme to include used EVs of up to 10 years old. </p><p> DBS also collaborates with automotive partners on EV discovery sessions that include longer distance test drives and address common concerns such as range anxiety about EV charging.</p><p> But Singapore still has some way to go in its adoption of EVs. </p><p> SMU's Prof Liang said existing petrol-related financial products may still have a market for a while due to the legacy vehicle fleet and customer preferences.</p><p> NUS' Prof Loh said banks can only do so much through credit card rewards, and there are other factors like a lack of charging infrastructure and range anxiety that deter motorists from switching to EVs. </p><p>Singapore aims to have 60,000 EV-charging points by 2030. As at the end of December 2023, there were nearly 6,000 charging points in public and private spaces islandwide. </p><p> Costs are another big consideration for motorists, even as the authorities have introduced incentives and rebates to narrow the upfront cost gap with ICE cars.</p><p> Army regular Tristen Kian, 28, bought a second-hand hybrid car with a couple of years left on its certificate of entitlement in 2023.

The full transcript of the statement is appended.<br/><br/>NATIONAL STATEMENT BY SPECIAL ENVOY OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AND SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMANAT THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES,<br/><br/>ANTIGUA &amp; BARBUDA,<br/><br/>27 MAY 2024<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr President.<br/><br/>Excellencies<br/><br/>Distinguished Guests<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen<br/><br/>1. First, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the people of Papua New Guinea for the tragic loss of lives and injuries arising from the deadly landslide.<br/><br/>2. Ten years ago, we adopted the SAMOA Pathway, a programme of action for SIDS to address multifaceted challenges. I am glad to see that SIDS have since made strides in their development. The 2022 UN Secretary-General's Report on the Follow-up to and Implementation of the SAMOA Pathway showed that most SIDS are progressing in sustainable energy, food security and nutrition, gender equality and women's empowerment, as well as water and sanitation.<br/><br/>3. But our work is far from over. Over the last decade, new issues have arisen and the past few years have been particularly challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic, sharpening geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, climate change, and food and energy insecurity have been major threats. New issues such as technology and AI have also emerged, which present both opportunities and challenges. As the SAMOA Pathway draws to a close, we need to refresh our approach and strengthen our partnerships to deal with this new environment and accelerate progress towards the SDGs.<br/><br/>4. We therefore strongly welcome the adoption of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS, our programme of action for the next decade. This action-oriented document highlights emerging issues that we must collectively address, and which also require strong support from the international community for SIDS. Let me share Singapore's views on two emerging challenges for SIDS.<br/><br/>5. First, climate change. SIDS are on the frontline of feeling the impacts of climate change. We are increasingly affected by tropical cyclones, storm surges, droughts, and changing precipitation patterns, as documented by the IPCC and which we have all experienced acutely. Last year was the warmest year globally. The IPCC's forecast of global mean sea-level rise of up to 1.1 metres by 2100 would be a disaster for many of us. Adaptation is clearly an urgent priority for SIDS. Singapore therefore fully supports the ABAS' call for timely support for action on adaptation, including the operationalisation and implementation of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience. In addition, SIDS must work together to push for a successful COP-29 in Azerbaijan which ensures all countries fulfil their climate pledges to keep the Paris Agreement temperature goal of 1.5C within reach.<br/><br/>6. Second, digitalisation. Singapore agrees with the ABAS' recommendation to harness digital technologies to achieve sustainable development. The ITU has reported that internet use in SIDS since 2014 has grown faster than global growth, at an annual growth rate of 8.4 percent. This is encouraging as connectivity is the enabler for digital transformation, which could yield economic benefits. For example, the UNDP projected that the adoption of financial digital public infrastructure can contribute to 20 to 33 percent of economic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Singapore's experience in adopting mobile banking and digital payment systems such as the Singapore QR code - the world's first unified national e-payment system - has been a positive one as it allowed us to scale up e-payments and create innovative business opportunities.<br/><br/>7. In the spirit of South-South cooperation, Singapore is contributing our digital solutions for healthcare, electronic verification, and accessibility to the UNDP's and ITU's open registries of digital public goods. To reap the full benefits of digitalisation, SIDS should also create an enabling environment to foster innovation, while promoting digital inclusion to ensure that no one is left behind in this digital revolution. To this end, Singapore and the UNDP have been working on a joint challenge where innovative solutions from SIDS on managing coastal risk and transport infrastructure can be showcased and applied.<br/><br/>Mr President,<br/><br/>8. No SIDS can tackle these challenges alone. As a tiny island-state, Singapore understands the unique challenges faced by SIDS. We have benefitted much in learning from other countries during our development journey and are happy to share our experiences. We echo the call in the ABAS to strengthen partnerships for human resource development as this is also reflected in Singapore's belief that a country's most valuable asset is its human capital. Singapore has been offering technical assistance packages for SIDS since 1999, in response to the evolving challenges. For example, the Singapore Partnership for the SAMOA Pathway, which we launched in 2019, offered tailor-made programmes including on climate change and disaster risk reduction. I am glad that more than 2,200 officials have participated in this programme. As we prepare for the challenges of the coming decade, I am pleased to announce Singapore's new technical assistance package for SIDS, which we call \"SIDS of Change\". This package includes new customised programmes on emerging issues such as blue carbon and digitalisation. We will also continue to sponsor civil aviation and maritime fellowships for SIDS officials to build up capabilities in these important areas that will enhance our connectivity. We invite all SIDS to participate actively in these programmes.<br/><br/>9.

Mr Speaker, heat resilience is an important issue for Singapore. Rising temperatures will be compounded by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, as our densely built-up environment absorbs and retains heat, and activities such as transportation and industrial works generate heat.<br/><br/>2. Various Members had previously filed questions on heat resilience, including just yesterday. We would like to assure this House that the Government has for some time now and will continue to address this as part of our overall climate resilience efforts.<br/><br/>3. The Government adopts a science-based and proactive heat resilience strategy, which has three prongs: (i) First, implementing national-level cooling strategies to benefit all segments of our society, including the vulnerable; (ii) second, strengthening the community's resilience, especially among more vulnerable population segments; and (iii) third, deepening our scientific understanding of the impact of rising temperatures.<br/><br/>Implementing national-level cooling strategies to benefit all segments of our society<br/><br/>4. First, cooling strategies aim to keep us cool in our warm climate.<br/><br/>5. Greening Singapore is a key strategy that has multiple benefits, including providing shade and reducing ambient temperatures of our surroundings. As we transform Singapore into a City in Nature, we are setting in place a network of green spaces across the island so that by 2030, every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park. We are also intensifying greenery beyond just our parks. This includes planting trees along roads. Under the OneMillionTrees Movement, with the help of our partners and the community, we have planted over 630,000 trees. Other greening measures include increasing skyrise greenery and greenery on building facades, such as through URA's Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) scheme. As part of greenery intensification efforts under the Green Towns Programme, suitable top decks of HDB multi-storey car parks are converted to greenery and community or allotment gardens.<br/><br/>6. We are also deploying other cooling strategies across the island. The Member may be aware from MND's PQ response yesterday that HDB conducts environmental modelling for new towns and estates. This enables us to site new flats and orientate blocks to optimise wind flow and reduce heat gain. For existing towns, under HDB's Green Towns Programme, we are studying the application of cool coatings.<br/><br/>7. Besides these broad-based measures, there are also specific measures to help various vulnerable groups cope with the impact of higher temperatures. For instance, HDB has created more openings along corridors in some older rental blocks by removing some units from each floor. This enhances airflow and natural ventilation in these blocks. Migrant worker dormitories are required to be provided with adequate fans to ensure good air circulation and ventilation in the dormitory rooms and Recreation Centres. MOM is also installing ice machines in Recreation Centres.<br/><br/>Strengthening the community's resilience to heat<br/><br/>8. Second, we have taken steps to empower the community to cope with a warming world.<br/><br/>9. We launched the Heat Stress Advisory in July last year, to guide the public on ways to minimise the risk of heat stress. The public can easily check the prevailing heat stress levels on the myENV app before embarking on outdoor activities, and take simple steps to protect ourselves. This is no different from checking the weather forecast for rain, in deciding whether to bring an umbrella. Similar to the other weather data on the myENV app, readings are based on the monitoring station nearest to the app user automatically.<br/><br/>10. We currently have 9 WBGT stations islandwide, and will be expanding our network.<br/><br/>11. Access to water is important to address heat stress. We have easy access to clean drinking water. Singapore's tap water is perfectly safe for direct consumption, without the need for boiling or water filters.<br/><br/>12. Furthermore, water dispensers are widely available at hawker centres, parks, bus interchanges and terminals. SUSS undergraduate Tng Ming Kang has created a crowd-sourced map on these existing water dispensers in Singapore.<br/><br/>13. We also have targeted sector-specific guidelines for various groups including outdoor workers, athletes, uniformed personnel, residential homes and schools. Let me elaborate.<br/><br/>14. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) introduced an enhanced set of measures to reduce the risk of heat stress for outdoor workers last year. These include measures focusing on four aspects: acclimatise, drink, rest, and shade. Of note, employers are required to provide a minimum rest break of 10 minutes hourly under shade for workers carrying out heavy physical activities when the WBGT (degree celsius) is 32 or higher. Employers should also reschedule outdoor work to cooler parts of the day where feasible and re-deploy workers vulnerable to heat stress.<br/><br/>15. Beyond MOM's guidelines, we are also heartened that organisations have taken additional steps to protect outdoor workers. For instance, Changi Airport Group provides refresh pods at staff rest areas which circulate cool air at the touch of a button. They also deploy trucks with isotonic drinks to remind workers to stay hydrated. For our delivery workers, Grab and Foodpanda remind riders on heat stress. Deliveroo provides water for riders at its delivery-only kitchens and encourages merchants do so too.<br/><br/>Deepening our scientific understanding of the impact of rising temperatures<br/><br/>16. Finally, on deepening our scientific understanding. Our heat-resilience strategies are based on science. For instance, we set the Heat Stress Advisory thresholds in consultation with experts, and we are reviewing our heat resilience plans based on the climate projections from our Third National Climate Change study.<br/><br/>17. We leverage R&amp;D to design more effective heat resilience strategies. For example, the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project is developing a digital model, to simulate Singapore's urban climate and assess the effectiveness of various cooling strategies. Researchers in NUS are also investigating the impact of warmer and more humid nights on sleep quality, to develop novel cooling solutions such as smart systems that can adjust fan wind speed and air-con temperature. This will ensure that rising temperatures do not take a toll on people's rest while we remain energy efficient.<br/><br/>18. The Cooling Singapore 2.0 project also investigates the impact of heat on different segments of the population, such as the elderly and children. We may also consider studying other relevant social-economic dimensions in the future. Through the Climate Impact Science Research (CISR) Programme, we will examine the effects of rising temperatures on our physical and mental health, as well as second-order effects such as increased mosquito population.<br/><br/>19. We also cooperate with international partners on future collaborations and knowledge-sharing. The Heat Resilience and Performance Centre (HRPC) at NUS will be the Southeast Asia node of the Global Heat Health Information Network, an initiative by the World Health Organisation and World Meteorological Organisation.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>20. Even as the government takes steps to address warming temperatures and UHI, I would like to call on the public to join us on this journey to make Singapore and our communities more heat-resilient.<br/><br/>21. Individually, we can take steps to reduce heat emissions by taking public transport, and using less air-conditioning and more energy-efficient electrical appliances. As a community, we can look out more for one another and co-create solutions such as setting up community cool spaces, to beat the heat together.</p><p>[Category: Construction &amp; Materials, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Heat resilience is an important issue for Singapore.

At the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE)'s Committee of Supply debate on 4 March 2024, Minister Ms Grace Fu, Senior Ministers of State Dr Amy Khor and Dr Koh Poh Koon, and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Baey Yam Keng shared the Ministry's key initiatives in creating a clean, green, and resilient shared Singapore.<br/><br/>2. This year, we are focusing our efforts on enhancing public hygiene to better protect public health and create a thriving urban environment for Singaporeans. We have inherited a clean and green environment from earlier generations, but it is up to us to leave an even better environment for our future generations. In the spirit of the Forward Singapore exercise, we are designating 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene to inspire collective responsibility and to galvanise a whole-of-nation effort to upkeep our hygiene standards across four key areas: clean environment, safe food, clean air, and clean water.<br/><br/>3. We will also continue to work with our stakeholders to press on towards net zero and strengthen our climate resilience. We will expand the Government's green procurement policies and strengthen our support for businesses and households to become more resource- and energy-efficient. We are also enhancing coastal protection measures and strengthening efforts to secure a supply of safe food.<br/><br/>Year of Public Hygiene<br/><br/>Clean Environment<br/><br/>4. While most members of the public are socially responsible, a small number of people continue to litter, particularly at certain hotspots. To tackle this issue, NEA will step up enforcement at cleanliness hotspots, employ greater use of technology and rally the community to help keep Singapore clean. This includes increasing the frequency and scale of anti-littering enforcement blitzes, and a four-fold increase in the deployment of CCTVs at hotspots (See Annex A(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20A%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20NEA's%20stepped%20up%20efforts%20in%20the%20Year%20of%20Public%20Hygiene.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20A%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20NEA's%20stepped%20up%20efforts%20in%20the%20Year%20of%20Public%20Hygiene.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>5. Improving the cleanliness of public toilets is another area that we will focus on, in partnership with our stakeholders. MSE will form a Public Toilets Taskforce, which will study and recommend solutions to improve the cleanliness of public toilets, particularly those at coffeshops and hawker centres. The Taskforce will be co-chaired by Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Baey Yam Keng and Chairman of the Public Hygiene Council, Mr Andrew Khng. It will comprise representatives from across public sector agencies, town councils, trade associations, non-governmental organisations, academia, professionals, premises managers and industry associations. Details will be announced in due course (See Annex A(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20A%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20NEA's%20stepped%20up%20efforts%20in%20the%20Year%20of%20Public%20Hygiene.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20A%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20NEA's%20stepped%20up%20efforts%20in%20the%20Year%20of%20Public%20Hygiene.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>Safe Food<br/><br/>6. Ensuring food safety is a joint responsibility shared by all parties along the food supply chain. Even as the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) puts in place a regulatory system and enabling environment to ensure food safety, the food industry must also play an active role in maintaining good food safety standards.<br/><br/>7. SFA is refining the grading system for assessing the food safety performance of food establishments. The current grading system, which provides a snapshot of food safety performance at the point of inspection, may not adequately reflect whether food safety standards have been consistently maintained by the food establishments. This refined grading system, the Safety Assurance for Food Establishments (SAFE) framework, will provide consumers with a better representation of food establishments' food safety performance by taking into account the establishments' track record and food safety management systems. Further details will be announced later this year.<br/><br/>Clean Air<br/><br/>8. Formaldehyde is currently added to some paints as a preservative to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. Exposure to formaldehyde can be harmful to our health. We will introduce limits on formaldehyde in building products in a phased approach, starting with interior paints. From 1 January 2026, NEA will require paints sold in Singapore intended for application on interior surfaces of buildings not to contain formaldehyde (See Annex B(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20B%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Limits%20on%20formaldehyde%20in%20interior%20paints.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20B%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Limits%20on%20formaldehyde%20in%20interior%20paints.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>Clean Water<br/><br/>9. Safeguarding our precious water resources to ensure a supply of clean water for Singaporeans is of utmost importance. In this regard, PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, will look to introduce measures to better protect our waterways, reservoirs and sewerage system. The measures would further deter silt discharges into our waterways and reservoirs, and illegal discharge of harmful substances into our public sewerage system. More details will be released later this year.<br/><br/>Rallying Businesses and Individuals to Action<br/><br/>10. Sustaining high levels of public hygiene requires all of us to play a part. The Year of Public Hygiene goes beyond just doubling down on our enforcement efforts. We will also rally businesses, community and individuals to play an active part to upkeep good public hygiene practices for our collective well-being.<br/><br/>11. The Public Hygiene Council (PHC) will launch the latest edition of the annual Keep Singapore Clean campaign on 28 April this year to galvanise Singaporeans to do their part to uphold higher standards of hygiene and cleanliness. This year's campaign will rally PHC's business, government and community partners to reaffirm their collective commitment to keep Singapore clean.<br/><br/>12. Building on last year's inaugural campaign, MSE will roll out the second edition of Go Green SG across June and July this year with an expanded range of exclusive activities, including on public hygiene. This will allow more participants and partners across the People, Public and Private sectors to join us in taking care of our environment.<br/><br/>Pressing On Towards Net Zero<br/><br/>Green Government<br/><br/>13. In 2022, we raised our national ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We will enhance the public sector's green procurement policies to support this goal.<br/><br/>14. Last year, we announced that the Government will set aside up to 5 per cent of evaluation points for environmental sustainability for large government construction and ICT tenders starting from FY2024. We will extend this green public procurement initiative to government tenders for Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions (MICE) and other events organised by the public sector from FY2025. Further industry consultations will be conducted before finalising details.<br/><br/>Supporting Households and Businesses in Improving Resource- and Energy Efficiency<br/><br/>15. Through the existing Climate Friendly Households Programme, 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB households were given vouchers to be used between November 2020 and 20 March 2024 for the purchase of energy-efficient refrigerators, LED lights and water-efficient shower fittings. This helps to reduce energy and water consumption, lower utility bills, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br/><br/>16. To encourage wider adoption of more energy efficient products in households, NEA and PUB will enhance the Climate Friendly Households Programme. From 15 April 2024, all HDB households can look forward to receiving $300 worth of Climate Vouchers, which can be used to purchase ten types of energy- and water-efficient household products at participating retailers (See Annex C(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20C%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Enhanced%20Climate%20Friendly%20Households%20Programme.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20C%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Enhanced%20Climate%20Friendly%20Households%20Programme.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>17. NEA's Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) and the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) has helped consumers and businesses make informed decisions to purchase more energy efficient appliances. From 1 April 2025, we will expand the schemes to include household water heaters and commercial storage refrigerators (See Annex D(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20D%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20MELS%20MEPS%20for%20commercial%20storage%20refrigerators%20and%20household%20water%20heaters.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20D%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20MELS%20MEPS%20for%20commercial%20storage%20refrigerators%20and%20household%20water%20heaters.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>18. We are also helping businesses shift towards more circular and zero waste business models. NEA has worked with training providers and the waste management industry association to introduce a Zero Waste Manager course to train personnel to lead and champion waste management and reduction efforts in their organisations (See Annex E(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20E%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Zero%20Waste%20Manager%20Course.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20E%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Zero%20Waste%20Manager%20Course.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>Strengthening our Climate Resilience<br/><br/>Enhancing Coastal Protection<br/><br/>19. Sea levels are projected to rise by up to 1.15m by 2100 under the high emission scenario. We must protect Singapore from rising sea levels by ensuring that coastal protection measures are implemented effectively.<br/><br/>20. PUB will propose new coastal protection legislation to delineate the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, and safeguard land for coastal protection measures and future upgrades to cater for uncertainties in climate projections. It will also regulate and enforce against activities that could pose a risk to coastal protection measures and ensure that PUB's coastal protection standards are met. We intend to kickstart consultations on this new legislation this year (See Annex F(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20F%20-%20Media%20Factsheet%20on%20Coastal%20Protection%20Legislation%20and%20Code%20of%20Practice.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20F%20-%20Media%20Factsheet%20on%20Coastal%20Protection%20Legislation%20and%20Code%20of%20Practice.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>21. PUB also commenced a two-year study in November 2023, to develop a new Code of Practice to guide and standardise the design, implementation, as well as operation and maintenance of coastal protection measures.<br/><br/>Securing a Supply of Safe Food<br/><br/>22. We are working to transform our aquaculture sector, given its potential to contribute to Singapore's '30 by 30' vision. Along with other Government agencies, SFA is updating the Singapore Aquaculture Plan (SAP) in collaboration with key stakeholders, including industry, academics, nature groups by deep diving into ways to transform the aquaculture sector to be more productive and sustainable. The multi-stakeholder group is midway into its discussions and will consolidate its recommendations in an updated version of the SAP, to serve as a roadmap as we navigate the way forward for the sector (See Annex G(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20G%20-%20Media%20Factsheet%20on%20Singapore%20Aquaculture%20Plan.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20G%20-%20Media%20Factsheet%20on%20Singapore%20Aquaculture%20Plan.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>23. We will introduce a Food Safety and Security Bill to strengthen our food safety and security regime to better protect consumers, and safeguard Singapore's food supply resilience.

I thank the UAE Government, the City of Dubai, and the UNFCCC Secretariat for organising COP28 this year. I also thank the UAE COP Presidency for your leadership in advancing discussions and placing the focus of COP28 on facilitating a just and inclusive transition.</p><p>Amid heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty, the latest UNFCCC Synthesis Report has laid bare how far we are from achieving the Paris Agreement's goals. The world is on a pathway to 2.1-2.8C of global warming by 2100. The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events today - from droughts in Africa and the USA, to heat waves in Asia and Europe - are clear warning signs for us to take decisive action and secure our collective future.</p><p>The first Global Stocktake presents a timely opportunity for the world to course-correct to keep the target of 1.5C within reach. This can only be achieved if we deliver substantive, inclusive, and balanced outcomes at COP28 across mitigation, adaptation as well as means of implementation. At this critical juncture, we need to foster even stronger multilateral cooperation than before. Today, Singapore reaffirms its commitment to domestic climate action, regional partnerships and global collaboration.</p><p>Domestic climate action</p><p>First, Singapore is committed to doing its part by delivering progress on domestic climate action.</p><p>Last year, Singapore raised our climate ambition. We submitted our enhanced Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) with a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and our updated 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce our emissions to 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, after peaking our emissions earlier.</p><p>Since then, Singapore has been focusing our efforts on implementation and delivering progress. Our climate targets are backed by concrete policies and plans.</p><p>Singapore's carbon tax covers around 80% of our national greenhouse gas emissions and has one of the highest coverages in the world. We will raise our carbon tax level five-fold to 25 Singapore dollars, or around 19 US dollars, per tonne of emissions in 2024 and progressively to 50-80 Singapore dollars, or 37-60 US dollars, by 2030, making it one of the highest in Asia. This will send a strong price signal and drive emitters to decarbonise, while giving companies greater price certainty for forward planning.</p><p>We have mandated zero vehicle population growth since 2018 and have put in place policy levers to support our vision for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. Our 2040 target is for public, active and shared transport modes to account for 9 in 10 of all peak-period journeys.</p><p>We are developing a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply ecosystem for Singapore. Neste, a Finnish energy company, recently completed its US$1.76 billion expansion to increase SAF production capacity to up to 1 million tonnes per annum, making Singapore home to the largest SAF production site in the world. Following a 20-month pilot completed in November 2023 which found Singapore to be operationally ready to supply SAF, we are developing a structural offtake mechanism to support SAF adoption in Singapore.</p><p>We have put in place stronger emission standards for the power sector. From 2024, we will require all new and repowered natural gas power plants to be 10% more efficient and at least 30% hydrogen-compatible by volume.</p><p>Singapore is alternative energy disadvantaged and faces an uphill challenge given the lack of domestic mitigation options. Nevertheless, we have invested in holistic and innovative solutions to overcome our constraints.</p><p>Although we have limited to no potential for hydroelectric, tidal, wind and geothermal power, we have spared no effort in harnessing solar power. We are already halfway towards achieving our target of 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.</p><p>Given our small physical size and high population density, we have made innovative use of our limited land. We have deployed large-scale floating solar farms, which leverage the surface area of our reservoirs to scale up solar deployment. In 2024, Southeast Asia (SEA)'s first floating and stacked Energy Storage System, Seatrium's Floating Living Lab, will also start operations in Singapore.</p><p>Regional partnerships</p><p>Second, Singapore is committed to working with other Parties to deliver on our pledges through regional partnerships. Through such collaboration, we aim to unlock decarbonisation potential across national boundaries more quickly and effectively for all Parties, to accelerate Asia's low-carbon transition.</p><p>One key enabler is the channelling of finance to catalyse our region's transition. It is estimated that Asia will need US$1.7 trillion in climate and infrastructure investments per annum through 2030. This is a substantial amount - it will be necessary to crowd in both concessional and commercial capital. At COP28, Singapore will announce Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships (FAST-P), a new blended finance initiative that aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion in finance. FAST-P will bring together public and private sector partners to de-risk and finance transition and marginally-bankable green projects in Asia. Through FAST-P, we hope that climate action will be realised as an opportunity for collective regional growth.</p><p>Another key enabler is the promotion of win-win partnerships to fast track our region's energy transition. As cross-border clean energy trade develops, Singapore has announced plans to import around 4GW of low-carbon electricity from Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam by 2035. This lead demand forms the buildings blocks of our joint vision of an ASEAN Power Grid, which will strengthen energy resilience and decarbonise power generation across Southeast Asia.</p><p>Beyond mitigation, regional partnerships are essential to strengthening our collective climate resilience. An important first step is to advance our common understanding of climate science and the regional impacts of climate change.</p><p>To support mutual learning, Singapore will share the findings from our Third National Climate Change Study (V3), the world's first high-resolution regional climate projections based on the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), with regional partners through the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) and the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment for the Southeast Asia Region. We will also work with partners to conduct more robust assessments of climate impacts in specific areas such as food, water and livability.</p><p>Singapore also actively participates in partnerships to advance adaptation priority areas such as food, water, and heat resilience, as well as coastal and flood protection.</p><p>By incorporating V3's regional climate projections into the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's climate risk assessment tools, regional partners can conduct climate change impact assessments on their agrifood systems.</p><p>These efforts complement our other capacity building programmes for water management and governance, such as the Temasek Foundation Water Leadership Programme. Similarly, for heat resilience, the National University of Singapore will host the Global Heat Health Information Network's Southeast Asia Regional Heat Health Node, to build regional capabilities in addressing extreme heat risks.</p><p>For coastal protection and flood management, Singapore has launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI). CFI Singapore forges strong connections with industry partners and international experts, to enhance capabilities and expertise in coastal and flood protection. Singapore will also continue to share our perspectives and knowledge through platforms such as the Singapore International Water Week and the International Panel on Deltas and Coastal Areas.</p><p>In line with the UN Early Warnings for All Initiative, which Singapore supported at COP27, we conduct regional capability building activities to strengthen our collective climate resilience. This includes training workshops under the ASMC Capability Building Programme in areas such as regional climate projections, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, as well as fire hotspot and haze assessments.</p><p>Global collaboration</p><p>Third, global collaboration is essential to ensure a just and inclusive transition. To accelerate implementation without leaving anyone behind, we must promote knowledge sharing and mutual learning among countries.</p><p>Singapore has been providing capacity building through our Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) and its Sustainability Action Package (SAP). Close to 150,000 officials from over 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations have participated in programmes covering topics such as climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, and green finance.</p><p>Multilateralism at platforms such as the UNFCCC continues to be key to ensuring a just and inclusive transition. Singapore is committed to helping forge global consensus, to achieve substantive, balanced and inclusive outcomes.</p><p>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu will co-facilitate the Ministerial consultations on Mitigation with Norway.</p><p>Chief Negotiator Joseph Teo will lead the Joint Contact Group for the Global Stocktake discussions as co-chairman with the UK.</p><p>As IPCC WGII's Co-Chair for the 7th Assessment Report (AR7) cycle, Associate Professor Winston Chow will help advance global assessments of climate change vulnerability and adaptation options, which will inform the second Global Stocktake in 2028. These findings will be especially valuable for fellow developing countries.</p><p>At COP28, Singapore is pleased to support the following initiatives which call for collective and inclusive climate action:</p><p>We have co-sponsored the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge.

The UK updated on the progress of the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT)'s disclosure framework following its publication in October 2023, and outlined plans for introducing expectations for listed companies' transition plan disclosures. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) shared its consultation on Transition Planning Guidelines in 2023, which set out supervisory expectations for financial institutions to have a sound transition planning process, as they build climate resilience and manage risks arising from the global transition to a net zero economy and the expected physical effects of global warming. The UK and Singapore also noted the importance of ongoing work at G20, Financial Stability Board (FSB), Basel Committee's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks (TFCR), International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in this respect.<br/><br/>b. Disclosure standards, ESG ratings and data products: The UK and Singapore re-affirmed their commitment to implement the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)'s standards to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of sustainability-related disclosures globally. The UK provided an update on its Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and its associated labelling regime. The UK and Singapore also discussed the voluntary codes of conduct for ESG ratings and data product providers that have been published in their respective countries, noting that both codes were aligned with IOSCO's recommendations. Both countries agreed to consider collaboration opportunities as the regulatory landscape evolves, including through IOSCO's Sustainable Finance Taskforce.<br/><br/>c. Sustainable infrastructure and investment: The UK and Singapore noted the large funding gap for Asia's green and transition finance, and agreed that there are opportunities to mobilise private capital for the net zero transition. Building on the September 2023 UK-Singapore Strategic Partnership Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore - 20230909 UK-SG Strategic Partnership (mfa.gov.sg) to accelerate regional sustainable infrastructure and investment, the UK and Singapore will collaborate to develop and finance green finance and energy transition projects in the region.

Expo 2020, ongoing in Dubai, focuses on creating sustainable links between food, agriculture, and livelihoods. And building on the outcomes of COP26, the upcoming Middle East and North America Climate Week will help regional stakeholders identify actionable climate change opportunities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These are much-needed initiatives when over 690 million people go to bed hungry, and over 270 million people are experiencing acute food shortages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How climate risk plays out on a local level</p><p> In the context of palm oil's climate impact, deforestation, draining of peat swamps, land clearance by burning, and biodiversity loss due to oil palm cultivation all pose significant environmental challenges. But the most immediate effects are felt at the local level with the destruction of ecosystems.</p><p> The September 2015 Indonesian forest fires, for example, destroyed 2.6 million ha of forest and emitted greenhouse gases (GHG) equal to Germany's annual emission volumes. It put the health of millions at risk and cost Indonesia US$16.1 billion - twice the cost of reconstruction following the 2004 tsunami.</p><p> The human population is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050. To meet global vegetable oil demand, land for oil palm cultivation will predictably double - from 14.6 million ha in 2019 to 31.1 million ha by 2050.</p><p> However, the current suitable oil palm climatic zones will shrink 22 per cent by 2050. This could lead to the migration of oil palm cultivation to replacement lands, triggering deforestation and biodiversity loss in newer ecosystems. Unsustainable land conversion of this scale will further deepen the climate crisis.</p><p> These predictions provide a stern warning for the industry - decarbonise now.</p><p>Discerning fact from opinion</p><p> Palm oil is among the world's most versatile raw materials - it is semi solid at room temperature and stable for long periods without going rancid. Its functional properties make it a key ingredient in everyday products - from bread and infant milk formula to toothpaste, washing-up detergent, and even cough syrup. It is almost impossible to avoid palm oil.</p><p> It is also the most efficient vegetable oil crop on the market. It meets 40 per cent of the global demand yet only occupies 6 per cent of the land used to produce vegetable oils. This makes it especially beneficial for the millions of smallholders who rely on palm oil for a steady income.</p><p> Replacement oils need between 4 and 10 times more land to produce the same yield, which only displaces and exacerbates deforestation and habitat loss.</p><p> Avoiding or replacing palm oil is not a viable solution; establishing sustainable life cycles is.</p><p>Why certified sustainable palm oil makes sense</p><p> Comprehensive and inclusive certification schemes, such as The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), mitigate environmental and social issues and ensure that demand is met sustainably. Several studies have sought to quantify the environmental impacts of palm oil certified by the RSPO.</p><p> A LifeCycle Assessment finds that RSPO certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) emits 35 per cent less GHG emissions and is associated with a 20 per cent lower impact on biodiversity compared to non-certified palm oil.</p><p>Malaysia's and Indonesia's GHG emissions from oil palm-driven land conversion alone have reached a staggering 1.4 per cent of the global aggregate, bringing it on a par with global emissions from the aviation industry. Given this reality, integrating climate resilience across palm oil supply chains is key to achieving net-zero status by 2050.</p><p> Arresting deforestation is the first step in this direction. With the industry projected to reach US$57.2 billion by 2026 - in tandem with population growth, growing affluence and bioenergy expansion - we need to find sustainable ways to meet this increasing demand.</p><p> CSPO improves the efficiency of palm oil production, reducing the need for land conversion and the risk of deforestation.</p><p> The second step is the reduction of GHG emissions. Peatlands are among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth, storing more carbon than all other vegetation types combined. This makes draining them for oil palm cultivation especially problematic. Annually, damaged peatlands release 5 per cent of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p> Peatland conservation is therefore vital to our decarbonisation goal. The RSPO supports such conservation with criteria of no new planting on peat and no deforestation areas, a critical part in limiting the carbon footprint of palm oil. As my colleague and head of climate change unit at RSPO, Amir Afham, pointed out: \"Given the vital role that tropical forests and peatlands play in regulating global climate, we must continue to strengthen our standards and enforcement mechanisms, and push for sustainability over a boycott of palm oil\".</p><p> The third measure is the empowerment of local communities, improving the lives and livelihoods of millions. Malaysia is an ideal case, where palm oil has been a key contributor to reducing poverty from 50 per cent in the 1960s to just 5 per cent today; and where 40 per cent of oil palm growers are smallholder farmers.</p><p> To bring more independent smallholders into the sustainable supply chain, RSPO has sought to tailor compliance mechanisms and financial assistance to their needs. The RSPO Independent Smallholder Standard simplifies the approach to certification while the RSPO Smallholder Support Fund helps to offset the cost of audits. Together, these are essential in enabling smallholders to access international markets and command a premium for their produce.</p><p>Improving our toolkit</p><p> Palm oil supply chains are complex. While RSPO certification is not perfect, it is one of the most effective tools we have to achieve positive environmental and social change at scale.</p><p> RSPO continually improves its guidance on best practices and is committed to strengthening the assurance system's transparency and integrity. GeoRSPO, the RSPO Hotspot Hub, and building the capacity of auditors to better assess compliance with our standards are among the recent enhancements.</p><p> As we can see, palm oil per se is not the problem. If cultivated sustainably, palm oil can help combat the world's climate and biodiversity crises, and drive socio-economic development in rural communities.</p><p>Change requires collective action</p><p> A total of 93 per cent of the world's top palm oil companies have not publicly assessed climate risk, and 78 per cent of companies are yet to make public targets to reduce GHG emissions.</p><p> Life cycle assessments need more transparency. Just 16 per cent of producers report on how they are monitoring their zero-deforestation commitments, only 27 per cent report their total peatland cultivation areas, and an even fewer (15 per cent) report GHG emissions from land-use change.</p><p> Another big obstacle to progress is a lack of consumer awareness. Although RSPO certified products assure deforestation-free palm oil, the market takes up just over 50 per cent of what is grown to RSPO standards. Increasing the market share of CSPO is therefore a fundamental goal for both producers and consumers.</p><p> To deliver on climate action and shared responsibility goals, we need to garner stronger support from all stakeholders - growers, investors, governments, advocacy groups, and consumers.</p><p>The writer is global head of stakeholder engagement at The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Malaysia's and Indonesia's GHG emissions from oil palm-driven land conversion alone have reached a staggering 1. 4 per cent of the global aggregate, bringing it on a par with global emissions from the aviation industry.

I am heartened to see the level of interest in this topic from across the globe and from different parts of the financial ecosystem.</p><p>The effects of climate change are clear and present. Record-breaking heatwaves, wildfires and floods are occurring with increasing frequency globally.</p><p>* There is great urgency to fulfil our collective net zero commitments.</p><p>* Linear trend extrapolation puts us at going beyond 1.5 degrees come September 2034 . That is just over a decade away, not very far away at all.</p><p>This trend, if not arrested, has significant financial implications for both companies and individuals.</p><p>* Business models that are unable to adapt to rising temperatures or meet the needs of the real economy as it seeks to transition towards net zero may become uncompetitive, or worse, unsustainable over the long term.</p><p>* Banks with exposures to real estate in low lying regions are exposed to greater flood risk as temperatures rise. This can increase losses.</p><p>* This impact to banks could be mitigated through insurance but such risks may become uninsurable.</p><p>* Since the beginning of the year, insurers representing more than half of California's US$12 billion home insurance market have either stopped or placed restrictions on issuing new policies. Regulations have prevented premium rates from rising to keep pace with ballooning costs, including those associated with the increased risks of wildfires and floods.

It can also increase operational challenges, through business or supply chain interruptions brought about by more extreme weather patterns.</p><p>Second, on means to support an orderly transition.</p><p>* FIs are in a unique position of trust to engage their customers to shape corporate decisions.</p><p>- As lenders and underwriters, banks and insurers can raise customers' climate risk awareness and work with them to implement robust risk mitigation and adaptation measures as part of their due diligence and underwriting processes.</p><p>- As investors, FIs can also shape corporate behavior and climate responsiveness through engagement, proxy voting and sector collaboration.</p><p>The time to act is now.</p><p>* We cannot afford to wait till all the data is clean and the methodologies are mature. Catalysing change in the real economy takes time.</p><p>* FIs must act in unison, across jurisdictions, to avoid the perverse situation where customers seek financial solutions from FIs with lower climate ambitions, where the urgency or incentive to transition is absent. This will slow the pace of change in the real economy, thereby increasing the chances of a disorderly transition.</p><p>Encouragingly, some FIs have started to incorporate climate change considerations into their business strategies and risk management processes.</p><p>* This allows them to optimise business opportunities and build climate resilience over the longer term.</p><p>* We are defining this approach as transition planning in our proposed Guidelines.</p><p>As FIs develop and implement transition planning, supervisors can and should signpost the direction of travel and promote greater consistency in practices across FIs. Our Guidelines seek to do just this.</p><p>Amongst other things, the Guidelines clarify our expectation that transition planning must involve active customer and investee engagement on the need for them to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies, including effective measures to reduce their carbon footprint. After all, customers' elevated climate related exposures will directly and negatively impact the climate resilience of an FI's balance sheet or portfolio.</p><p>We further clarify that -</p><p>* Engagement, rather than divestment, should be the key lever through which FIs steward their customers and investee companies' orderly transition to net zero . Indiscriminate withdrawal of credit, insurance coverage, or investments from customers or investee companies deemed to be more exposed to climate risks would hinder those with credible transition and adaptation plans from securing the financial support they need to make the transition.</p><p>* We also recognise in our Guidelines that supporting transitioning customers or investee companies may result in higher interim carbon emissions . From time to time, a real gap may also arise between planned and actual emission when targets are missed. These should not deter FIs from facilitating the needed transition of the real economy. Instead, FIs should provide clear disclosures and explanations to help correct market misperceptions that they have departed from their espoused risk appetites. Fis should also share the risk management steps they are taking to remediate the real variance.</p><p>* The guidance further exhorts financial institutions to keep up with the science, collect and analyse relevant data, and build improved capabilities to measure and manage climate and other related risks.</p><p>We are communicating our supervisory expectations early through the proposed Guidelines to create clarity and urgency for FIs to allocate the appropriate resources and commence this work in earnest now.</p><p>* The Guidelines on Transition Planning are proposed for all three sectors - banks, insurers, and asset managers.</p><p>* This will allow us to rally the financial industry around a common standard while taking sector differences into account - an approach which we had adopted for our earlier Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management and which the industry has found helpful.</p><p>We look forward to receiving comments on what supervisory guidance can push FIs to be proactive, deliberate and effective in their transition planning, and we look to involve as broad a range of stakeholders as possible in the consultation process.</p><p>* We have already benefited greatly from the regulatory discussions internationally, such as the work by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the current discussion on transition planning under the Basel Committee's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks (TFCR).</p><p>* We hope to contribute to the ongoing discourse through this publication.</p><p>On this note, I wish you a very fruitful discussion subsequently, and hope that some of these ideas will be promulgated and bear fruit elsewhere, so as to bring us into a more sustainable, less risky future.</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Investment Banking &amp; Brokerage, Events]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["This will slow the pace of change in the real economy, thereby increasing the chances of a disorderly transition.

But now, the tides are telling a different story -- one of growing uncertainty and vulnerability in the face of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It is also a story of resilience in the people's struggle to adapt to climate change and survive the disasters that it brings.</p><p> Like millions of people across Bangladesh, Mr Forhad Islam, 35, relies on agriculture to feed his family. But when he took charge of the family farm more than a decade ago, he struggled to grow crops because of the intrusion of salt water. </p><p> \"Our ancestors used to say that the land was our lifeline, but at some point, I felt like it was betraying us,\" said Mr Islam with a sigh. </p><p> He lives in the village of Katianangla in south-west Bangladesh, about 100km from the sea and near the river Pasur, a distributary of the Ganges. </p><p> Salinity is one of the natural characteristics in the rivers and groundwater in the coastal belt of Bangladesh. But as global warming leads to rising sea levels in this low-lying country, the salty seawater is moving farther inland. During high tides, ocean salt water enters rivers, and the groundwater has been getting saltier.</p><p> Because of this, the farmers in his village rely on rainwater. But rain is becoming rarer. \"Fresh water is scarce here, especially in winter and spring,\" said Mr Islam. \"Fortunately, it's been raining well this year for the last few days. It's a good sign for farmers like us. However, we also have to watch out for too much rain too, because flooding will not be ideal.\" </p><p> Mr Islam primarily grows rice. But with help from government and international non-governmental organisations, farmers like him are also growing produce that is tolerant to soil salinity, such as watermelons and coriander. </p><p> Apart from causing sea levels to rise, climate change is disrupting Bangladesh's rainfall patterns, leading to both unusual droughts and severe flooding. The once-predictable cycles of wet and dry seasons have become erratic, leaving communities vulnerable to devastating extremes.</p><p>Bangladesh is often referred to as \"ground zero for climate change\" because of its many vulnerabilities. It ranked seventh on the Long-Term Climate Risk Index of countries most affected by climate change from 2000 to 2019, according to the 2021 Global Climate Risk Index report. </p><p> Its vulnerability to climate change is rooted in its combination of geographical, demographic and socio-economic factors.</p><p> The country's low-lying deltaic terrain -- with 75 per cent of its land below sea level -- and coastal location expose it to rising sea levels and cyclones. These challenges are exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure, poverty, high population density and lack of access to education, which amplify the nation's susceptibility to the impacts of a changing climate.</p><p> However, through innovation that blends traditional wisdom with modern technology, this South Asian nation of 170 million people is building resilience to the vagaries of climate change.</p><p> Combining low-tech community practices with high-tech innovations, the government and the people have devised strategies to fortify themselves against rising sea levels and more potent cyclones.</p><p>Bangladeshi farmers have brought back and updated traditional practices such as raised homesteads and floating vegetable gardens that help their families and farms stay afloat amid floods.</p><p> Sophisticated early warning systems and weather forecasting tools, combined with the old-fashioned word-of-mouth spreading of warnings to villagers without mobile phones, offer crucial lead time for people to prepare for disasters.</p><p> Being more resilient has also involved updating and strengthening some of the country's 139 polders or artificial islands below sea level that are reclaimed by building embankments, drainage canals and pumping stations.</p><p> The polders have existed in Bangladesh since the 1960s and they have protected the coastal community from flooding and tidal waves for years, said Mr Krishna Pod Das, a local engineer of the Bangladesh Water Development Board. </p><p> But over time, as climate change forced the sea level to rise, coupled with other factors like gradual erosion over time due to lack of maintenance, the old mechanism of the polders became ineffective, he said.</p><p> In 2013, the board, together with the Department of Agricultural Extension, implemented a project to strengthen, rehabilitate and improve the main water infrastructure of 22 coastal polders with funding from the Netherlands.</p><p> Putting in new sluices and drainage systems and repairing old ones have ensured that water is efficiently managed. \"We can now control when to let the water in or out. We can regulate the intrusion of salt water; we can also expel excess water to prevent flooding and unnecessary water clogging,\" said Mr Das.</p><p> Re-strengthened polders proved to be a lifeline for farmers like Mr Islam, as they reduce salt-water intrusion significantly and expel water when it rains too much, to prevent crop damage.</p><p> Professor Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, a research institute based in Dhaka, said the country has made remarkable progress in adaptation. \"It's a learning-by-doing process,\" he said.</p><p> While these tweaks have succeeded in safeguarding lives and property, the fact remains that as global warming worsens, vulnerable nations will face ever more disasters and their poorest people will bear the fullest impact of these catastrophes.</p><p> \"People living in the worst places in the worst conditions will always get hit first. That is true within a country and also true globally. So poor people are the most vulnerable to climate change and they bear the biggest brunt of it,\" Prof Huq said.</p><p> For all the country's efforts, estimates suggest that by 2050, one in every seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change, and up to 20 million people may have to move because of sea-level rise.</p><p> The battle to build a safety net for its people is not one that Bangladesh can fight alone.

I would like to express my thanks to our friends from Rwanda for inviting me to join this occasion.</p><p>Let me start by congratulating you on this momentous first step that Rwanda is taking to participate in carbon markets aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a pernicious, global challenge. Emissions from one country affect every other country, and for this reason, international cooperation is key.</p><p>Multilateralism was the spirit in which Article 6 of the Paris Agreement was established, to allow countries to pursue voluntary cooperative approaches, and in doing so achieve greater climate ambition than they could on their own. Singapore played a small part in getting Article 6 from an Article in the agreement into the implementation phase, which will allow us to turn Article 6 into reality. We co-facilitated the discussions on implementation at the UNFCCC conferences. Carbon markets have great potential to channel investments toward additional mitigation outcomes that would not have been otherwise feasible.</p><p>Singapore and Rwanda, as fellow small states, share a close working relationship. We have cooperated in areas such as fintech and cybersecurity, and we had a very successful fintech festival in Rwanda this year. I am delighted that our countries are now deepening our cooperation through carbon market collaboration.</p><p>Singapore's approach to this emerging partnership will be underpinned by investment, interlinkages, and resilience.</p><p>First, investment.</p><p>Singapore stands ready to work with our companies to invest in Rwanda's climate future. The Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE) had earlier this year in October 2023 signed an MOU with the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, to deliver projects in areas such as carbon trading. Our companies are keen to explore carbon market projects in Rwanda. We stand ready to work with the Rwandan government to identify projects of highest impact that we can jointly explore.</p><p>Second, interlinkages.</p><p>Singapore is a vibrant carbon services and trading hub, and upholds high environmental integrity standards. We are ready to work with Rwanda to link its carbon credit supply to the global market through Singapore.</p><p>Third, resilience.</p><p>Under our Article 6.2 bilateral approaches, Singapore is prepared to contribute 5% of our share of carbon credit proceeds to support climate adaptation in Rwanda, ensuring that projects have broader sustainable developmental benefits.</p><p>As our two countries sign this Memorandum of Understanding on Article 6 collaboration today, we mark the start of a new chapter of bilateral cooperation; one that addresses our shared challenge of climate change.</p><p>Singapore looks forward to working closely with Rwanda to operationalise high-integrity carbon markets that can drive greater mitigation ambition, create new livelihoods in the green economy, and advance our sustainable development goals.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Source: National Climate Change Secretariat, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Regulatory and Legal]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Singapore is also focused on transitioning to cleaner energy for vehicles and has set a target for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040.

Having made its name in basic manufacturing in the 1970s and precision components in the 1980s, Singapore is now a regional services hub, central to international flows of trade, investment, finance and talent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> To continue that success into the future, Singapore will need to evolve again -- this time to respond to the urgent and complex challenges posed by climate change. </p><p> As daunting as that sounds, this also presents an opportunity for the country to play to two of its core strengths: innovation, to design the clean technology that will help the world decarbonise, and finance, to deliver that technology at scale. </p><p>Singapore is the most innovative economy in Asia, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation's Global Innovation Index, published in September 2023. And the country recently entered the top 10 in a global ranking of start-up ecosystems by US research company Startup Genome, rising to eighth from 18th and overtaking Seoul, Shanghai and Tokyo in the process.</p><p>Singapore's status as a finance and capital hub has also grown in recent years. It now manages around $5 trillion of assets, with more than three-quarters coming from overseas investors.</p><p> With this combination of expertise and financial clout, Singapore is well placed to become a global centre for excellence in cleantech. As the world searches for solutions to the climate crisis, that would be an invaluable next step in the city's ongoing evolution. </p><p> Incentives to actAccelerating cleantech investment will be critical to Singapore's future in more ways than one. </p><p>Singapore is one of the lowest-lying nations in the world, with an average elevation of only 15m above sea level, so it is particularly vulnerable to flooding from rising sea levels. It faces constraints due to its small size and lack of natural resources. Labour costs are high, and access to clean energy is limited by the lack of available land for solar or wind farms. </p><p> On top of all this, Singapore needs to find new ways to create high-quality, future-proofed jobs for citizens at a time when the costs of living and property prices are rising.</p><p> Cleantech helps to solve this development conundrum. It does not require vast amounts of natural resources or low-cost labour. But it can help to position Singapore's economy for long-term growth by leveraging its strengths as a hub for talent, academic research and investment. </p><p> Developing and embracing new technologies for the energy transition -- such as those that can make construction, shipping or aviation less carbon-intensive -- creates an opportunity for Singapore's economy to evolve once again. Supporting and commercialising innovation in these fields will allow the country to maintain a leading position in high-value global supply chains as they decarbonise.</p><p> Leading from the topThe Government has recognised the importance of the green economy and has made cleantech innovation a core component of the nationwide Green Plan. It is supporting research into sustainable technologies through agencies such as the National Environment Agency and the Economic Development Board (EDB), and is promoting itself as a regional hub for new, technology-enabled business models such as carbon trading. The EDB has estimated that carbon trading services could add up to US$5.6 billion (S$7.5 billion) of value to the economy by 2050.</p><p> What's more, initiatives like the Singapore Government-backed Sustainable Development Open Innovation Challenge provide invaluable funding and mentorship to start-ups. And the city's world-class research institutions, such as the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, have centres dedicated to sustainability and cleantech. </p><p> The Government also sees technology as a tool to mobilise financial resources for green investments. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched an ESG Impact Hub in 2022 to support the building of tech solutions to address the environmental, social and governance (ESG) needs of corporates and financial institutions, such as measurement and reporting of climate and sustainability data.</p><p> MAS is also expanding its scope of tax incentives for single-family offices in Singapore to encourage them to invest in local environmental and social causes. That includes extending tax incentive coverage to blended finance structures -- a form of financing typically used to fund sustainable developments -- and recognising overseas climate-related investments.</p><p> Where innovation  and finance meetWith a supportive policy environment, more companies are using Singapore as the springboard for their cleantech ventures. The list of start-ups able to access funding in Singapore includes companies working on agri-tech, green hydrogen, battery recycling, energy efficiency software, energy storage technology and bioenergy. And a number of multinationals have chosen Singapore for major investments into sustainable aviation fuel, bio-based polymers and clean mobility, among others. </p><p> At the early stage of the investment life cycle, Singapore provides ready access to a vibrant ecosystem of 4,000 start-ups, 220 venture capital firms and over 200 accelerators -- many of which are increasingly focused on cleantech and sustainability. </p><p>Singapore-based Antler, for example, has embedded ESG metrics in a partnership that will give Antler's portfolio companies access to banking services from HSBC, including venture debt and working capital.</p><p> Some companies are already building whole business models around cleantech innovation.

Good morning everyone. I was just here earlier for the \"Women in Carbon\" breakfast so happy International Women's Day. To all of you, a warm welcome to Singapore. I really want to thank you for inviting me again for the second edition of Carbon Forward Asia.<br/><br/>2. At last year's Carbon Forward Asia, I spoke of the importance of moving the needle on climate change, and how Singapore can be a catalyst for carbon markets and international cooperation. Last week, at the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Committee of Supply (COS) debate, I also highlighted the need for Singapore to encourage trade flows in areas such as carbon credits. Collectively, we have made important strides both globally and regionally.<br/><br/>Strong Global Momentum on Climate Issues<br/><br/>3. On the global front, 2023 was significant for the completion of the first Global Stocktake (GST) at COP-28 and adoption of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience as part of the UAE Consensus.<br/><br/>4. Although there was little progress on the operationalisation of Article 6.4 at COP-28, Article 6.2 remains operational since the establishment of the rulebook at COP-26 in 2021. Countries are already engaging in Article 6.2 collaboration. Most recently, the world's first Article 6.2 transaction was completed between Switzerland and Thailand. This has set the stage for more Article 6.2 transactions to come, and we are confident many more high-quality projects will continue to come from Asia.<br/><br/>Carbon Market Developments in Asia<br/><br/>5. Asia has been actively developing international carbon markets. Allow me to update you on some of these developments.<br/><br/>a. Malaysia's Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX) completed its first carbon credit auction in March 2023.<br/><br/>b. Indonesia launched its first carbon exchange IDX, in September last year 2023.<br/><br/>c. Vietnam has announced plans to pilot a carbon trade exchange next year with full operations expected in 2028.<br/><br/>d. Thailand submitted its Premium T-VERS (Premium Thailand Voluntary Emissions Reduction Program) for CORSIA eligibility in May last year.<br/><br/>e. Bhutan became the first country to be fully integrated with Climate Action Data Trust (CAD Trust) to prevent the double counting of carbon credits. It also announced the substantive conclusion of negotiations with Singapore on a legally-binding agreement for Article 6 collaboration in Dec last year.<br/><br/>f. In January this year, Cambodia launched its operations manual for the Implementation of Article 6.<br/><br/>6. Countries are also working together for progress. In September 2023, ASEAN adopted the Strategy for Carbon Neutrality to accelerate the region's transition towards carbon neutrality. One of its goals is to develop carbon markets that are interoperable with one another and with global markets. 2023 also saw the launch of the \"ASEAN Alliance on Carbon Markets\" (AACM), the first private sector led body aiming to support the growth of both voluntary and compliance markets in the region.<br/><br/>7. We firmly believe that Asia is poised to play a pivotal role for international carbon markets, and Singapore is committed to unlock its full potential.<br/><br/>Singapore's Commitment to Carbon Markets<br/><br/>8. On the sidelines of COP-28, Singapore signed our first Implementation Agreement, or \"IA\", with Papua New Guinea on carbon credits collaboration. I am glad I can share this here, almost one year after I met with Simo Kilepa, the Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change of Papua New Guinea, who was in Singapore for the inaugural Carbon Forward Asia. The IA between Singapore and Papua New Guinea sets out a legally binding framework between two countries, to enable the international transfer of carbon credits aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.<br/><br/>9. There are three key principles undergirding the IAs which we are working on:<br/><br/>10. First, to enable high quality carbon credits projects to be developed to generate benefits for the host country in the form of sustainable development outcomes, including bringing investments and new jobs. Singapore published our Environmental Integrity (EI) criteria last year. Our Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment has also established an International Advisory Panel for Carbon Credits (IAPCC) to advise Singapore on maintaining a robust and transparent carbon market.<br/><br/>11. Second, to enable faster time-to-market. Singapore's IAs are designed to tap on existing carbon crediting programmes and methodologies. This allows us to ramp up the operationalisation of our IAs and provides more clarity for project developers. Singapore published our List of Eligible Methodologies in December for the Papua New Guinea Agreement, which includes methodologies under Gold Standard, Verified Carbon Standard, American Carbon Registry and Global Carbon Council.<br/><br/>12. Third, to support climate adaptation in host countries and also overall mitigation of global emissions. Singapore's IAs support host countries by contributing a 5% share of all authorised carbon credits towards climate adaption in these countries. We will also cancel 2% of all authorised carbon credits as an additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions (OMGE).<br/><br/>Singapore's Commitment to Green Finance/Transition<br/><br/>13. Beyond these G2G agreements, Singapore is also expending efforts to address the region's growing green and transition finance needs, which are necessary for the growth of the carbon markets.<br/><br/>14. Last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the launch of a new Transition Credits Coalition, called \"TRACTION\". This coalition of ecosystem players will help identify barriers and potential solutions to develop transition credits as a viable market solution, such as credits from the early retirement of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs).<br/><br/>15. MAS also launched a new blended finance platform called Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, or \"FAST-P\", which aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to de-risk and finance transition and marginally bankable green projects in Asia.<br/><br/>Working with the Private Sector<br/><br/>16. We need to keep innovating and improving on our existing approaches to accelerate climate action. This is not something that governments can do alone.<br/><br/>17. We need businesses and ecosystem players to continue the momentum set last year. These include companies who are innovating to support the development of carbon markets. In the last few years, we have seen innovations in areas including insurance for carbon credits, such as with carbon credit insurers Kita, and ratings agencies providing independent ratings on projects such as with Sylvera and BeZero. We are glad these companies have decided to establish a presence in Singapore.<br/><br/>18. Today, we have over 120 companies in our carbon services and trading ecosystem. We welcome the incubation of more of these businesses in Singapore and are keen to be involved in the co-creation of solutions to spur on the developments of carbon markets, especially in Asia.<br/><br/>Closing<br/><br/>19. Let's work together to continue supporting a thriving and growing carbon services and trading ecosystem to capture opportunities in a low-carbon future.<br/><br/>20. I wish the organisers a successful and fruitful event.<br/><br/>21.

One year after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor (GDSC), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach have completed a comprehensive baselining study. It forecasts more green jobs, health improvements for local communities and economic benefits for participating countries, emphasising the future demand for zero and near-zero emission fuels and the benefits from decarbonising the shipping routes between the nations.</p><p>2. The study, commissioned by C40 and the ports, and conducted by the American Bureau of Shipping, analysed maritime trade flows between Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach, and provided a baseline of activities and energy demand requirements for vessels operating on the corridor through to 2050. The conclusion of the study follows the successful unveiling of the corridor's Partnership Strategy at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28/CMP18/CMA5) in December 2023, which outlined the corridor's goals, partnership structure and governance mechanism. The study estimates the quantity of near-zero and zero-emission fuels required for this traffic by modelling the adoption of zero and near-zero carbon alternative fuels by vessels operating on the corridor through to 2050, considering various parameters such as fuel production costs and fuel availability, and in view of the targets in the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships[1]. The study can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://c40.me/3xF60Yw\">https://c40.me/3xF60Yw</url>.</p><p>3. On a practical level, the study highlights the potential socio-economic impact of transitioning to zero and near-zero emission fuels and leveraging on digital solutions. Based on the study's estimates, the corridor at full implementation could create over 700 new job opportunities in zero and near-zero emission fuel production and improve local air quality. These estimates support findings by C40 and other organisations that activities undertaken through green shipping corridors can catalyse wider decarbonisation across the maritime industry and unlock health benefits for local communities and green economy opportunities for participating countries.</p><p>4. As leading global ports, Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach are vital nodes on the trans-Pacific shipping lane and are key stakeholders in the maritime sector's green and digital transition. Alongside 20 leading ports and port cities, MPA, POLA, and POLB are members of C40's Green Ports Forum, a prominent global platform for collaborative climate action that actively champions ambitious green shipping corridors, acknowledging their central role in the ports and shipping sectors' green transition.</p><p>5. The corridor partners underscore their dedication to a data-driven decision-making approach through the study, utilising its insights to guide their actions in pursuing the partnership's decarbonisation objectives and aligning with the decarbonisation goals of the shipping sector. Key findings of the study include:</p><p>* Vessels operating on the corridor represent 7% of the world's container trade, which is about 1% of Singapore's, 14.5% of Port of Long Beach's, and 20% of Port of Los Angeles' traffic.</p><p>*The projected annual energy demand of vessels on the corridor is estimated to be approximately 60,000 terajoules (TJ), equivalent to approximately two months of Singapore's national electricity generation.</p><p>*Shipping demand on the corridor is estimated to be around 850,000 tons of methanol and 160,000 tons of ammonia annually by 2030, displacing the equivalent GHG emissions from almost 320,000 cars annually.</p><p>*The transition to zero and near-zero emission fuels could potentially create approximately 700 jobs in the production and supply chain of such fuels by 2030.</p><p>6. The partnership convened the first in-person stakeholder meeting of the corridor together with industry value-chain representatives, as a prelude to onboarding stakeholders to the corridor. The meeting was held during Singapore Maritime Week (SMW) 2024 on 18 April.</p><p>7. The meeting and subsequent working groups will focus on developing green and digital solutions to address the following focus areas within the corridor:</p><p>1. Enable the supply and adoption of zero and near-zero emissions fuels (e.g. green ammonia, green methanol) at scale, including safety, emergency response, mitigation and standards-setting.</p><p>2. Develop and scale-up the adoption of energy efficiency solutions, including through digital tools (e.g. route optimisation, remote monitoring) and technologies that reduce fuel consumption (e.g. wind-assisted propulsion).</p><p>3. Develop and encourage the adoption of digital technologies to support the monitoring, reporting and verification of GHG emissions along the corridor.</p><p>8. All three ports will participate in the Accelerating Digitalisation and Decarbonisation Conference organised by MPA as part of SMW 2024 and in a moderated discussion convened by C40 on the sidelines of SMW 2024 entitled 'Navigating Collaboration: Governance of Green Shipping Corridor Partnerships', where C40 will unveil its new report and share insights into best practices for GDSC effective governance.</p><p>9. Mr Teo Eng Dih, Chief Executive of MPA, said: \"Shipping is a new pillar in the multi-faceted partnership with the US. The GDSC with the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach highlights the importance of working with industry, researchers, government and society through innovation and capacity building. With traffic along the GDSC accounting for 7% of the world's container trade, the initiatives by GDSC partners and stakeholders will help generate growth and new opportunities for maritime professionals.\"</p><p>10. Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said: \"This study provides a sense of scale and scope to inform our implementation of the Green and Digital Shipping Corridor. Achieving the reductions of greenhouse gas emissions required will take coordination and commitment from public and private stakeholders across the maritime and goods movement industries. We're proud to be collaborating with industry partners to make this corridor a reality.\"</p><p>11. \"The Port of Long Beach and its partners have been very successful reducing emissions from cargo-handling equipment, trucks and other mobile sources moving cargo in our harbor,\" said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero. \"One of the most important parts of this partnership is it allows us to better understand and target a source of emissions that is hard for us to control as a local seaport authority - shipborne emissions. This work, vital to our net zero-emission quest, will result in economic and health benefits all along the trans-Pacific trade corridor.\"</p><p>12. C40 Executive Director, Mark Watts said: \"Accelerating efforts to decarbonise the shipping sector is urgent if we are to limit global heating to 1.5C. C40 is proud to support this first-mover initiative which has the potential not only to support the development and uptake of low- and zero-carbon fuels and vessels, but also create good green jobs and health benefits for local communities by doing so.\"</p><p>About the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)</p><p>MPA was established on 2 February 1996 with the mission to develop Singapore as a premier global hub port and international maritime centre, and to advance and safeguard Singapore's strategic maritime interests.

An added benefit is that issuers will be encouraged to develop a robust corporate governance framework, including the extent of the board's and management's involvement, skills and competency, accountability, and remuneration policy. Here, we suggest issuers disclose the identity of the designated key individual or chairman of the committee responsible for climate-related matters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Strategy:</emphasis></p><p>Current: significant climate-related issues, management policies, and strategies</p><p>Proposed: material climate-related risks and opportunities, transition plans, setting of targets, climate resilience strategy, scenario analysis, financial impacts (current and anticipated)</p><p>The concept of 'materiality' is emphasised here when issuers are required to disclose material climate-related issues and their corresponding impacts. Materiality can be interpreted in different ways, such as financial materiality, double materiality, or dynamic materiality. We seek to clarify the definition of materiality in the Code. As an investor organization, we have long advocated for quality and science-based information reporting, and assessment of climate resilience based on scenario analysis commensurate with an issuer's circumstances.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Risk management:</emphasis></p><p>Current: processes of evaluating, prioritising, and managing material ESG related issues, and their effectiveness </p><p>Proposed: process to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and integration to overall risk management framework</p><p>We are happy to see a more comprehensive list of disclosure requirements, in particular the basis for risk prioritization, and the interaction between climate and the overall risk management framework. Meanwhile, the HKEX itself may also need to demonstrate the proportionality of the requirements and the need to prioritize climate-related risks over other types of risks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Metrics and Targets:</emphasis></p><p>Current: environmental KPIs, such as GHG emissions Scope 1 and 2, based on 'comply or explain' basis </p><p>Proposed: GHG emissions Scope 1, 2, and 3 with cross-industry metrics on physical and transition risks, climate-related opportunities, and capital deployment. Other metrics include linkage to internal carbon price, remuneration, and industry-based metrics (optional) </p><p>Carbon footprint, especially Scope 3 emissions, will be an effective metric to convey the transition risk faced by an issuer. The location of information also matters as it will determine the subsequent level of assurance. CFA Institute and CFA Society Hong Kong appreciate taxonomy-based and quantifiable metrics, as comparability is the lifeblood of investment analysis. We also appreciate the higher transparency on an issuer's mitigation and adaptation responses, i.e., capital deployment, linkage to remuneration, and internal carbon price.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oversight and Proportionate Approach</emphasis></p><p>When it comes to Appendix 27 of the Listing Rules, the proposed enhancement has made Hong Kong an early mover in climate reporting. The quality and relevance of the disclosures, however, will be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/comment-letter/2020-2024/SEC-Climate-Letter-1.pdf\">highly dependent</url> on the issuers' oversight. The TCFD's own study of the application of its guidance also suggested weak compliance.</p><p>With HKEX's enhanced requirements, this will naturally improve, given the liability concerns that should be commensurate with the evolving nature of climate-related disclosure. However, to be decision-useful, the compliance element of the proposal will require persistent monitoring from HKEX and relevant authorities.</p><p>As a step forward or as an interim measure, we also suggest HKEX leverage the existing financial reporting mechanism and regulatory framework to require the issuers to disclose material climate-related risks and opportunities and related material information contained in the ESG report in their audited financial statements. This can impose a healthy level of assurance for the quality of relevant disclosures and enhance stakeholder confidence.</p><p>It is vital to balance climate ambitions with practicality. \u00a0More guidance and clarification on details help secure buy-in from a range of stakeholders. In particular, a proportionate approach to climate disclosure with differentiated requirements is needed for the GEM issuers, who are facing proportionality challenges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A long journey ahead</emphasis></p><p>CFA Institute and CFA Society Hong Kong support disclosures based upon the global baselines ISSB and TCFD. IFRS S1 and S2 are important frameworks going in parallel for multi-period and multi-jurisdictional efforts towards improving the quality of climate-related disclosures. Therefore, we encourage the HKEX to place priority on aligning with IFRS S1, following the integration of S2 into Appendix 27 of the Listing Rules.</p><p>We also advocate for the HKEX to continue its efforts in broader engagement and assist issuers with capacity building. Apart from engaging with issuers to raise awareness and collect their feedback on implementation learnings, investor engagement is equally important, given that they are the audience of the reports and users of the proposed Code with respect to stewardship.</p><p>Lastly, we encourage the HKEX to continue offering capacity-building support, transitional reliefs, and incentives for upskilling on climate-related matters, while connecting with other markets in the region to participate in the global conversation and transition journey.</p><p>--</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Co-authored by Sivananth Ramachandran (Director of Capital Markets Policy, India at CFA Institute), Phoebe Chan (Capital Markets Policy Specialist at CFA Institute) and CFA Society Hong Kong.</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "Regulation Asia", "instances": ["An added benefit is that issuers will be encouraged to develop a robust corporate governance framework, including the extent of the board's and management's involvement, skills and competency, accountability, and remuneration policy.

Most of us barely give it a thought. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Yet, we depend on these grids to keep our lives ticking. They are set to expand rapidly as populations grow and economies use more electricity. They are also widening their reach to tap more green energy sources. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But what if these grids are increasingly likely to let us down'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Grids are at risk of being damaged by worsening climate impacts, especially more powerful storms and floods and more intense heatwaves and cold snaps. This can lead to outages. Without greater investment in resilience, they risk becoming a weak link. </p><p> A recent disaster in the Australian state of Victoria is a stark reminder. </p><p> On Feb 13, 2024, six high-voltage transmission towers collapsed during a powerful storm south-west of Melbourne. More than 500,000 homes and businesses lost power across the state. </p><p> The blackout was not a one-off. Similar collapses have occurred in recent years in southern Australia.</p><p> \"Climate change is increasing the risk of outages due to the increased frequency, severity and distribution of extreme weather events,\" said the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its Climate Resilience for Energy Security report released in November 2022.</p><p> \"Electricity networks are the leading cause of climate-driven outages in many countries and are considered the element of the power system most vulnerable to climate impacts,\" it says. And these outages are costly in terms of disruption to people, communications and businesses. </p><p> Grids comprise long-distance transmission lines that connect states within countries or cross national borders. The power is then channelled to the local distribution grid, which delivers power to customers. </p><p> The technology exists to make grids more resilient and is already being deployed, but it needs to be rolled out faster and at scale. The IEA says grid investment needs to double to more than US$600 billion (S$806.3 billion) a year by the end of the decade, a large portion of it in Asia. </p><p> \"There's an increasing imperative that we need to do this much faster because we just don't have time, both from a climate perspective and an ageing infrastructure perspective, which is being impacted by climate change,\" said Mr Scott Hamilton, senior adviser to Australia's Smart Energy Council, an industry-funded body.</p><p> Australia, like many nations, has to simultaneously upgrade ageing grid infrastructure as it builds thousands of kilometres of new transmission lines to connect scores of large solar, wind and battery storage projects around the country, many in rural areas, he said. It's an immense and costly challenge as the climate risks grow, bringing storms, flash floods and forest fires in their wake. </p><p> Storms, floods and fires\"These events are causing more of these impacts. It's only a matter of time until another one happens in Australia or another part of the world,\" said Mr Hamilton, an adjunct associate professor at Melbourne's Monash University.</p><p> About a quarter of global electricity networks are exposed to severe storms, and more than 10 per cent are exposed to tropical cyclones, particularly in North America, Australia and East Asia, the IEA says.</p><p> In January 2005, when storm Gudrun hit Sweden, outages in rural areas lasted up to 20 days because of damaged distribution lines, while those in urban areas with underground cabling lasted only a few hours, the IEA report said. </p><p>Swedish network operators lost around EUR250 million (S$365 million). But the broader losses to ordinary people and businesses due to the interruptions were estimated at EUR3 billion.  </p><p> Nearly half of global power networks are also exposed to fire weather conditions for more than 50 days a year -- and close to 18 per cent of the global electricity network sees more than 200 fire weather days annually, the IEA said. Australia, California and southern Europe are especially vulnerable.</p><p> Grid expectationsDespite the risks, investment in green power is charging ahead. </p><p> The United Nations COP28 climate conference in Dubai in December 2023 set the world a great green goal. Nearly 200 nations backed a target to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030.</p><p> Wiring up all this additional green power is going to require a lot of poles and wires. </p><p> The IEA said the world's electricity use needs to grow 20 per cent faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one to meet national climate goals. This means adding or refurbishing more than 80 million km of national grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid. </p><p> Rystad Energy, in a research note on Feb 15, 2024, said US$3.1 trillion of grid infrastructure investments is needed before 2030 if the world is to limit global warming to 1.8 deg C above pre-industrial levels. Under this scenario, an additional 18 million km of grid network would be needed to keep up with the growing electrification under way across cities and countries as economies expand, including new renewable energy capacity and the rapid adoption of electric vehicles and more electrical appliances. </p><p> Asia is set to contribute more than half of the global additions this decade, with China and India leading the way as the world's largest and third-largest power consumers, Rystad said. \"We predict global grid investments will reach US$374 billion this year, with China accounting for about 30 per cent of the total.\" </p><p> China is leading the world with record additions of solar and wind energy capacity and has been building long-distance transmission lines to bring that power to the heavily populated coastal hinterland. It added just over 38,000 km in each of the past two years -- that's nearly twice the distance around the planet at the Equator. </p><p> But worsening storms and floods present a growing challenge, especially at the local level. Record flooding in Zhengzhou in Henan province in July 2021 knocked out power and communications for days to the worst-hit parts of the city of 13 million people. </p><p> China has invested heavily in research and development of its grid, boosting interconnections and strengthening weather forecasting, among other key steps. </p><p> \"Electricity reliability is highly prioritised by China's government,\" said Beijing-based Ms Yujing Liu, principal, China power decarbonisation, for the Rocky Mountain Institute, a US think-tank. </p><p> But she added that more needs to be done to strengthen the much larger distribution grid at the local level, where development and investment are lacking. </p><p> In Europe, grid operators and European Union regulators are increasingly focused on climate-proofing the transmission network. The Renewables Grid Initiative (RGI), a collaboration of non-governmental organisations and European transmission system operators, is helping to promote a greener and resilient grid. </p><p> \"Over the long term, electricity grid infrastructure resilience measures can not only increase security of supply and reduce overall operation and maintenance costs, but also further contribute to climate change mitigation as the electricity grid integrates more renewable energy,\" said Dr Andrzej Ceglarz, RGI's director of energy systems. </p><p> Costs, though, remain a concern for grid operators, he said. </p><p> The EU's Trans-European Network for Energy Regulation sets out rules for cross-border energy infrastructure and promotes the integration of renewables. It also explicitly promotes the need for climate adaptation measures, which will increase the grid's resilience, Dr Ceglarz said.</p><p> For green energy investors and asset managers, a climate-proof grid is essential. Macquarie Asset Management, a major global renewable energy investor, says companies in its portfolio, including utilities, have been strengthening their networks, including using sensors, drones and geospatial technologies to anticipate and manage extreme weather events. </p><p> SolutionsOne key solution is burying power cables underground. Tokyo is doing this as part of its climate adaptation plan. </p><p>Singapore has gone one step further and built a cross-island network of transmission cable tunnels 60m below ground. Completed in 2019, the 40km network not only protects high-voltage power lines, but also makes it easier to repair and replace them. </p><p> In Finland, Elenia, the nation's second-largest power grid operator, has a long-term programme to put 90 per cent of its electricity network underground by 2036. By the end of 2023, nearly two-thirds of its 76,600km network had been buried. </p><p> This solution is generally more expensive and is not foolproof -- underground cables are vulnerable to heatwaves and construction accidents from road, telecoms and building construction. But burying power lines generally boosts reliability and reduces downtime. </p><p> Other steps include designing stronger transmission towers, more frequent visual inspections of power lines, especially those vulnerable to wildfires, and regular pruning of trees and branches as well as grass in fire-prone areas. </p><p> Traditional power lines carrying two to four wires are also vulnerable to high winds as the wires can touch each other, causing sparks. One solution is highly insulated cables that bundle the power cables tightly. </p><p> Building in redundancy is another way to reduce outages. Increasing interconnections between different parts of the grid gives operators greater chances to reroute power during emergencies. </p><p> There's another solution that means no grid connection at all: distributed renewable energy. </p><p> Power to the peopleThese are mini-grids, in which a community's electricity is generated locally from solar, wind or pumped hydro and is supported by battery storage. It's a solution for rich and poor nations alike, such as remote towns or remote islands -- or places that have never been connected to the grid. </p><p> Some Indonesian islands are shifting away from diesel-powered generation to renewable energy mini-grids, for example. </p><p> \"One of the real advantages of having a big investment in distributed energy, or community energy, is you don't really need to build these massive transmission lines,\" said Mr Hamilton. </p><p> One example is Yackandandah, a town of 2,000 people in north-east Victoria, which is close to achieving 100 per cent renewable energy generation from rooftop solar and community batteries. The project has been in development for several years and is widely supported by the community and the state government. </p><p> And it is just one of a growing number of similar projects in Australia in which communities are going green, cutting their power bills and aiming to be self-reliant for electricity. Distributed energy systems have the potential to reduce or avoid significant power network and generation costs in the years ahead, some experts say. </p><p> Missing linkFor now, though, grids will be needed to channel the energy from the many large solar, wind and battery projects being built or planned globally. These investments are a key part of cutting reliance on polluting fossil fuels that are driving climate change. </p><p> But for that to work, grids of the future must remain reliable and resilient and cope with everything that climate change can throw at them. </p><p> There's still a lot of work to do, says the IEA. </p><p> Governments need to prioritise grid investment and national adaptation strategies need to include clear action plans to strengthen the power transmission network. Weak grids will only hold back the global fight against climate change and prove very costly down the line. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The blackout was not a one-off.

Recent estimates suggest that US$175 billion to US$459 billion in funding is needed per year for a sustainable ocean. </p><p> While the public sector and donor communities have been playing a critical role in preserving the ocean, there is still much work to do, given the pace and scale of declining ocean health, and private sector capital can play a catalytic role in addressing the funding gap. </p><p> Accelerating ocean actions around the worldLeaders around the world increasingly recognise our dependence and impact on the ocean. Oceans are one of the four key nature realms of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures framework, established to factor nature into financial and business decisions. </p><p> We see global calls for renewed vigour in ocean protection via various initiatives, including the Ocean Action in 2023 statement, the creation of a Universal Declaration of Ocean Rights and the Global Plastics Treaty, which aims to end plastic pollution. </p><p> At the recent COP28 with the largest ocean pavilion to date, key positive commitments around sustainable oceans included the Joint Declaration on Ocean and Climate Action, which urges countries to consider ocean-based actions in their national climate goals and sustainably manage 100 per cent of the ocean under national jurisdictions. </p><p> This declaration complements the world's first \"Treaty of the High Seas\" signed by 84 countries as at Dec 18. This is a significant step towards protecting the high seas, which encompasses two-thirds of the world's oceans, and addresses the issue that only about 1 per cent has been under any protection protocol so far. </p><p> There were more than 50 announcements towards decarbonising shipping under the Green Shipping Challenge. At the COP28 Singapore Pavilion, there was a signing of a memorandum of understanding between Pacific International Lines and DP World to jointly develop initiatives to decarbonise their shipments' footprint, aligning with the Maritime Singapore Green Initiative. </p><p> Moreover, 21 countries formally endorsed the Mangrove Breakthrough to protect and restore 15 million ha of mangroves globally by 2030. The International Blue Carbon Institute, launched in Singapore in 2022, aims to protect and scale the blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, kelp and tidal marshes. </p><p> In Singapore, numerous steps have also been taken to strengthen its marine and coastal protection and blue economy alongside its Green Plan 2030, focusing on areas from harnessing ocean renewable energy, decarbonising the maritime industry and fostering a circular economy, to rejuvenating coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass. </p><p> An ocean of opportunities  for investors The blue economy continues to expand, buoyed by the above myriad of enabling factors. </p><p> Investors can consider taking a holistic approach by: </p><p> Investors can find opportunities in diverse sectors within the blue economy, ranging from transport, fisheries, aquaculture, energy, biotechnology, tourism, ecosystem management, waste and water management to the circular economy.

Projections by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore suggest that the city-state could experience an increase in daily mean temperature of 1.4C to 4.6C towards the end of this century.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate researchers have attributed Singapore's rising temperatures to both global warming and the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Asphalt and concrete from urban development have replaced greenery and waterways, trapping more heat. The UHI effect (Singapore's Central Region has the highest mean UHI intensity according to research) increases energy costs due to a higher usage of air conditioning which in turn contributes to air pollution triggered by increased electricity consumption.</p><p>The UHI phenomenon reduces thermal comfort and discourages people from walking or cycling. Besides heat-related illnesses, other climate-related concerns include flash floods and sea level rise. As a low-lying coastal island, Singapore's mean sea level rise is estimated to be up to one metre by 2100. MSS data suggests that the average sea level around the island today is 14cm above pre-1970 levels. In view of these challenges, \"good\" climate education plays an important role in imparting climate resilience into our youth. At SMU, all undergraduates get some exposure to sustainability issues in the course of their university education, particularly via compulsory core curriculum courses such as Big Questions and Ethics &amp; Social Responsibility, various sustainability-related course initiatives (eg SMU's Lee Kong Chian School of Business offers a second major in Sustainability) and projects with industry.</p><p>Vision-driven learning outcomes in our own courses on communication, information systems and smart city management include effective climate change communication so that students understand climate change risks (and act on climate change); prototyping mobile applications (Apps) to calculate (and reduce) one's carbon footprint or food/water wastage in line with the 5Rs methodology (refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, recycle); and designing (executing) appropriate responses to protect oneself from negative climate change consequences.</p><p>Through guided educational trips to one of Singapore's waste-to-energy plants (with their huge waste storage bunkers), students also see for themselves how the incineration process works with real time exposure to national waste management issues such as the plastic pollution crisis. Without actionable climate literacy, climate change risk perceptions will remain low, and pro-environmental behaviours of students will run into the void.</p><p>MORAL PERSUASION DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK</p><p>While our youths are generally very obliging and eager to participate in actionable assignments such as measuring the total amount of greenhouse gases that are generated by their actions or explaining the role of carbon pricing in sustaining a green environment, translating concrete offsetting ideas - such as planting trees or mangroves - into reality is tough. Moral persuasion does not always work. Some of the barriers we have come across include competing priorities such as GPA concerns, no real acknowledgement that the climate catastrophe is indeed \"real\" (it seems inconceivable that the perennial Arctic ice cap has shrunk by more than a million square miles over the past half century), strong system trust in the ability of the government to take care of combatting urban warming, and lack of deep knowledge of local climate impacts and solutions.</p><p>Key climate change messages about the risk of global warming (even those formulated by expert panels) don't always work as intended for a number of reasons: one, humans suffer from confirmation bias, which is the tendency to seek out and interpret information in a way that confirms our pre-existing opinions, values and beliefs - it is one of the strongest biases we hold. Conversely, we have a tendency to disregard or ignore information that contradicts or challenges our opinions, values and beliefs. Another challenge is that our mental models have narrow temporal boundaries and focus on the short term. This short-term focus leads to judgment errors and biases in situations where the consequences of our actions span swathes of space and time.</p><p>What then can be done to enable Singapore's youths to better understand what lies ahead in an era of climate change, appreciate the limits of growth, and effect constructive change? Nudging them towards more eco-friendly behavioural habits (using fans rather than air-con; walking rather than driving; composting organic waste; harvesting of rainwater; reducing consumption; decreasing social media consumption etc) is arguably a feasible approach to build greater climate resilience.</p><p>Since Thaler and Sunstein's 2008 publication of \"Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness\", there has been great interest across public policy domains in what drives the behaviour and decision-making logic of individuals and groups. Instead of traditional compliance methods such as education, legislation or enforcement, nudging puts emphasis on reinforcement and indirect suggestions as influence strategies.</p><p>According to Thaler and Sunstein, a nudge is \"any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives\". Examples of nudges are the deterrent disease pictures on cigarette packs encouraging smokers to reduce cigarette consumption through emotional responses or the rumble strip on highways that let drivers know if they are drifting out of the lane.</p><p>In the context of urban climate change mitigation, nudging can be used to become carbon-neutral in support of sustainability and liveability goals. For example, commuters can be influenced to modify transport-related choices aimed at minimising carbon emissions and congestion through personalised \"active\" push notifications that nudge them to optimise personal (green) routes without getting stuck in traffic.</p><p>To be sustainable, successful climate education must be embedded into science-based, experiential teaching and learning approaches on site. Two useful preparatory resources are Al Gore's documentary film An Inconvenient Truth (2006) and the author videos featuring Dennis Meadows (emeritus professor of systems policy and social science research at the University of New Hampshire), co-author of the 1972 book \"The Limits to Growth\" with his concerns for the declining availability of energy, rising disruptions from climate change, falling agricultural yields from loss of arable land, growing costs of environmental services such as breathable air and survivable temperatures.</p><p>Relevant local sites for nudge-related excursions include the redeveloped Kallang Bishan waterway which transformed a concrete 2.7kilometre canal (Kallang River) into a 3km sinuous, natural river, with bio-engineered river edges using various plants and bedding materials; Cambridge Road Estate, a low lying site with a historical record of flooding and limited capacity to increase drain size any further (where several stakeholders including government bodies, citizens and design firms collaborate to build community resilience and blue-green infrastructure); Pulau Ubin's Chek Jawa Wetlands with its six natural habitats (sandy beach, rocky beach, seagrass lagoon, coral rubble, mangroves and coastal forest) and sea-based fish farms.</p><p>A weekend stay on a kelong to study the impact of shifting climatic patterns on traditional fish farming (the increase in water temperature can lead to more bacteria, viruses and microbiomes) combined with a boat trip to the new AI-powered Singapore Aquaculture Technologies' (SAT) smart fish farm (Aquaculture 4.0) or an excursion to Lazarus Island to see how its man-made sea walls with its \"rescued corals\" can reduce the loss of marine biodiversity, seem like attractive climate education and learning approaches. However, the empirical evidence base to come up with the \"right\" behavioural (nudging) interventions during such site visits is still very weak.</p><p>CLIMATE CATASTROPHE</p><p>Other nudging-related challenges faced by climate stakeholders include ethical implications (eg \"unacceptable paternalism\") and a lack of understanding of how to design effective technology-mediated nudges. With regard to digital commitment nudges towards more eco-friendly behaviour (an interesting example is Powerbar developed by Stanford ChangeLabs whose unique behaviour-changing interface design is aimed at reducing residential energy consumption), there is a need to skillfully manage the iterative behavioural design processes and systems testing for optimal behaviour-change purposes. While specialised behavioural design consulting firms and behavioural insights teams (= nudge units) will have the required competencies to alter people's behaviour in predictable ways, an open question is: to what extent do \"non-tech\" university instructors command such specialised competencies'</p><p>In view of the climate catastrophe (a \"hard problem\" which requires sacrifices now to reap benefits later, according to Professor Meadows), climate-related skills upgrading measures with an emphasis on earth science, climatology, behavioural science-informed technology interventions (nudging), human-centric design, systems thinking-inspired games relevant to climate-change communication, public-private-people partnership (4P) approaches, citizen science, volunteer conservation action etc are indispensable if we want to effectively support our youth in adapting to life in a changing climate and to engineer a new sustainable system.</p><p>The writers are from Singapore Management University (SMU).<br/>Thomas Menkhoff is professor of Organisational Behaviour and Human Resources (Education), Lee Kong Chian School of Business; Mark Chong is associate professor of Communication Management (Practice), at the School.

The transcript of SMS Sim's speech is appended.</p><p>National Statement by Senior Minister of State For Foreign Affairs and National Development of Singapore Sim Ann at the Second Part of the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries</p><p>Mr President, Excellencies,</p><p>1. Let me first convey Singapore's appreciation to the Government of Qatar and the United Nations for organising this important meeting.</p><p>2. When we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, we made the fundamental commitment to \"leave no one behind\". We have now reached the critical mid-point of our journey. There is great urgency to reaffirm this core commitment and step up our efforts to address the needs and priorities of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).</p><p>3. In May last year, the UN Secretary-General warned that the \"very viability of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030\" is at risk. The LDCs are among those facing the greatest difficulties. They have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.</p><p>4. But there are also opportunities to \"rescue\" the SDGs as highlighted by the Secretary-General. This Conference is one such opportunity. We need to fulfil our commitment to the LDCs through concrete and collective action. Allow me to highlight four areas where we should focus our efforts: First, supporting climate resilience. The LDCs are the least responsible for climate change but are among the hardest hit. To help the LDCs build long-term resilience against the impact of climate change, we need to significantly scale up technical and financial support from the international community. In this regard, we strongly support the target of allocating 50 percent of climate financing to climate adaptation.</p><p>5. Second, closing the financing gap. Widening fiscal deficits and increased debt burden are hampering the ability of LDCs to eradicate poverty, respond to external shocks, invest in their people, and build inclusive societies. We must reform the global financial architecture to provide the scale and reliability of financing required to achieve the SDGs.</p><p>6. Third, accelerating digital transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital technology worldwide, but it has also laid bare the huge digital divide among and within countries. Only 25 percent of people in the LDCs use the Internet, compared to 80 percent in advanced economies. If we are serious about closing the digital divide, we will need to step up efforts to promote universal connectivity, enhance digital skills and training, and invest in digital infrastructure.</p><p>7. Fourth, strengthening global partnerships. Our experience with COVID-19 has shown that multilateral cooperation is the best way forward. Singapore strongly supports the Doha Programme of Action's call for a renewed and strengthened global partnership with South-South cooperation as an important pillar. Since 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme or SCP has been our platform for technical cooperation with developing countries. It originated as a way for Singapore to share our development experience and pay forward the assistance that we had received during our formative years. We have cooperated with UN agencies to deliver programmes in the Asia-Pacific and Africa. Our Third Country partnerships, including those with Chile, Japan, Qatar, Thailand, Trkiye, and the US, have facilitated North-South and South-South Cooperation. To date, we have welcomed close to 150,000 government officials as part of our SCP programmes, with more than 40 percent from the LDCs. This year, we will launch a three-year Sustainability Action Package to support capacity-building for all developing countries, focusing on resilience building strategies, green project management and financing, as well as carbon market development. We will continue to work with our partners to pool resources and expertise to better meet the needs of LDCs.</p><p>Excellencies,</p><p>8. As a global community, we must not leave anyone behind in our collective journey towards the SDGs. In line with the theme of this conference, \"From Potential to Prosperity\", let us work together to support the LDCs to realise their vast potential and achieve a prosperous future.</p><p>9.

Santa has hit turbulence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> So it must seem to many market watchers that the much-anticipated year-end Santa Claus rally hit a bit of tumult last week as market conviction about a Federal Reserve rate-hike pause weakened somewhat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial index ended the week flat at 36,247.87, while the broader S&amp;P 500 rose barely 0.2 per cent last week to its Dec 8 close at 4,604.37 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.7 per cent to 14,403.97 points as enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and tech-driven plays remained intact, though somewhat subdued.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That said, all three major indexes were up by over 4.3 per cent for the week, giving Wall Street its longest weekly winning streak in almost three years.</p><p> In Singapore, the Straits Times Index edged up 0.7 per cent for the week to 3,110.73 points, though lacklustre volumes suggested that interest in local stocks remains subdued. With valuations looking compelling -- stocks are trading at under 12 times earnings, average 0.8 times book value, and offering a forward dividend yield of 5 per cent -- there is increasing concern within market circles about the need to resuscitate the moribund local bourse. </p><p> No one has an answer, though. Perhaps Singapore-based funds should be compelled to invest a portion of their monies in the local market? </p><p> The big market-moving news of the past week was the November US jobs data that showed unemployment falling to 3.7 per cent. This came just days ahead of the Fed's rate-setting meeting this week. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield edged up slightly to 4.24 per cent by the close on Dec 8.</p><p> While some fear that the tightening jobs market could prompt the Fed to rethink the pace of monetary easing, many economists also welcomed it as a sign that the US economy remained robust, with no imminent signs of a recession.</p><p> As we get into the final three weeks of the year, all eyes (and ears) will be on the messages coming out of the United States, and, in particular, the Fed.</p><p> Many economists expect that with inflation pulling back from around 9 per cent in 2022 to about 3 per cent now, the US central bank will cut rates in 2024. But by how much'</p><p> More optimistic market experts, like ING's chief international economist James Knightley, reckon the Fed could make as many as six 25-basis-point rate cuts next year, adding up to 150 basis points. He also expects the interest rate cuts to extend into 2025 with at least four 25-basis-point interest rate cuts.</p><p> If so, the Fed funds rate would fall to below 4 per cent by the end of 2024, from the 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent range now, and to below 3 per cent by the end of 2025. This could have huge implications for equity and bond markets, given that there is over US$6 trillion (S$8 trillion) in funds currently earning risk-free returns in money markets deposits. These funds would seek out higher returns if interest rates start falling.</p><p> Mr Thilan Wickramasinghe, regional head of research at Maybank Securities, reckons the market will take a big bet against the Fed. </p><p> \"The fall in treasury yields is already pricing in five interest rate cuts for next year, with the first starting as early as March,\" he noted. \"Inflation is nowhere near the Fed's target range of 2 per cent. Plus, there is nothing in its recent communications to hint that it will deviate from this target. While the momentum created by peak interest rate optimism can continue for a while, we would keep a close eye on stretched equity valuations.\"</p><p> In short, while the optimism about rate cuts and falling inflation is justified, don't get carried away. </p><p> Going into 2024, a great deal also hinges on key commodity price movements, the health of the global economy and how geopolitics plays out. That said, this could be an opportune time to start thinking of building up portfolios for 2024 and beyond.</p><p> In its 2024 Global Outlook report released last week, US financial giant BlackRock advised investors to go beyond traditional building blocks and transcend traditional asset classes. It called for focus on \"mega forces\" such as digital disruption, the growth of artificial intelligence, the future of finance, the impact of ageing populations and the push towards climate resilience.</p><p> \"Mega forces are key drivers of the new regime, affecting the long-term growth and inflation outlook and creating shifts in profitability. We see them as a source of return now and far into the future,\" said the report prepared by its research unit, BlackRock Investment Institute.</p><p> In its recent market outlook pronouncements, Morgan Stanley said that as the Fed moves to pivot in 2024, high-quality bonds would outperform, the US dollar would remain strong during the first half, US equities would ride higher and commodities -- especially oil -- would likely remain range bound next year. It is advising clients to buy US Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds, and selectively add equities.</p><p> Within the Asia-Pacific ex-Japan, Morgan Stanley prefers Singapore, India, Mexico, Greece and Poland, while downgrading South Korea and the Middle East. </p><p> \"In Asia, we expect a recovery in semiconductors and also prefer energy and nearshoring-exposed industrials,\" Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson and team noted. \"We like financials in Japan, Singapore, India and Indonesia.\"</p><p> The best strategy would be to get back into the market gradually over the coming months, rather than try to punt or time the market. Diversification across asset classes is also important. But given the potential volatility and \"unknown unknowns\" (borrowing the words of former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld), active portfolio management is required.</p><p> In recent weeks, several banks, brokerages and investment houses have been offering advice on their Singapore stock picks for the year ahead. </p><p> Some of the names that have been repeated across some of these reports are CapitaLand Investment, ComfortDelGro, Singtel, the Singapore banks, Sembcorp Industries, Keppel Corp, Genting Singapore, Mapletree Industrial Trust, Raffles Medical, ST Engineering, Seatrium, Venture, Sats, CDL Hospitality Trusts, Far East Hospitality Trust, Food Empire, Frencken Group and Valuetronics Holdings. Another company worth watching is LHN, which will transfer from Catalist to the mainboard on Dec 13, a move which could potentially attract institutional interest.</p><p> The two biggest market-moving events of this week will be the November inflation numbers on Dec 12, with consensus at 3.1 per cent, down from October's 3.2 per cent. </p><p> On Dec 13, the Fed will meet for its December rate-setting meeting, with the market expecting it to keep its key rates unchanged for the third consecutive gathering. </p><p> Other data of interest will be US jobless claims, retail sales and manufacturing output.</p><p> Despite potential volatility, the market uptrend seems intact.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["That said, this could be an opportune time to start thinking of building up portfolios for 2024 and beyond.

Welcome to the launch of the Singapore Pavilion at COP28 in Dubai.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every COP is more important than the previous one, simply because with each passing year the world is running out of time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* According to the latest IPCC report, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, this is what is necessary to keep temperatures from rising above the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* But greenhouse gas emissions are still rising not falling.</p><p>* Average global temperatures are already 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The negotiations that take place at COP to foster new climate commitments are thus critically important. But it is out here - in Pavilions like these - where commitments are turned into action, where individual contributions coalesce into collective impact.</p><p>The Singapore Pavilion aims to serve as a platform for such collective action to catalyse climate solutions. Later today, Singapore will co-host with Bain &amp; Co the inaugural Climate Leaders' Assembly. We have convened leaders from the private and people sectors to brainstorm ideas and develop initiatives.</p><p>Singapore is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. But our contribution to climate action is not just to remove the 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions that we account for. More importantly, it is to collaborate with partners from around the world to galvanise resources and incubate and scale solutions for climate action.</p><p>And Singapore is well placed to do this.</p><p>* As an aviation and maritime hub, Singapore can play a role in developing the infrastructure and networks for promoting cleaner fuels and decarbonisation.</p><p>* As an international financial centre, Singapore can help to mobilise the financing necessary to support Asia's transition towards a low-carbon future.</p><p>* As an urban metropolis, Singapore can be a test bed for innovative solutions ranging from measures to reduce urban heat to fortifying defences against rising sea levels.</p><p>The Pavilion's programme will span these three big themes: decarbonisation, finance, and resilience.</p><p>Let me start with decarbonisation. As a major air and sea transportation hub, Singapore can play a key role in regional and global efforts to reduce emissions in the international aviation and maritime sectors.</p><p>In aviation, Singapore is taking a comprehensive approach to reducing emissions - across airport, airline, and air traffic management activities.</p><p>* We are reviewing the policies and support required for the adoption and production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Singapore.</p><p>* This includes exploring mechanisms to promote the offtake of SAF at Changi Airport.</p><p>* Greater use of SAF will contribute towards the International Civil Aviation Authority's goal to reduce emissions in international aviation by 5% by 2030 through use of cleaner energy.</p><p>In the maritime sector, Singapore is promoting various clean marine fuels for bunkering.</p><p>* We are doing this through pilot trials and demonstration projects for fuels like bio-LNG, methanol, and ammonia.</p><p>* The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) has been collaborating with other international ports and partners such as shipping lines, fuel suppliers, and research institutes, to promote Green and Digital Shipping Corridors.</p><p>- These Corridors support the transition to zero- and near-zero-emission fuels by building up the necessary supply, infrastructure, and regulations.</p><p>- MPA currently has two active corridors, with the Port of Rotterdam as well as the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach.</p><p>* We look forward to sharing some of our learnings from these initiatives later this week at this Pavilion.</p><p>Next, finance.</p><p>Some US$3 trillion of financing is needed each year for the Asia-Pacific region to reach net zero by 2050.</p><p>As a leading international financial centre, Singapore can play an important role in mobilising this capital. Our blueprint for doing this is the Finance for Net Zero Action Plan launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in partnership with the financial industry. Its aim is to mobilise finance to catalyse Asia's net zero transition.</p><p>The effort will require much innovation and collaboration. In the coming days, you will hear of two financing mechanisms that can play a key role in supporting decarbonisation solutions, particularly those which are marginally bankable or uneconomical today.</p><p>The first is blended finance.</p><p>* Blended finance is about bringing together various partners from the public and private sectors to contribute in different and synergistic ways to make green and transition projects bankable.</p><p>* Concessionary capital, coupled with technical assistance and regulatory certainty, can help to reduce risks and crowd-in multiples of commercial capital.</p><p>Second, carbon credits.</p><p>* Carbon credits generated from the verifiable reduction of emissions can improve the economic case for many transition projects.</p><p>* MAS has published a working paper with McKinsey that outlines how high-integrity carbon credits can be generated from future emissions reduction due to the early retirement of coal-generated power and replacement with cleaner energy sources.</p><p>* Such transition credits can potentially enable a broader market-driven financing mechanism and help to crowd-in private capital at scale.</p><p>We will be sharing concrete initiatives on scaling these financing mechanisms and announcing new partnerships to take them forward.</p><p>Finally, resilience.</p><p>With long coastlines and heavily populated low-lying areas, Southeast Asia is one of the world's most vulnerable regions to extreme weather and rising sea levels.</p><p>Singapore can play a useful role in pioneering and scaling urban solutions to build climate resilience.

V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6)[2].<br/><br/>2. V3 updates Singapore's national climate change projections from the previous study (V2) released by CCRS in 2015. Based on a carefully selected set of global climate models from IPCC AR6, V3 downscales[3] the projections to higher resolutions of 8km over Southeast Asia and 2km over Singapore using CCRS' customised Regional Climate Model. Compared to V2, the V3 projections incorporate improved representations and a wider range of physical processes in the global climate system, enabling more accurate simulation of our regional climate on a finer scale.<br/><br/>3. V3 uses three projected global socio-economic pathways affecting greenhouse gas emission levels to explore the possible range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by end century. These correspond to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)[4] used in the IPCC AR6. The low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) reflects a shift to sustainable development pathways with net zero targets achieved after 2050 while the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) is driven by energy intensive, fossil fuel-based development. The medium emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) takes a middle-of-the-road pathway where historical patterns of development continue throughout this century.<br/><br/>Very Hot Days and Warm Nights the New Normal by End Century<br/><br/>4. Consistent with earlier projections, Singapore is expected to become warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius by end century. Singapore's annual mean temperatures, which increased at a rate of 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade in the past 40 years, is projected to rise to 0.55 degrees Celsius per decade by end century under the high emissions scenario.<br/><br/>5. Very hot days will become more frequent. Singapore experienced daily maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius[5] 21.4 days per year on average in the last 40 years. By end century, we will see between 41 and 351 days per year on average of such high daily maximum temperatures. More warm nights where temperatures exceed 26.3 degrees Celsius are also projected. From an average of 76 nights per year in the last 40 years, Singapore could experience such warm nights most nights in the year by end century.<br/><br/>Rainfall Extremes to Intensify, Dry Periods to Get Drier<br/><br/>6. Singapore's rainfall is highly variable at seasonal time scales. By the end of century, total rainfall during the southwest monsoon dry season of June-through-August could fall significantly below the historical low of 314 mm (recorded in 1997) around once every three years. For the northeast monsoon wet season of November-through-January, the corresponding seasonal total rainfall is projected to exceed the historical high of 1507 mm (recorded in 2006) occasionally.<br/><br/>7. Extreme daily rainfall[6] is projected to increase across all seasons, with increases ranging from around 6 to 92 per cent in the inter-monsoon months of April and May. On the other hand, dry spells[7] could be more frequent and last longer, with Singapore experiencing on average one dry spell every 10 to 60 months by end of century.<br/><br/>Mean Sea Level to Rise<br/><br/>8. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario. This increase from the previous V2 projections (around 1m by end century) is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels.<br/><br/>Staying Resilient in The Face of Climate Change<br/><br/>9. Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. Singapore is doing our part, with the Singapore Green Plan. We are committed to reach net-zero carbon by 2050.<br/><br/>10. In addition, the Government takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change. The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate resilient. Details of the Government's current climate adaptation efforts can be found in Annex B(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/latest-climate-projections-for-singapore-show-intensifying-urban-heat-and-more-wet-dry-extremes\">https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/latest-climate-projections-for-singapore-show-intensifying-urban-heat-and-more-wet-dry-extremes</url>).<br/><br/>11.MSS will also be sharing the V3 data with ASEAN Member States at a later stage. In addition, MSS will be collaborating with international entities and the wider scientific community to undertake joint research using V3 data.<br/><br/>12. To deepen our understanding of the impacts of climate change, NEA today also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impacts Science Research (CISR) Programme[8] for new research proposals on food security, impacts on human health, water resources, sea level rise and impacts on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector. In December last year, eight projects were awarded under the Programme's first grant call. These projects will make use of V3 results to look into areas like the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore, changes in our tropical forest landscape, among others.<br/><br/>13.

The pop-up awards ceremony was held daily from Dec 3 to 12. These were the first three \"winners\" of this dubious honour at COP28, given out on Dec 3:</p><p> 1st place: New Zealand  For announcing new plans to reopen the Aotearoa waters -- the sea around New Zealand -- for oil and gas exploration, New Zealand received first place for undermining a decade-long battle by indigenous people to keep these marine waters free from such endeavours. </p><p> \"New Zealand had been saying all the right things, listening to Indigenous voices, and championing a global phase-out of fossil fuels. </p><p> \"But with a new government in the driver's seat, they seem to have swerved off course and are undermining the Indigenous People-led struggle,\" said the NGO, referring to the country's centre-right National Party, which came to power in November.</p><p> 2nd place: JapanJapan's plans to extend the lifespan of fossil fuels by promoting their use with hydrogen and ammonia drew flak for greenwashing from Climate Action Network. </p><p> \"Japan's Prime Minister has been making a sales pitch through the Asia Zero Emissions Community initiative for South-east Asia to keep their coal and gas plants running using the hydrogen and ammonia co-firing technology.</p><p> \"This push to lock in fossil fuel-based energy across the continent is delaying the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, adding hurdles to achieving the global goal of tripling renewables,\" it added.</p><p> 3rd place: United States  The US came under fire for its priorities when it came to climate finance, after it pledged only US$17.5 million (S$23.5 million) to the loss and damage fund adopted at COP28. The fund will see developed countries, which are largely responsible for climate change, pay compensation to developing ones. More than US$790 million has been pledged so far. </p><p> \"We award this fossil for the US to look in the mirror and reflect on its allocation of funds,\" said Climate Action Network. </p><p> It called America's pledge paltry for the size of the country's historical emissions, and even more so compared with its military spending, with US$38 billion allocated to military aid to Israel, for instance. </p><p>US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, however, said at a press conference on Dec 6 that the figure was a starting point and the amount given could be subject to change in the future. </p><p> 5.

This was the first time they met after Mr Sunak became the UK prime minister last October.Describing both nation's relationship as \"dynamic\" and \"comprehensive\" at all levels including trade and investment, defence and security, and science and technology, both leaders said in the joint declaration that mutual cooperation between the two countries reflected the \"like-minded\" and \"forward-looking\" nature of Singapore and the UK.This includes an unwavering commitment to free trade, international law and the rules-based multilateral system, as well as a shared commitment to peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific, said the declaration.\"This Joint Declaration on the Strategic Partnership heralds a new era in Singapore-United Kingdom relations, catalysing opportunities for our people to cooperate and strengthen linkages, for the common peace, stability and prosperity of our countries,\" both leaders said.WHY IT MATTERSThe latest \"strategic partnership\" upgrades the already strong bilateral relations between Singapore and the UK in more areas and comes after UK's accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in July.Singapore is one of the members of the CPTPP, a free trade agreement among 11 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation that was concluded in 2018.Previously, both countries had announced a \"Partnership for the Future\" in 2019 that covered four broad areas of cooperation, namely the digital economy, sustainable business and innovation, security and defence, as well as in education, culture and youth exchanges.Since then, the UK-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (UKSFTA) came into force in 2021, as well as the UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement (UKSDEA) in 2022, further enhancing economic cooperation between both nations.In terms of military cooperation, both nations are part of the Five Power Defence Agreement (FPDA) dating back to 1971, and which includes Australia, Malaysia and New Zealand. </p><p>Singapore and the UK also signed a Defence Cooperation Memorandum of Understanding in 2018 at the sidelines of the annual Shangri-La Dialogue -the first MOU on defencebetween the two countries.WHAT DOES THE NEW STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP INCLUDE?ECONOMICBoth Mr Lee and Mr Sunak recognised that the security of both countries is built upon prosperity, and as such, \"will commit to deepening our economic relationship to strengthen the dynamism and resilience of our economies\", the joint declaration said.  To this end, both countries will seek to \"maximise the benefits and opportunities\" from the UKSFTA, UKSDEA as well as the UK's accession to the CPTPP. In general, all three trade and digital economy treaties promote tariff-free trade, lowers barriers to entry and facilitate market access between businesses of both countries.  Among other things, the declaration also states that Singapore and UK will commit to explore mechanisms to facilitate cross-border data flows, promote the adoption of \"interoperable digital systems through multilateral fora\".  The primary platform to monitor progress of such cooperation will be through an annual UK-Singapore Financial Dialogue, the joint declaration stated.  Singapore and Britain will also work together to scale green and transition finance, which will include \"bilateral pilot projects that support innovation and resilience\" in the financial systems of both economies, said both leaders.DEFENCE, FOREIGN POLICYBoth leaders pledged to contribute towards a free, stable and peaceful international rules-based order.  Singapore and the UK will expand their and reaffirm existing defence cooperations, such as the FPDA and the 2018 MOU on Defence Cooperation, the joint declaration stated.  Both countries will also deepen partnerships between their defence ministries, including in managing of threats in the digital and cyber domains.  Other areas in which Singapore and the UK will strengthen cooperation include dealing with maritime security issues and \"tackling of shared threats from illicit finance, economic and organised crimes\".SUSTAINABILITYMr Lee and Mr Sunak said the partnership between both countries will help to develop a green economy that achieves the goals of the Paris Agreement and Glasgow Climate Pact, besides strengthening climate resilience and create new jobs in growth sectors.  Singapore and the UK will reaffirm their commitment to multilateral environment agreements global climate action goals, such as to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.  Both nations will also contribute towards a sustainable economy by accelerating \"regional sustainable infrastructure and investment\" and developing the relevant talent pool and skillsets through a Green Skills Corridor.The joint declaration on Saturday stated that the foreign ministries of Singapore and the UK will \"regularly review\" progress in the implementation of the Strategic Partnership to ensure that the cooperation continues to be \"relevant and future ready\".</p>", "publisher": "Today (Singapore) - Online", "instances": ["Both countries will also deepen partnerships between their defence ministries, including in managing of threats in the digital and cyber domains.

Important as these are, however, organisations ranging from McKinsey to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have highlighted that these massive projects don't -- inevitably -- have to be competitive.</p><p> The ADB, for instance, sees a regional infrastructure investment gap of some US$26 trillion in that area of the globe alone in the period to 2030. </p><p> To put this into perspective, even if China were to double the BRI's investment total in this period, it would still leave financial capacity for many multiples of the EU's Global Gateway scheme. The European effort aims to mobilise up to 300 billion euros (S$434.7 billion) in public and private global investments in the period from 2021 to 2027.</p><p> Yet, despite these core facts, the primary lens through which the BRI and Global Gateway are often perceived is geopolitical. While the BRI has garnered massive media coverage over the last decade, Global Gateway has operated far more under the global radar screen, despite being widely seen as Europe's most significant response to BRI to date. </p><p> Outward lookingGlobal Gateway is politically led in Brussels, but it aims to mobilise up to 300 billion euros in public and private funds by 2027 to finance EU infrastructure projects abroad. This total is based on national and EU resources from financial institutions and development banks, in the hope that institutional spending will unlock significant private capital too.</p><p> The role of the private sector is cemented in the EU scheme by the business advisory board which includes a wide range of firms, including in the energy, transport and digital sectors. </p><p> They are: AEE Power, ANDRITZ Hydro, EDL, Enel Group, Eramet, Getra Group, Iberdrola, Siemens, TotalEnergies, Turbulent, Veolia, Vestas Wind Systems, Aktors, Asseco Data Systems, ESET, Eutelsat, MIM Solutions, Nokia Digital, Orange Digital, PAIX Data Centres, Telecom Italia, Telefonica, Bayer, Merck, Royal Philips, Allianz, Danone, AP Moeller Maersk, Alstom, Deutsche Post, DHL Group, and Volvo Group.</p><p> Geographically, the project is focused on Latin America and the Caribbean; the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific; and Africa. These target regions broadly align with the EU's goal of diversifying its supply chains given the high dependence on several key countries, including China. </p><p> At Wednesday's launch in Brussels, political leaders from more than a dozen developing nations attended, including Armenia, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Egypt and Georgia.</p><p> While projects in Africa and Latin America have already been given significant media attention, what are perhaps less known are those in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. Given the intensifying geopolitical competition in these regions, the EU is stepping up its strategic engagement there too. The growing economic, demographic and political weight of these areas makes them key collaborators in shaping the rules-based international order and in addressing key global challenges such as climate change.</p><p> Projects in Asia include an Asean Team Europe Initiative on Sustainable Connectivity, which would support Asean electric grid interconnections to improve access to renewable energy, invest in digitalisation, including in connectivity via submarine cables, as well as promote environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable value chains. </p><p> There is also a Green Team Europe Initiative with Asean, to strengthen the EU's partnership with the region in areas such as environmental and biodiversity protection, clean energy transition, disaster resilience, prevention of illegal logging, wildlife trafficking, and air pollution.</p><p> In the Middle East, meanwhile, possible projects include a water desalination scheme in Jordan for enhancing water security in a nation increasingly hit by the impact of global warming. There is also a potential digital project for businesses and universities in Egypt, plus several neighbouring nations to boost Internet speeds via a submarine optical cable.</p><p> Beyond these examples, Global Gateway's areas of focus include climate and energy with investment in both mitigation and climate resilience, as well as in clean energy, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Key goals with this include helping deliver energy security, alongside global objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement climate goals.</p><p> Another Global Gateway area of focus is health, with a goal of strengthening capacity around the world. This will prioritise security of pharmaceutical supply chains and development of local manufacturing. The Covid pandemic revealed weaknesses of healthcare systems and the fragility of pharmaceutical supply chains. It also highlighted the wide discrepancy in medical manufacturing capacities around the world.</p><p> Driving changeYet another example is transport, with a goal of creating sustainable, smart, resilient, inclusive and safe transport networks, including in Africa. There, the goal is to help enable the economic potential of an African continental trade area.</p><p> Creating such strategic, sustainable, and secure transport corridors and supporting value chains, services and jobs will benefit industries in both Africa and Europe. The proposed strategic corridors through reliable networks and services will provide better, greener EU-Africa connectivity. These corridors will facilitate trade and mobility within Africa, as well as between Africa and Europe.</p><p> One of these transport networks that the EU, alongside the US, is keen to develop is the Trans-African Corridor. Angola, Zambia and the DRC -- all home to major deposits of cobalt, lithium and copper -- had in July committed to the project, which will connect the mineral-rich Katanga province in the DRC to the Atlantic port of Lobito in Angola, through the copper belt in Zambia.</p><p> At the G20 summit in India in September, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the goal of the Trans-African Corridor is \"not only to connect a landlocked region to the sea\". The partnership \"will also invest in local value chains, in clean energy and in skills for the local workforce. It is a whole new approach to large infrastructure investment.

Important as these are, however, organisations ranging from McKinsey to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have highlighted that these massive projects don't - inevitably - have to be competitive.The ADB, for instance, sees a regional infrastructure investment gap of some US$26 trillion in that area of the globe alone in the period to 2030. To put this into perspective, even if China were to double the BRI's investment total in this period, it would still leave financial capacity for many multiples of the EU's Global Gateway scheme. The European effort aims to mobilise up to 300 billion euros (S$434.7 billion) in public and private global investments in the period from 2021 to 2027.Yet, despite these core facts, the primary lens through which the BRI and Global Gateway are often perceived is geopolitical. While the BRI has garnered massive media coverage over the last decade, Global Gateway has operated far more under the global radar screen, despite being widely seen as Europe's most significant response to BRI to date. </p><p>Global Gateway is politically led in Brussels, but it aims to mobilise up to 300 billion euros in public and private funds by 2027 to finance EU infrastructure projects abroad. This total is based on national and EU resources from financial institutions and development banks, in the hope that institutional spending will unlock significant private capital too.The role of the private sector is cemented in the EU scheme by the business advisory board which includes a wide range of firms, including in the energy, transport and digital sectors. They are: AEE Power, ANDRITZ Hydro, EDL, Enel Group, Eramet, Getra Group, Iberdrola, Siemens, TotalEnergies, Turbulent, Veolia, Vestas Wind Systems, Aktors, Asseco Data Systems, ESET, Eutelsat, MIM Solutions, Nokia Digital, Orange Digital, PAIX Data Centres, Telecom Italia, Telefonica, Bayer, Merck, Royal Philips, Allianz, Danone, AP Moeller Maersk, Alstom, Deutsche Post, DHL Group, and Volvo Group.Geographically, the project is focused on Latin America and the Caribbean; the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific; and Africa. These target regions broadly align with the EU's goal of diversifying its supply chains given the high dependence on several key countries, including China. At Wednesday's launch in Brussels, political leaders from more than a dozen developing nations attended, including Armenia, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Egypt and Georgia.While projects in Africa and Latin America have already been given significant media attention, what are perhaps less known are those in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. Given the intensifying geopolitical competition in these regions, the EU is stepping up its strategic engagement there too. The growing economic, demographic and political weight of these areas makes them key collaborators in shaping the rules-based international order and in addressing key global challenges such as climate change.Projects in Asia include an Asean Team Europe Initiative on Sustainable Connectivity, which would support Asean electric grid interconnections to improve access to renewable energy, invest in digitalisation, including in connectivity via submarine cables, as well as promote environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable value chains. There is also a Green Team Europe Initiative with Asean, to strengthen the EU's partnership with the region in areas such as environmental and biodiversity protection, clean energy transition, disaster resilience, prevention of illegal logging, wildlife trafficking, and air pollution.In the Middle East, meanwhile, possible projects include a water desalination scheme in Jordan for enhancing water security in a nation increasingly hit by the impact of global warming. There is also a potential digital project for businesses and universities in Egypt, plus several neighbouring nations to boost Internet speeds via a submarine optical cable.Beyond these examples, Global Gateway's areas of focus include climate and energy with investment in both mitigation and climate resilience, as well as in clean energy, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Key goals with this include helping deliver energy security, alongside global objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement climate goals.Another Global Gateway area of focus is health, with a goal of strengthening capacity around the world. This will prioritise security of pharmaceutical supply chains and development of local manufacturing. The Covid pandemic revealed weaknesses of healthcare systems and the fragility of pharmaceutical supply chains. It also highlighted the wide discrepancy in medical manufacturing capacities around the world.Yet another example is transport, with a goal of creating sustainable, smart, resilient, inclusive and safe transport networks, including in Africa. There, the goal is to help enable the economic potential of an African continental trade area.Creating such strategic, sustainable, and secure transport corridors and supporting value chains, services and jobs will benefit industries in both Africa and Europe. The proposed strategic corridors through reliable networks and services will provide better, greener EU-Africa connectivity. These corridors will facilitate trade and mobility within Africa, as well as between Africa and Europe.One of these transport networks that the EU, alongside the US, is keen to develop is the Trans-African Corridor. Angola, Zambia and the DRC - all home to major deposits of cobalt, lithium and copper - had in July committed to the project, which will connect the mineral-rich Katanga province in the DRC to the Atlantic port of Lobito in Angola, through the copper belt in Zambia.At the G20 summit in India in September, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the goal of the Trans-African Corridor is \"not only to connect a landlocked region to the sea\". The partnership \"will also invest in local value chains, in clean energy and in skills for the local workforce. It is a whole new approach to large infrastructure investment. It is about shared prosperity. It is about real benefits for all partners\", she said.Taken together, the launch of the new Global Gateway strategy is only the latest signal of a new, geopolitical EU. While the project so far has much fewer resources than BRI, it nonetheless signals a step change in the EU's approach to try to protect its political, economic and security interests, and project a strong and competitive bloc to the outside world.The writer is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["In the Middle East, meanwhile, possible projects include a water desalination scheme in Jordan for enhancing water security in a nation increasingly hit by the impact of global warming.

The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), under the Meteorological ServiceSingapore, has released the findings of the Third National Climate<br/><br/>Change Study (V3[1]) today. V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6)[2].</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. V3 updates Singapore's national climate change projections from the previous study (V2) released by CCRS in 2015. Based on a carefully selected set of global climate models from IPCC AR6, V3 downscales[3] the projections to higher resolutions of 8km over Southeast Asia and 2km over Singapore using CCRS' customised Regional Climate Model. Compared to V2, the V3 projections incorporate improved representations and a wider range of physical processes in the global climate system, enabling more accurate simulation of our regional climate on a finer scale.</p><p>3. V3 uses three projected global socio-economic pathways affecting greenhouse gasemission levels to explore the possible range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by end century. These correspond to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)[4] used in the IPCC AR6. The low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) reflects a shift to sustainable development pathways with net zero targets achieved after 2050 while the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) is driven by energy intensive, fossil fuel-based development. The medium emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) takes a middle-of-the-road pathway where historical patterns of development continue throughout this century.</p><p>Very Hot Days and Warm Nights the New Normal by End Century</p><p>4. Consistent with earlier projections, Singapore is expected to become warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius by end century. Singapore's annual mean temperatures, which increased at a rate of 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade in the past 40 years, is projected to rise to 0.55 degrees Celsius per decade by end century under the high emissions scenario.</p><p>5. Very hot days will become more frequent. Singapore experienced daily maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius[5] 21.4 days per year on average in the last 40 years. By end century, we will see between 41 and 351 days per year on average of such high daily maximum temperatures. More warm nights where temperatures exceed 26.3 degrees Celsius are also projected. From an average of 76 nights per year in the last 40 years,<br/><br/>Singapore could experience such warm nights most nights in the year by end century. Rainfall Extremes to Intensify, Dry Periods to Get Drier</p><p>6. Singapore's rainfall is highly variable at seasonal time scales. By the end of century, total rainfall during the southwest monsoon dry season of June-through-August could fallsignificantly below the historical low of 314 mm (recorded in 1997) around once every threeyears. For the northeast monsoon wet season of November-through-January, the corresponding seasonal total rainfall is projected to exceed the historical high of 1507 mm (recorded in 2006) occasionally.</p><p>7. Extreme daily rainfall[6] is projected to increase across all seasons, with increases ranging from around 6 to 92 per cent in the inter-monsoon months of April and May. On the other hand, dry spells[7] could be more frequent and last longer, with Singapore experiencing<br/><br/>on average one dry spell every 10 to 60 months by end of century.<br/><br/>Mean Sea Level to Rise</p><p>8. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario. This increase from the previous V2 projections (around 1m by end century) is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels Staying Resilient in The Face of Climate Change</p><p>9. Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. Singapore is doing our part, with the Singapore Green Plan. We are committed to reach net-zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>10. In addition, the Government takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change. The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate resilient.

MSS will also be sharing the V3 data with ASEAN Member States at a later stage. In addition, MSS will be collaborating with international entities and the wider scientific community to undertake joint research using V3 data.</p><p>12. To deepen our understanding of the impacts of climate change, NEA today also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impacts Science Research (CISR)Programme[8] for new research proposals on food security, impacts on human health, water resources, sea level rise and impacts on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector. In December last year, eight projects were awarded under the Programme's first grant call. These projects will make use of V3 results to look into areas like the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore, changes in our tropical forest landscape, among others.</p><p>13.

The private sector has also become involved.But many more companies need to play a much more active role in cutting pollution, construction of dams, water reclamation, sewage plants and other infrastructure. New technology and research are also urgently needed to create new water sources.This is not a recommendation for the privatisation of water companies. The UK privatisation model has been inefficient, costly and extremely unpopular. Inadequate investment, high levels of debt, large dividends to shareholders and excessive director payments have resulted in major water leakages and sewage being dumped into rivers and the sea.Instead, private companies should provide funding and work alongside the public sector and NGOs on a contractual or private partnership basis.\"Water does not only present us with challenges. It also presents us with a great opportunity,\" states the UN's dedicated water division. \"Water can be the dealmaker, the leverage point for a green economy, climate resilience and a more sustainable and inclusive world.\"\"Water - because of its many interlinkages - can bring together all stakeholders (individual and institutional) to forge coalitions, strengthen capacities and provide solutions to be replicated and scaled.\"Opportunities for investmentPledges made during the July conference exceeded US$330 billion, with the potential to leverage close to US$1 trillion. The private sector and civil society made most of these, according to the UN. Two-thirds of commitments came from 480 large and well-established organisations.Riding the Wave, a study of private companies working on water conservation and innovation, found more than 2,700 water-related opportunities worth an estimated US$436 billion.\"The ripple effect of water action means that acting on these opportunities is good for business, and good for the planet,\" the report said.For instance, the global water desalination market - that is, converting seawater to freshwater - is expected to grow from US$13.5 billion in 2021 to US$28.8 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.In providing access, one player is WorldServe International, with backers that include US businessman Doug Pitt and his younger brother, actor Brad Pitt. It has been drilling large-scale, deep boreholes in Tanzania, Africa. These wells provide water for some three million people, and are powered by solar panels to distribute the water for drinking, sanitation and agriculture.Innovation could bring even more opportunities to light. Source, a startup in Arizona, has reportedly raised US$130 million from investors such as Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and asset manager BlackRock.Source produces \"hydropanels\" for residents and companies. These are similar to solar panels, but also have fans that suck in moisture from the air to create clean, safe drinking water. Despite the dry desert conditions in Arizona, each panel can produce six litres of water a day, the company says.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Water does not only present us with challenges.

Oil prices remained subdued, the US labour market was tight, and consumer spending has been robust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The biggest market-moving event of 2023 was the meltdown of four US regional banks and the near-collapse of Credit Suisse, which was subsequently taken over by rival UBS. The events shook investor sentiment. There was also the spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p> Yet, global equities have risen by some 17 per cent in 2023, led by technology plays, in particular the \"Magnificent 7\" US big tech stocks comprising Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. </p><p> The MSCI Informational World Technology Index delivered a 46 per cent return in 2023, in sharp contrast to a 31 per cent dive in 2022.</p><p> The year-end Santa Rally remained largely intact, despite some scattered turbulence. The immediate outlook for equity and bond markets seems better than it has been for the last 24 months, thanks to expectations that the US Federal Reserve will stop raising rates in 2024.</p><p> With Wall Street indexes now at three-year highs, some strategists are projecting the US benchmark S&amp;P500 index to hit 5,400 points by the end of 2024, and 6,000 points by the end of 2025. It closed at 4,783.35 points on Dec 28 in New York, before this article was published.</p><p> Across the Pacific, the market rally has found stronger legs thanks to the Fed's announcement of rate cuts in 2024. The European Central Bank and others will likely follow suit.</p><p> Fed's rate cuts could boost markets, but risks aboundAt its December gathering, the Fed hinted there could be three cuts in 2024, bringing its key lending rate at midpoint between 4.50 and 4.75 per cent. That implies a 75-basis-point cut.</p><p> More optimistic market experts, like ING chief international economist James Knightley, reckon that the Fed could make as many as six 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2024, adding up to 150 basis points. He also expects the interest rate cuts to extend into 2025 with at least four 25-basis-point interest rate cuts.</p><p> This could have huge implications for equity and bond markets, given that there is some US$6 trillion (S$8 trillion) in funds currently earning risk-free returns in money market deposits. These funds would have to seek out higher returns if interest rates start falling, benefiting the equity and bond markets through much of 2024. </p><p> That said, 2024 is not going to be a trouble-free ride for the market either.</p><p> There are many uncertainties still hanging over the market: relatively tight credit conditions, heightened geopolitical risks and potential slowdown in key economies, including the US.</p><p> \"Gazing into the crystal ball for a glimpse into the outlook for 2024, it is clear that a great deal hinges on how inflation and the economy perform in the coming months,\" noted Mr Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC Bank. </p><p> S&amp;P Global Ratings noted in its report, titled Credit Cycle Indicator Q1 2024: More Pain Before A Recovery in 2025, that relatively tight credit conditions for households and companies will not start getting better until 2025. </p><p> There is also the question of how inflation recedes. A disorderly and steep fall in prices could indicate a collapse in consumer confidence, which in turn, could precipitate a recession. </p><p> Investors are pinning their hopes on a soft landing scenario for the US economy, where a period of economic expansion slows down gradually without entering a recession.</p><p> Unfortunately, history has not been on the Fed's side on this count: All but five Fed tightening cycles since 1950 have ended in a recession.</p><p> Economists and analysts are crunching out their forecasts for growth and earnings for this outcome.  </p><p> \"We expect the US growth slowdown to be more apparent in the first half of 2024 with a technical recession, but a soft landing remains possible in our base case,\" said UOB in its latest Global Economics and Market Research report.</p><p> A technical recession is a phase when an economy experiences negative economic growth over a six-month period. </p><p> UOB expects US growth to slow to 1 per cent in 2024, after a projected 2.4 per cent in 2023.</p><p> While the Fed is expected to start cutting rates by mid-2024, it takes around a year for the full effect of rate hikes that have already been done to make their way into the economy.</p><p> Meanwhile, the 18-month tightening cycle has raised the marginal funding costs for businesses over the past two years. </p><p> With cost of capital expected to remain relatively high through 2024, companies must devote a significant share of their revenue to cover higher interest expenses as they refinance their debt at higher prevailing rates. </p><p> This could impact earnings. The question is how much corporate debt needs to be rolled over at high rates and the magnitude of the impact on earnings in 2024.</p><p> Banking giant BNY Mellon expects rates to remain volatile during the first half of 2024.</p><p> One of the more sober projections comes from BCA Equity Research, whose chief strategist, Mr Peter Berezin, in his 2024 Macro Outlook, predicts that a global recession will begin in the second half of 2024, just when most investors have concluded that a soft landing has been achieved. </p><p> BCA projects the equity rally could fizzle out in early 2024.</p><p> \"Our end-2024 target for the S&amp;P 500 is 3,500. US stocks will outperform their global peers during the next recession, but not by as much as in previous downturns,\" the report noted.</p><p> This, despite Mr Berezin and his team seeing aggressive second half 2024 cuts pushing down the Fed funds rate to 2 per cent, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 3 per cent next year. </p><p> Meanwhile, the elephant in the room is geopolitics.</p><p> Analysts say that the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has compounded geopolitical concerns for investors. This comes as the world is already dealing with the fallout of the Ukraine conflict.</p><p> Traders have been buying gold and oil as a potential widening of the Middle East conflict threatens to put upside pressure on oil prices, supply chains and contribute to another round of inflation. </p><p> As Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels lob missiles at commercial ships and oil tankers in the Red Sea, a waterway which accounts for 12 per cent of global trade, the impact of ships being forced to sail around Africa could ultimately show up supply chain-related inflation.</p><p> Global equities rally could continueStill, most analysts reckon that barring other unforeseen circumstances, the rally that began in November 2023 looks likely to gather momentum and broaden.</p><p> Much of the 2023 rally has been driven by the Magnificent 7.

The MoU formalised the partnership, which is supported by C40 Cities, with the aim of establishing a GDSC connecting the three global hub ports.<br/><br/>The scope of cooperation through the Partnership Strategy and success indicators specified within build upon the MoU signed in April 2023 and reaffirm the corridor partners' commitment to drive global action to digitalise and decarbonise the shipping industry and improve efficiencies.<br/><br/>The GDSC Strategy outlines steps to accelerate decarbonisation of the maritime shipping industry by enabling first mover organisations to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the earliest feasible date, in support of the goals defined by the 2023 International Maritime Organization's Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships. The ports and C40 will work together and with value-chain stakeholders from the fuel and maritime sectors to:<br/><br/>*Coordinate decarbonisation efforts: GDSC partners will help to catalyse and coordinate efforts to enable ships calling at the Port of Singapore, Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the earliest feasible date.<br/><br/>* Build consensus on green shipping best practices: GDSC partners will seek to establish consensus around green shipping best practices and standards.<br/><br/>* Improve access to and adoption of technology and digital solutions: To enhance supply chain efficiency, resilience and decarbonisation while reducing costs and improving reliability, GDSC partners will work to develop and deploy innovative technology and digital solutions.<br/><br/>* Leverage networks: GDSC partners will work with stakeholders involved in other green shipping initiatives, including those established by the three ports and other parties, to scale the uptake of zero and near-zero emission technologies, fuels and energy sources.<br/><br/>To achieve these aims, a partnership structure and governance mechanism have been developed to provide clarity on the roles and responsibilities of GDSC partners. The strategy also outlines processes for onboarding new participants, financial management, confidentiality and decision-making.<br/><br/>As next steps, the ports and C40 have commissioned a study to analyse trade flows and vessel traffic between Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach. The study will estimate the quantity of near-zero and zero-emission fuels required for this traffic, and guide implementation by identifying opportunities for collaboration to advance the development of the GDSC.<br/><br/>The founding partners will now engage stakeholders from across the shipping and fuel supply value chains that share the GDSC's vision and aims, with the intention of onboarding new corridor participants in 2024.<br/><br/>Mr Teo Eng Dih, Chief Executive of MPA, said: \"We are excited to see this partnership grow from strength to strength with the Green and Digital Shipping Corridor Partnership Strategy. We have embarked on evaluating the various digital solutions and zero and near-zero fuels options that could be trialled along the route between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay Port Complex. We look forward to the support of all the corridor stakeholders over the coming months to conduct trials and potentially scale them for wider adoption.\"<br/><br/>\"This Partnership Strategy document is the foundation upon which we'll build the future of maritime shipping,\" Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said. \"Our success requires the resolve and dedication of the three partnering ports as well as our industry partners. Together, we will model the collaboration necessary to achieve our climate and efficiency goals.\"<br/><br/>\"Over the last two decades, we've learned that collaboration between maritime industry partners is the key to making meaningful progress in reducing emissions and cleaning the air,\"Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero said. \"This trans-Pacific green shipping corridor takes this concept global. The strategies we develop here can be used as a roadmap by a larger network of seaports and supply chain companies to invest in programs, technologies, software and infrastructure to decarbonize international trade everywhere.\"<br/><br/>C40 Executive Director Mark Watts said: \"C40 is proud to support our port partners in delivering this Partnership Strategy. The advancement of this Green and Digital Shipping Corridor brings the shipping sector one step closer to a 1.5C-aligned trajectory. Green shipping is only achievable through collaboration because no one stakeholder can afford to move unless they know others are likely to follow.

It aims to challenges in sustainability, liveability, and resilience, through the transformation of our built environment. The USS domain has its roots as early as 2006 when the Science and Technology 2010 plan was developed primarily to address our energy and water constraints. In 2015, the scope of the USS domain was expanded to address other imperatives related to the sustainability and liveability of our future city. These include food, waste, urban design and mobility, as well as climate science.</p><p>4. This year, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has partnered the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) to organise the event. This partnership underscores the growing collaboration across USS agencies and a stronger emphasis on environmental sustainability.</p><p>5. Themed \"Building Sustainable, Resilient and Liveable Cities of Tomorrow\", the Congress features more than 60 eminent speakers from various disciplines, across topics such as leveraging technology for resource circularity, climate adaptation, building cities that nurture citizens' health and well-being, and building resilience in the built environment sector through automation and digitalisation.</p><p>6. At the Congress, Minister Desmond Lee announced several key initiatives to support R&amp;D efforts within the USS domain:</p><p>a) Strategic Collaboration between URA and SUTD on urban planning research</p><p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is working with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) on a five-year strategic collaboration focusing on urban planning research. This partnership aims to enhance urban planners' decision-making processes, support them to better address emerging trends and disruptions in a fast-changing and complex environment, and uplift Singapore's competency in urban planning and design.

Even as we build up scientific knowledge through research, today's competitive landscape with shorter innovation cycles requires us to actively proliferate innovative solutions to the market for wider adoption. To achieve this, the USS domain has provided funding platforms to fast track the innovation process, such as the Built Environment Technology Alliance (BETA), Built Environment Accelerate to Market Programme (BEAMP) and the Living Lab (Water) Funding Initiative. Together with the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), we have also set up the USS Innovation &amp; Enterprise Office (USS IEO), a national platform that aims to bring more impactful technologies from lab to market for the USS domain. The USS IEO does so by facilitating technology translation in partnership with the larger innovation ecosystem, which includes research performers, industry and agencies such as IPI Singapore.</p><p>8 The Government has also cultivated public-private partnerships through initiatives such as NEA's Innovating and Curating Better Automation and Technology for Environmental Services (INCUBATE) partnership programme. The programme offers a platform for the technology providers, service providers, and progressive premises owners to co-create innovative and productive solutions, conduct trials, and scale-up implementation to address market needs.</p><p>9 As the science and technology landscape is constantly evolving, the Government will continue to provide support though various RIE initiatives to strengthen the USS ecosystem, so that we can continue to build a more sustainable, resilient, and liveable home.</p><p>Issued by: Ministry of National Development, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment</p><p>Date: 4 October 2023</p><p>ANNEX A (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow</url>) : URA-SUTD Strategic Collaboration</p><p>1. In October 2021, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) embarked on a strategic research collaboration. The 5-year cross-sector collaboration provides a sustained platform to develop R&amp;D solutions and capabilities through quick experimentation, test-bedding and implementation of joint research projects. Through this partnership, URA aims to enhance urban planners' decision-making processes, enable them to better address emerging trends and disruptions in a fast-changing and complex environment, and advance Singapore's competency in urban planning and design.</p><p>2. This is the first of several strategic research collaborations that URA has been discussing with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) in Singapore.</p><p>3. Under the URA-SUTD collaboration, faculty members including PhD students contribute their expertise and lead research projects co-developed with URA officers. URA will support the funding of these research projects and programmes over the five-year period, which will also include knowledge-exchange and capability-building programmes.</p><p>4. One ongoing research project is titled \"Computational Modelling for Optimisation of Planning and Urban Design Parameters\", led by SUTD's Asst Prof Peter Ortner in collaboration with URA's Design &amp; Planning Lab. Tapping on SUTD's expertise in computational modelling, this project aims to develop a generative design and optimisation workflow for planners to simulate and test planning scenarios within a shorter timeframe, as well as formulate development control and urban design guidelines more efficiently.</p><p>a. Since its commencement in January 2022, the project has demonstrated prototypes that can procedurally generate land parcellation and residential development scenarios as well as optimisation techniques to evaluate and shortlist generated solutions that best fit development constraints.</p><p>b. The SUTD team is also developing a proof-of-concept web application which incorporates generative design and optimisation processes with interfaces tailored to the planning workflow. When implemented, this application has the potential to facilitate more efficient work processes for planners.</p><p>c. This research project is targeted to be completed in 2025. The outcomes will be progressively integrated within URA's ePlanner, an in-house geospatial web application that currently serves over 1,000 planners across 40 public agencies.</p><p>5. The URA-SUTD collaboration has demonstrated the benefits of adopting an inter-disciplinary approach to tackle challenges in urban planning. For instance, the use of mathematical algorithms for land parcel generation and optimising urban forms has introduced opportunities for productivity gains as well as new planning insights. As the Whole-of-Government Urban Planning &amp; Design Technology Centre of Excellence (URBEX), URA will continue to partner IHLs and research institutes to translate research outcomes into user-friendly tools that can improve the work of planning agencies across the government.</p><p>ANNEX B (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):</url> Media Factsheet</p><p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE CENTRE FOR LIVEABLE CITIES AND SINGAPORE-ETH CENTRE IN KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND CAPABILITY BUILDING</p><p>1. The Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC) and the Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) dedicated to knowledge sharing and capability building. The MoU was inked at the Urban Solutions &amp; Sustainability R&amp;D Congress, held in Singapore, on 4 October 2023.</p><p>2. The SEC is a collaboration between the National Research Foundation, Singapore, and ETH Zurich, Switzerland, as part of the CREATE International collaboratory platform. CLC is a global knowledge centre for liveable and sustainable cities set up with the primary objective of addressing emerging urban challenges.</p><p>3. The MoU was signed by CLC's Managing Director, CLC Ltd, Hugh Lim and Vice President for Research, ETH Zurich, Prof Dr Christian Wolfrum, as co-chair of the SEC's Governing Board. The signing was witnessed by Minister for National Development, Desmond Lee.</p><p>Objectives of the MoU</p><p>3. This MoU will help both parties to establish deeper collaborations for capability building on the application of the Science of Cities in the urban planning and governance domain. It will enable both parties to share knowledge, experience, tools, and methodologies on platforms such as at the biennial World Cities Summit, Science of Cities Symposium, and other workshops and conferences. Furthermore, agencies in the MND family and partners of ETH Zurich and SEC will be able to leverage each other's academic and professional networks to connect with experts globally and tap on subject matter experts to create and share new knowledge on the Science of Cities approach to support liveable and sustainable cities.</p><p>4 The scope of the MOU includes:</p><p>a.

The proper management of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) is aligned to the global drive towards circular economy, which contributes to the fight against climate change. E-waste recycling creates \"urban mining\" opportunities to recapture precious and critical metals that could replace primary raw materials such as gold, platinum, lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel. Singapore can play our part in the green economy in recovering critical, precious, and rare earth metals from e-waste to generate economic returns while enhancing the resilience of critical resources.</p><p>2. Through the Closing the Resource Loop (CTRL) Funding Initiative in RIE2025, NEA has pledged $17 million to support the NTU Singapore-CEA Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE) to research on developing cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions for recycling e-waste.</p><p>3. This fund enables SCARCE to build on the promising findings of their Phase 1 research (conducted from 2018-2023). The focus of Phase 2 is to integrate the developed processes into closed loop resource recovery solutions for test bedding, leading to their adoption at an industrial scale. SCARCE will also embark on new and innovative research areas, such as recycling of lithium-ion batteries, smart sorting and mechanochemical methods into achieving better material recovery yield.</p><p>4.

Under the first RIE2025 Grant Call of Cities of Tomorrow's City in Nature research pillar, the National Parks Board (NParks) is awarding its first project to the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The project would kickstart the long-term monitoring of key ecosystem processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling within our forests and urban green spaces. This $1.82m project will be led by researchers from the Asian School of the Environment (NTU), over a 3-year period.</p><p>2. Plants take in and release nutrients throughout their growth and decomposition, and nutrient flows can serve as indicators of ecosystem health. This project aims to establish baseline rates of nutrient release from leaf litter and soil in Singapore's forests and urban green spaces, and to develop a protocol for continued long-term monitoring. This is key for understanding patterns of nutrient flows across different natural and urban landscapes, and detecting fluctuations due to weather, climate, and urbanisation.</p><p>3. Data from this project will enable predictive modelling of nutrient cycling rates under different environmental conditions and landscape management practices. These insights can then inform the enhancement of existing urban greenery management strategies to optimise urban nutrient cycles for improved climate resilience and ecosystem health. By contributing towards the long-term monitoring of ecosystem health, the project will guide our overall City in Nature efforts to conserve and extend our natural capital, and further integrate nature into the urban environment.</p><p>About Cities of Tomorrow's City in Nature research pillar</p><p>As one of the five key pillars under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the City in Nature vision aims to further restore and integrate nature into Singapore's urban fabric, so as to strengthen our distinctiveness as a highly liveable city, while mitigating the impacts of urbanisation and adapting to climate change.

The bad news is that it is still quite high,\" he adds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global headline inflation averaged 5.6% in 4Q2022, compared to 6% in 3Q2022 - this has occurred in line with the sharp fall in food, energy and logistical costs. Nonetheless, inflation remains well above the average of 2.5% seen in the decade before Covid-19, from 2010 to 2019. However, expectations by some market participants that central banks may start easing are \"excessively optimistic\", says Menon.</p><p>\"Forward guidance by the advanced economies' central banks indicates further tightening to core inflation. Both the Fed and the ECB [European Central Bank] have reiterated their commitment to achieve their inflation targets of 2%. The key challenge facing most central banks, including MAS, is to secure a return to low inflation without incurring too large a cost to economic growth and in some cases to financial stability.</p><p>\"Thus far, the disinflation process has taken place in an orderly fashion, without much dislocation to the functioning of the global economy or financial markets. But continuing to get this balance right will be a challenge, especially if inflation gets stuck at too high a level,\" he adds.</p><p>That said, how fast core inflation can return to the central banks' target bands is contingent not just on monetary policy, Menon notes. The speed of disinflation is subject to three near-term uncertainties - labour market dynamics, China's reopening and the surge in food and energy prices.</p><p>Against this backdrop, investors will need to consider building greater resilience in their portfolios, says Menon. \"All said and done, inflation will eventually come down and interest rates normalise, though both are likely to be slightly higher than what we have been used to,\" he adds.</p><p>Effects to receding globalisation</p><p>Over the medium term, the key driver of returns and risks in the financial markets will be the effects of geoeconomic fragmentation. Rising tensions between the US and China have led to higher trade barriers, tighter cross-border investment restrictions and greater domestic production of critical goods deemed to be of strategic national importance.</p><p>On the trade front, slightly more than 60% of the trade between the US and China is subject to tariffs, notes Menon. The investment flows between the two economic giants have slowed amid tighter regulations by the US to safeguard national security and supply chains, while both countries have stepped up domestic industrial policies.</p><p>China has committed US$1.4 trillion ($1.9 trillion) over the next five years to augment domestic technology and digital infrastructure. Meanwhile, the US has passed the US$280 billion Chips Act to boost the semiconductor research and production capabilities in the US for the next 10 years.</p><p>Aside from reducing trade and investment, these measures have also reshaped broader shifts in global trade patterns and supply chains - most evidently in the electronics industry. The US' share in China's electronic exports fell by four percentage points between 2017 and 2021, while regional economies such as Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand gained market share.</p><p>Looking ahead, increased domestic capacity for electronics production in both China and the US will likely lead to a substitution of imports, says Menon. The US has proposed a Chip 4 Alliance with Taiwan, South Korea and Japan for semiconductor production, which could potentially divert trade flows away from countries that are not part of the arrangement.</p><p>\"The result of the geoeconomics fragmentation is most likely slower economic growth. Several studies show that the long-term effects of receding globalisation are costly,\" says Menon.</p><p>Citing an International Monetary Fund study, a scenario of limited trade fragmentation could reduce global GDP by 1.2%. Meanwhile, a World Trade Organization study found that under a more adverse scenario of a full technological decoupling from 2020 to 2040, the loss in GDP will be 8% to 12% in individual countries.</p><p>\"Fragmentation in the real economy will also have an impact on capital flows and financial markets. Geoeconomics fragmentation elevates financial market risk and disruption as capital flows become more regionalised and less global. Consequently, this reduces market liquidity and returns, and increases market volatility.</p><p>\"The impact of disruptions of cross-border capital flows again falls disproportionately on the less developed countries. No country will emerge unscathed amid rising geoeconomics fragmentation, with emerging market economies set to bear the brunt of reduced trade and capital mobility,\" warns Menon.</p><p>Building climate resilience</p><p>Climate change is possibly one of the most significant financial risks for investors over the long term, says Menon. This risk can materialise in two ways - first is the physical risks from climate change itself, which includes physical damage to properties and assets, disruption to supply chains, production stoppages and reduced agricultural yields which will reduce growth and push prices higher.</p><p>This is followed by transition risk, which comes from government policies, technological advances and shifts in demand patterns aimed at mitigating climate change and promoting sustainability. An example is the introduction of carbon pricing, which will change the earnings profiles of businesses, favouring firms within industries with cleaner technologies and lower carbon emissions, relative to more carbon-intensive firms and industries.</p><p>The effects of climate change on the global economy and asset markets are hard to predict, says Menon. There are inherent uncertainties in modelling climate outcomes and assessing its impact on the global economy. This is due to the limited historical data, potential non-linearities and tipping points in climate systems as well as the long horizons over which climate change materialises.</p><p>Hence, asset managers will need to build climate resilience into their portfolios, Menon highlights. They need to consider how climate change could affect the businesses that their portfolio is invested in; which firms within the portfolio have not made credible efforts to decarbonise their operations; as well as the investments that run the risk of being stranded assets in a net-zero world.</p><p>There have been significant policy moves on the sustainability front that will attract very keen invested interest in the years to come, notes Menon. In the US, the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act will direct nearly US$400 billion in federal funding to incentivise low-carbon investments in areas such as clean energy generation and storage; electrical vehicle manufacturing; and carbon capture. In Europe, meanwhile, the REPowerEU act will mobilise up to EUR300 billion ($572.9 billion) of investment in areas such as renewable energy storage and energy efficiency to achieve the 2030 target of a renewable share of 45% in energy production.</p><p>There are also significant opportunities for sustainable investing in Asia. According to McKinsey's estimates, net zero by 2050 would require about US$9.2 trillion of investment per year, out of which about a third would be in the Asia Pacific.</p><p>\"Southeast Asia has high potential for climate action. Estimates from Bain &amp; Co show that five sectors - renewable energy, electric vehicles, forest conservation, built environment and sustainable farming - account for 60% of Southeast Asia's carbon abatement potential. For example, renewables such as solar and wind will reach an annual US$30 billion opportunity by 2030 while electric mobility will get an annual $50 billion opportunity by the same period,\" says Menon.</p><p>To meet these needs, blended financing should be catalysed, he adds. Catalytic or concessional capital from multilateral banks, public and philanthropic sources is also needed to improve project bankability and crowd-in private sector capital.</p><p>\"We need to also strengthen the financial ecosystem to deploy blended finance at scale. This involves looking beyond the financing of individual projects and moving to a portfolio approach where concentration risks can be reduced through a diversified pool of assets,\" Menon concludes.</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Singapore", "instances": ["The impact of disruptions of cross-border capital flows again falls disproportionately on the less developed countries.

While a multitude of companies have been publishing net-zero targets - which is a good first step, as they did not even exist a year ago - what will now drive progress is the pace of implementation.</p><p> \"Businesses need to walk the talk in addressing climate change, executing on their public commitments.\"</p><p> Aubertin-Noel pointed out that funding is available - US$130 trillion of assets, which the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) has committed to being net zero by 2050 - while efforts are being made to harmonise global reporting standards for environment, social and governance (ESG)-related disclosures, which will bring transparency into what has traditionally been an opaque market.</p><p> \"So the challenge is now execution. Given the mounting pressure from all stakeholders - including regulators - ESG measurement is undeniably a top priority for all companies, and has moved from a CSR (corporate social responsibility) topic to a CEO (chief executive officer) agenda,\" she said.</p><p> Arjun Sethi, head of global management consulting firm Kearney's Apac region and vice-chair of Kearney's Digital Transformation Practice, feels the same sense of urgency; he said the IPCC's stark warning for all stakeholders reiterates the importance of direct and immediate action.</p><p> \"Businesses can no longer write off climate change as a problem for the next CEO; the status quo is falling away and there is a real cost to inaction, whether you are a government, global multinational or an SME (small and medium-sized enterprise),\" he said.</p><p> Jo Feng, senior vice-president, Asia area, at global biopharmaceutical business AstraZeneca, points out that \"the good news is that change is still within our grasp - but only if we all act swiftly and in every way we can\".</p><p> \"What we need to do now is focus on what changes can be made, through taking a science-driven approach, and how we mitigate the impact of climate change. Building resilience is key,\" she added.</p><p> Manish Pant, zone president, East Asia &amp; Japan, Schneider Electric, a global specialist in energy management and automation, believes climate change is a true challenge for humanity, and consumers, governments, and corporates all have a role to play in tackling climate change.</p><p> \"This includes rethinking approaches to energy and reducing carbon emissions drastically by establishing more sustainable practices,\" he said.</p><p>Efforts to adapt</p><p> But just as important as addressing the cause of climate change, through mitigation efforts such as decarbonisation, is the need to adapt to the effect of climate change - by changing the way we live.</p><p> Examples of climate adaptation include strengthening sea walls to brace for rising sea levels, managing forests to reduce the risk of forest fires and to prevent landslides, and planting crops that would be more resilient to weather extremes.</p><p> Adaptation solutions also abound in urban planning - an area in which governments and corporations can unite their efforts; these can take the form of climate-proofing infrastructure or greening buildings.</p><p> Climate adaptation efforts are crucial because weather extremes - such as increased heatwaves, droughts and floods - are already exceeding plants' and animals' tolerance thresholds, according to the IPCC's latest report; such events have also exposed millions of people to acute food and water insecurity.</p><p> Ambitious, accelerated action is therefore needed to adapt to climate change - at the same time as making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - to avoid mounting loss of life, biodiversity and infrastructure, the IPCC added.</p><p> Feng says this means that scaling up investment in adaptation is no longer optional, given that the ability of nature and humanity to adapt to it will be outpaced without urgent action. \"There is no doubt climate change and our adaptation to it is one of the most complex issues that we face today.\"</p><p> Sethi agrees. \"We can't meet 2022 conditions and reach 2030 targets with a business model from 2015, whether you are a government or a private company,\" he said.</p><p> \"Scaling up investment in adaptation efforts will be useful to fund more effective initiatives in full, rather than half-measures, but without modernising climate strategies and incorporating effective metrics, these investments may have a limited impact.\"</p><p> Pant believes that governments worldwide must make a strong commitment to such efforts and take the lead in laying out the plans, implementing the relevant policy changes and regulations, and putting in place funding support to fuel the relevant adaptation strategies.</p><p> \"As the size and value of climate-related risks increase, corporates must also look at strategies to transform their business to adjust to the changing climate,\" he added.</p><p> Adaptation will be critical here in Asia, says Aubertin-Noel, given the region's contribution to GHG emissions, its population size - with the Asia-Pacific region representing 60 per cent of the world's population - and its growing economic heft.</p><p>COP27 and financing</p><p> So far, progress in adaptation has been uneven, says the IPCC: most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, designed to respond to current impacts or near-term risks, and focused more on planning rather than implementation, with the largest adaptation gaps existing among the lower-income population groups.</p><p> Many will therefore be looking to this year's UN Climate Change Conference, COP27, to be held in Egypt in November, for governments' policy stances in this regard - and for indications on how poorer nations will be aided in their efforts.</p><p> Aubertin-Noel, citing a 2021 United Nations Global Compact-Accenture CEO Study on Sustainability, said the UN Environment Programme has estimated that adaptation costs will keep rising - reaching US$140 billion to US$300 billion a year in 2030, and US$280 billion to US$500 billion in 2050.</p><p> COP27 is likely to see financing efforts continue to push for adaptation strategies and solutions, especially to support those countries most at risk from climate change, Sethi said.</p><p> In Feng's view, the conference will be a welcome opportunity to build on commitments to achieve shared goals of reducing emissions and the impact of climate change, while also bringing a focus on funding for developing nations.</p><p>Partnerships</p><p> Pundits agree that concerted and coordinated action by various stakeholders will be needed to push through what has been deemed necessary by the IPCC to save the planet.</p><p> \"At every level of action,\" Sethi says, \"collaboration and cross-regional support hold the power to drive mutually beneficial sustainable efforts and create lucrative partnerships that benefit the environment, the people, and help a company survive the coming changes ... Regulation, technologies and initiatives must be implemented quickly for maximum impact.\"</p><p> Feng says greater collaboration through public-private partnerships is needed, along with genuine representation from developing countries most at risk of the consequences of climate change, to drive forward efforts to decarbonise. \"Science tells us it's time for everyone to do their part to limit the impacts of the climate crisis on our planet, and global partnership-driven initiatives play a crucial role in ensuring a secure future. No organisation, government, or institution can do it alone.\"</p><p> Pant believes that transformative policy change across more economies is urgently needed in order to decarbonise at the speed and scale required to achieve net-zero by 2050. \"This is because action from governments can accelerate even more action from companies,\" he said.</p><p> Aubertin-Noel agrees: \"Global companies can make an impact not only on the countries where they operate, but also on their ecosystem, such as the social and economic fabric, to influence consumers to make smarter, more eco-conscious choices.\"</p><p> Pant adds that technology will play a key role in aiding such efforts: digitisation, powered by the Internet of Things, can help companies create achievable targets for a greener future and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, while technological solutions can also help rural communities to become more productive, efficient and increase their local revenues. \"Apart from efforts by local governments, corporates too have a vital role to play in enabling access to energy and allowing energy-poor populations to develop in a sustainable way,\" he said.</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 21, "title": "Green accolade for Takeda's energy-positive building", "published": "2023-03-31", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Japanese pharmaceutical giant Takeda on Thursday raised the bar for sustainability in the biotech manufacturing sector, with one of its buildings now being able to produce more renewable energy than it consumes, making it energy-positive. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Its manufacturing support building, one of its two buildings at its Woodlands manufacturing site, is the only one in its global suite and is one of seven buildings here that have been awarded the Green Mark Platinum Positive Energy accolade in Singapore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Keppel Infrastructure @ Changi building, which houses an intelligent operations control centre and energy transition innovation centre, achieved the same award in July 2022, and the National University of Singapore's School of Design and Environment 4 achieved it in June 2022. </p><p> The award by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) recognises a building's ability to generate at least 115 per cent of its energy consumption from renewable energy on-site.</p><p> The building, among other things, must also demonstrate best practices in other sustainability outcomes, such as climate resilience. </p><p> Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, who attended the launch of the building on Thursday, noted that when Takeda first broke ground on this building two years ago, it was the company's first \"zero energy\" building. </p><p> But it has now topped its own achievement and gone further to become an energy-positive building, she added.</p><p> The building has more than 660 solar photovoltaic panels covering an area of 1,600 sq m which generate between 30MW and 40MW of electricity each month, said the company. </p><p> About 15 per cent of this is saved on average, and will help to power its production plant, which is also located on-site in Woodlands.

It has been a long two weeks for Members, and not least for yourself, having somewhat less liberty than Members to move in and out of the Chamber.</p><p>Over the last two weeks, we had close to 70 hours of debate. 58 Members spoke over the two and a half days of the Budget debate. And we covered 661 cuts over seven days of Committee of Supply.</p><p>With the approval of the Government's fiscal policy for FY2023/24 and the estimates of expenditure in the Committee of Supply, and the passing of the Supply Bills a few minutes ago, this Parliament has taken an important step forward in positioning Singapore well for the post-pandemic future. The policies and strategies that we have debated and approved will help us navigate a world that is vastly different to the one we knew before the pandemic. A world that is much more complicated and unpredictable, characterised by slower growth, higher inflation, greater geopolitical contestations, fragmentation in the global economy, and a looming climate crisis.</p><p>Budget 2023 will enable us to adapt more nimbly to this changed world and to secure our future, anchored by a fair, sound and sustainable fiscal plan. Let me do a quick recap.</p><p>Against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and an evolving world order, we reaffirmed the need to uphold international law and rules-based multilateralism while maintaining a strong defence to safeguard our sovereignty and security. Russia's invasion of Ukraine serves as a continuing reminder that Singapore's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity must never be taken for granted.</p><p>In the face of a looming climate crisis, this Budget builds on previous budgets, and reinforces our commitment to sustainability and strengthens Singapore's climate resilience. In Budget 2021, we unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030. In Budget 2022, we took bold steps to raise our national climate ambitions at a time when many countries are struggling to stay the course, including increasing the carbon tax. Budget 2023 continues our efforts to work with our businesses, communities, and individuals, with a view to achieving net zero by 2050.</p><p>Apart from climate resilience, we also discussed food resilience and how to diversify food imports, produce our own food, and keep food affordable in the HDB heartlands.</p><p>Developing our businesses</p><p>Members also spoke about the need for companies and workers to adjust to major structural shifts, including an accelerated green transition, digitalisation, greater economic nationalism and protectionism. This brings about both opportunities and challenges. This Budget focuses our efforts on helping businesses and workers ride the winds of change, while helping them tide through this period of weaker growth and higher inflation.</p><p>On the economic front, we endorsed our approach of:</p><p>a. Attracting high-quality investments and developing new growth sectors such as sustainability in the tourism and transport sectors,</p><p>b. Strengthening global and regional cooperation by forging new cross-border agreements with like-minded partners in overlapping areas of interest such as the digital economy and sustainability, to enhance market access and create new opportunities for our businesses,</p><p>c. And encouraging economy-wide innovation and extending the necessary bespoke support to help our SMEs grow into globally leading companies through various measures, including the Enterprise Innovation Scheme, SME Co-Investment Fund, and Singapore Global Enterprises initiative.</p><p>Supporting our workers</p><p>We recognised - as we always have - that the end goal of economic growth is to provide Singaporeans with good employment opportunities and wages.To that end, we supported the appointment of Jobs-Skills Integrators to better translate skills training into employment outcomes. To ensure no workers are left behind, we supported the Uplifting Employment Credit, the enhanced Enabling Employment Credit and Progressive Wage Credit Scheme. And we agreed to protect all our workers by keeping the workplaces safe and inclusive, and to safeguard their future by enhancing retirement adequacy.</p><p>In this Budget, we also rightly acknowledged the cooperation, hard work and sacrifices of everyone in our long fight against COVID-19, especially our healthcare workers who soldiered at the frontline of our pandemic response. We considered how to protect and better support our healthcare workers in their careers. We will apply the valuable lessons learnt to transform the Public Service and our healthcare system to serve Singaporeans better.</p><p>Strengthening our social compact</p><p>We approved additional support measures under the Assurance Package and enhanced the permanent GST Voucher scheme, with most support extended to the lower-income families. We also topped up the ComCare Endowment Fund to provide additional support to the lower-income families. Through our endorsement of these moves, we signaled to Singaporeans that they can be assured we will see them through this challenging period of rising inflation and cost of living pressures.</p><p>Families, marriage and parenthood took centre stage in this Budget, and aptly so, given that the Budget Statement was delivered on Valentine's Day. We increased the financial support for the early years of raising a child. We doubled Unpaid Infant Care Leave and Government-paid Paternity Leave, sending a strong signal to fathers of the need for paternal involvement when a child is born and to encourage greater shared parenting responsibilities. We would also better support parents in balancing their work and family commitments through Flexible Work Arrangements.</p><p>As Minister in the Prime Minister's Office helping oversee marriage and parenthood measures, I also want to add that these measures are just the beginning of an important shift, where the whole of society moves to become one that values family well-being and supports caregiving both for the young and the old, and acts accordingly.</p><p>We reaffirmed the critical role that early childhood education plays in a child's holistic development and agreed to close the gap in preschool enrolment rates. KidSTART will be scaled up nationwide and Government-supported preschool places will be expanded.

Good morning, and welcome to Singapore. I am pleased to join you at the FIDIC 2023 Global Infrastructure Conference.</p><p>2. Today, as we come together to discuss sustainable strategies for a better world, it is fitting to recognise the journey of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) over the last 110 years. Beginning with three members in 1913 to its current stature with more than 100 members from around the world, FIDIC has contributed much to our living environment. Allow me to extend my congratulations on reaching this milestone!</p><p>3. As a grouping for consulting engineers, FIDIC's role has expanded beyond its initial position as the international voice of the consulting engineering industry. It has become a beacon of innovation and sustainability, and a testament to the dedication and foresight of engineers who have helped to reshape our world.</p><p>Role of Engineers to Water Management in Singapore</p><p>4. We have much to thank the engineering industry for. In Singapore, engineers play an instrumental role in helping us navigate the unique challenges of our environment and circumstances, marked by our limited land space, highly built-up cityscape and tropical weather. Therefore, simply replicating measures from other countries would not suffice. Instead, we must adapt and fine-tune these approaches to align with our specific needs and unique circumstances, a task at which our engineers excel in.</p><p>5. Take, for example, our approach to managing water and energy needs in Singapore. Our engineers have to consider how to optimise land-use in Singapore, while tackling our water and energy needs. Our engineers have found ways to utilise the broad surface areas of our reservoirs by deploying floating solar platforms. Additionally, they have created more room for further urban development by freeing up 150 hectares of land previously occupied by water pumping stations aboveground. This was achieved by constructing underground sewers to convey used water by gravity to water reclamation plants. 150 hectares of land may not sound like a lot to many of you from larger countries, but Singapore is only a small island of 730 square kilometres, so 150 hectares saved from infrastructure to use more meaningfully is a huge saving.</p><p>6. But beyond devising innovative solutions in water management for land-scarce Singapore, we also need engineers - and the appropriate infrastructures - to help us keep pace with the increasing demands for water in a growing population and economy.</p><p>7. Currently, our daily water consumption is approximately 440 million gallons, equivalent to around 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Projections suggest that this demand will nearly double by 2065, with the non-domestic sector accounting for almost half of our total water consumption. To tackle this challenge, we are committed to collecting, treating, reclaiming, and reusing every drop of used water while expanding our water resources.</p><p>Building a Sustainable Future</p><p>8. This commitment takes on added significance in the context of climate change. Weather events that were once rare are now becoming more frequent. Aside from the increased risk of haze, the intensification of El Nio conditions - predicted to persist until the end of 2023 - could lead to more droughts and water shortages across the region.</p><p>9. This reality underscores the importance of long-term planning and investments in resilient infrastructure and sustainable practices to safeguard our communities. Engineers, as problem solvers and innovators, are not merely key players in building a sustainable future but also our protectors against climate change. For the many of you in our midst today, you play a pivotal role in addressing the unique challenges posed by climate change whichever country you are residing in. Whether it is addressing water scarcity or reinforcing coastal defences against rising sea levels, engineers are best placed to lead the global charge against climate change. In the search for alternative cleaner energy sources, engineers, again, play a very important role. To combat climate change, we need good engineering solutions to help us transit into a low-carbon future.</p><p>10. Building a sustainable future requires engineers to collaborate, not just among themselves, but more importantly across borders and geographies. International collaboration is crucial, as it allows engineers to pool resources and work together to find new ideas and solutions that transcend geographical boundaries. One avenue for engineers to effect change is through active participation in fora like the Conference FIDIC has organised today. Global initiatives such as international research partnerships and knowledge-sharing networks will help to catalyse innovative ideas and spark new innovations and bring about change. In doing so, engineers will have the opportunity to drive transformative change on both national and international fronts.</p><p>11. Through these efforts, engineers can become catalysts for positive change, leading the way towards a more sustainable and resilient future for future generations, echoing the legacy of our forefathers who had worked hard to make the world a better place.</p><p>Singapore's Commitment to Sustainability</p><p>12. Even as we find ways to tackle the existential threats that come with climate change, we must also prioritise minimising our impact on the planet. To that end, Singapore is fully committed to accelerating our sustainability efforts and transitioning toward a low-carbon future. In 2021, we launched our Singapore Green Plan 2030 as a nationwide movement to tackle climate change. This comprehensive plan charts bold and concrete strategies for Singapore to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>13. The Green Plan not only focuses on decarbonising our economy and increasing the use of renewable resources, but also emphasises the importance of enhancing Singapore's climate resilience.</p><p>14. Integral to the Green Plan is the latest edition of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, which was similarly launched in 2021. The Masterplan clearly outlines our ambitious sustainability goals for the Built Environment - to achieve \"80-80-80 in 2030\":</p><p>* 80% of our buildings to be green by 2030;</p><p>* 80% of new developments to be Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings from 2030;</p><p>* and 80% improvement in energy efficiency (over 2005 levels) for best-in-class green buildings by 2030.</p><p>15. The Masterplan creates significant opportunities for engineers to contribute to sustainability. Sustainable infrastructure projects not only fulfil critical societal needs, but also minimise environmental impact and enhance long-term resilience. In doing so, engineers can champion for a more sustainable future, where infrastructure serves as a cornerstone of both progress and our responsibility to the environment.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>16. Let me conclude. The progress of society at large is very much intertwined with the good work of the men and women in the engineering industry. While the challenges of climate change may not make your work any easier, they underscore the vital role you play in addressing the most pressing issues of our time.</p><p>17. You have the unique privilege and responsibility to venture into uncharted territories, question prevailing norms, and shape an enduring future. I am confident that the insights and connections forged today will serve as a wellspring of inspiration and progress.</p><p>18.

Good morning.</p><p>1. I am pleased to join you today at Grow Asia's Investment Forum 2023. I would like to thank Grow Asia for its continued efforts to strengthen and develop sustainable agriculture and reliable food supplies across Southeast Asia. This is a crucial area of work.</p><p>2. Our global food system is facing challenging times. Around the world, climate change and geopolitical tensions are causing significant disruptions to global food supplies. The war in Ukraine significantly disrupted grain and fertiliser export from the breadbasket of Europe. This fuelled inflation and prompted several countries to introduce export restrictions to protect domestic food supplies.</p><p>3. We are also increasingly seeing the impacts of climate change on food production yields. Last year saw multiple temperature records being broken, and extreme weather events such as floods and heavy rainfall impacting multiple regions. These are stark reminders of the vulnerability of the global food system, and even more so, the urgent need for a resilient and sustainable food system in Asia.</p><p>4. Food systems are not mere victims of climate change. It is also a cause of climate change. Through land clearing, loss of biodiversity, the irresponsible use of pesticides, fungicides impacting the environment, serious creation of greenhouse gases in the process of agriculture. It is really our responsibility to look at how we can make it good.</p><p>5. One thing is clear - that we must place food security as a priority. We need to transform our food systems to achieve better productivity, climate-resilience, and resource-efficiency. This will require more financing, innovation and collaboration.</p><p>6. And this is where the Grow Asia Investment Forum can play an important role. \"Investing in Food System Transformation\" can drive transformative change in our region through partnerships in blended finance, innovation in sustainable agricultural development, and collaboration to improve livelihoods of farming communities.</p><p>7. By leveraging climate finance through a public-private blended financing model, to the tune of US$1b, the GrowBeyond Fund has the potential of supporting over 200,000 farmers over the next 10 years to access finance and technical assistance. This model builds upon public private partnerships, by combining public and private funds to leverage the strengths of both sectors, to address the needs of food systems transformation.</p><p>8. It is estimated that with these investments, farms will see an increase in productivity of up to 30 per cent, and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 30 per cent. Such impact investments are what the world needs now. It will not only strengthen the region's food security but also contribute towards environment sustainability.</p><p>9. Technology and innovation will be a key enabler for the region's food system transformation. In Singapore, we are working with our agri-food industry to build our capability and capacity to produce 30 per cent of our nutritional needs in a sustainable manner by 2030.</p><p>10. To achieve this, we are investing in R&amp;D and supporting our farms in their take-up of productive farm systems. Under the Singapore Food Story R&amp;D programme, we have committed more than $300 million to fund innovative research projects that address key challenges of our agrifood industry. These include urban agriculture and aquaculture practices, future foods and food safety.</p><p>11 For instance, we have awarded two projects led by NUS and Republic Polytechnic to improve the shelf-life and nutritional quality of commonly consumed local vegetables such as kailan, bok choy and choy sum. Such translational R&amp;D efforts will also be relevant to agri-food industries in the region and help to enhance our collective food security.</p><p>12. We are supporting our farms in deploying technology to raise productivity, by co-funding farming infrastructure and systems. First through the Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF), and now with the S$60 million Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund.</p><p>13. Many farms have tapped on these funds to deploy technology and innovation. Take Green Harvest for instance, which had tapped on the APF for capability upgrading. They have invested in a new modern greenhouse and transformed from a soil-based conventional vegetable farming to a highly mechanised and automated, climate-controlled growing techniques without the use of pesticides, and with only 19 workers on-site. With a plot size of 2 hectares, they are expected to produce 700 tonnes per hectare per year. This is more than 5 times the average productivity of traditional farming methods.</p><p>14. Beyond research, we are supporting our industry by optimising land use through holistic land planning and innovative design. With less than 1% of our land set aside for agri-food production, we have to 'grow more with less'.</p><p>15. We are transforming the Lim Chu Kang region into a vibrant, productive agri-food cluster, with the active participation of our farmers and stakeholders. The region is being planned with possible features such as: infrastructure to support high productivity farming; shared services and facilities, such as solid waste treatment, packing facilities for farms to achieve economies of scale; and circular economy principles to optimise resource use.</p><p>16. How do we encourage farmers to pull resources together, allowing the waste stream of one entity to be used as input of another? Having that facilitation in a small area in Lim Chu Kang will reduce the logistical requirements, and the carbon footprint of the entire sector. That is really the vision of a highly productive, resource resilient and sustainable model of agriculture in Singapore.</p><p>17. We are also transforming our sea spaces to unlock the potential for sustainable fish farming. We are working closely with the aquaculture industry, academics, and nature groups to increase productivity in an environmentally sustainable way.</p><p>18. Collaboration is key in this transformation. I am glad this forum has brought together many like-minded stakeholders and senior leaders across various sectors. The transformation of our food systems will require more financing, innovation and collaboration. When we put our minds together and tap on the strengths and networks of other stakeholders, we can achieve far greater outcomes.</p><p>19. I encourage you to make full use of this forum to exchange knowledge, explore collaborations, and take steps closer to the solutions we need to strengthen our region's food security. There will be further platforms in Singapore to exchange knowledge and explore collaborations, such as the Singapore International Agri-food Week later this year. I would like to invite you to join us then.</p><p>20. Let me conclude. The challenges facing our region's food security are already at our doorstep, and we must act decisively to build the resilience of our food supplies. Yet, the challenges on hand are bigger than any single country alone. We must work together, tap on one another's strengths, and collaborate to ultimately achieve a win-win outcome.</p><p>21. Once again, thank you Grow Asia for inviting me to speak at this summit. I wish you all a fruitful forum ahead.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 40, "title": "Growing stress on power generation plants amid climate change", "published": "2022-08-29", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Severe heatwaves and droughts in China, the United States and Europe have caused blackouts and disrupted the lives of millions of people and businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The disasters underscore how increasingly extreme weather and rising temperatures are threatening the world's power generation systems, from dried-up rivers shutting down hydropower plants, to storms and floods knocking out power lines, to heatwaves pushing grids to the limit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Experts said urgent steps are needed to make power systems more resilient, given the world is forecast to consume increasing amounts of electricity for heating and cooling, as well as for electrification of transport.</p><p> \"Climate change directly affects every segment of the electricity system, altering generation potential and efficiency, testing physical resilience of transmission and distribution networks, and changing demand patterns,\" said the International Energy Agency (IEA) in a report last year on energy security and climate resilience.</p><p> It said the increasing frequency or intensity of extreme weather events is the dominant cause of large-scale outages in many countries. Rising sea levels are another threat since many power plants are sited near coastlines.</p><p> Recent disasters reveal how exposed power systems are.</p><p> In California, for instance, huge demand for air-conditioning this month has pushed the state's grid to the brink. Several large hydropower plants that provide power to millions in the western US are facing critically low water levels.</p><p> In Texas in February last year, a series of intense winter storms knocked out much of the state's power generation, causing widespread outages.</p><p> The risks are rising as demand for power is also growing, as economies in Asia and elsewhere consume more energy. For example, global residential stocks of air-conditioning could increase by another two-thirds by 2030, the IEA said.</p><p> Dr Zhong Sheng, a research fellow at the Energy Studies Institute (ESI) at the National University of Singapore, said: \"Due to heatwaves and droughts, there would be significant increases in cooling demand, in industrial, commercial and residential sectors, especially in those highly populated regions.\"</p><p> He added: \"The high demand in cooling in a short period of time leads to further pressures on power generation and can introduce uncertainties to power grids.\"</p><p> One of the top risks is water.</p><p> A record drought and weeks-long heatwave in south-west China has led to dozens of rivers and reservoirs drying up and slashed hydropower generation capacity in Sichuan province by half.</p><p> Hydropower is the biggest source of electricity supply in Sichuan, and it is also the second-largest source of electricity in China at 16 per cent. Coal is the top source.</p><p> In South and South-east Asia, hydropower accounts for 14.5 per cent of total electricity generation, the IEA said in a separate report on the region.</p><p> In some countries such as Bhutan and Nepal, hydropower accounts for over 90 per cent of total electricity generation.</p><p> The installed hydropower capacity is expected to grow further to meet the region's growing electricity demand and electricity export opportunities.</p><p> For example, Laos plans to build more dams to sell power to its neighbours and Singapore recently began trial imports of power from Laos via Thailand and Malaysia.</p><p> But the IEA noted that rising temperatures, extreme rainfall patterns, melting glaciers and floods pose serious challenges to South and South-east Asian hydropower.</p><p> The Straits Times, in a recent visit to Nepal, saw first-hand the destruction caused by a recent flood triggered by intense rainfall high in the mountains that carried vast amounts of debris downstream.</p><p> Similar floods are a huge and growing risk to the country's hydropower plants.</p><p> Large amounts of water are also needed for cooling and steam generation in nuclear, coal and gas power plants. The steam is needed to drive turbines to generate power.</p><p> This is why these plants are usually sited next to lakes and rivers or by the sea. But droughts, heatwaves and freezing conditions can disrupt access to water, causing plants to cut back on power generation or shut down.</p><p> Thermal power plants make up about 75 per cent of generating capacity globally.</p><p> What can be done to reduce the risks'</p><p> Burying power lines underground and using deep tunnels, which Singapore does, reduces the risks from hot weather and storms. Singapore has also integrated desalination plants and power stations, boosting water output.</p><p> More water-efficient cooling systems are another resilience measure. Globally, some plants use dry cooling, which involves fans pumping in large volumes of air and using less water.</p><p> The IEA said comprehensive climate risk and impact assessments, strengthening or hardening the design of power systems to better cope with future climate extremes, and broadening the types of power generation can also help.</p><p> Ms Ojasvee Arora, a research associate at ESI, said it is ironic that the power sector is vulnerable to climate change impacts while also being a significant contributor to the crisis - accounting for more than two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> She noted that Asean is among the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world and that its electricity demand is also set to increase over the next decade, \"reflecting a true climate-energy paradox\".</p><p> \"Hence, it is important to identify appropriate pathways for the power sector that are more resilient, sustainable and able to meet the increasing electricity demand.</p><p> \"There is also room for further global energy cooperation to enhance climate resilience among Asean countries.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The disasters underscore how increasingly extreme weather and rising temperatures are threatening the world's power generation systems, from dried-up rivers shutting down hydropower plants, to storms and floods knocking out power lines, to heatwaves pushing grids to the limit.

We discussed a wide range of topics over the past two days - inclusivity, the importance of heritage conservation, accelerating de-carbonisation and strengthening climate resilience; as well as promoting innovation and creativity.</p><p>6. Many mayors and city leaders shared about the creative programmes that they have implemented to empower the community to make your cities more liveable.</p><p>a. For example, Deputy Mayor Hamidreza from Tehran shared about the innovative \"I am the mayor\" plan, where citizens were asked on how the municipal budget should be allocated and which municipal projects should be prioritized.

Many Mayors also shared how they've identified vulnerable groups and ensured that policies are targeted in helping to level the playing field.</p><p>a. For example, Mayor Desmond Choo shared about Comlink, how the proactive, data-driven, and coordinated approach helps to integrate support across agencies and charities by putting low income families at the heart of what they do.</p><p>b. Another innovative initiative was the Seoul Learn project introduced by Mayor Oh Se-hoon. This project helps to improve equal access to educational opportunities by ensuring that vulnerable youths have access to high quality education materials through a shared online platform.</p><p>8. We've also heard about the different strategies that cities from different continents around the world have taken to conserve and even inject new lease of life into their cultural heritage, such as Gaborone, Sao Paolo, and Budapest.</p><p>9. There were also many innovative ideas on how cities can tackle climate change and its downstream effects.</p><p>a. Many cities have shared about how local governments have taken the lead in adopting new technology such as the use of green hydrogen in Vienna's district heating and cooling efforts, as well as green energy from innovative sources such as the floating panels in Singapore.</p><p>Call to action to try innovative new policies and to collaborate with each other</p><p>10. We also heard city leaders from Seoul and Tallinn speak about the importance of retrofitting old buildings to bring them up to speed on green building technology. We heard about Makassar, Dhaka South, Tallinn, and Antwerp talk about greening of waterways, cities and green spaces. I think all of us remember the Pollinator Highway in Tallinn and Big Link in Antwerp.</p><p>11. Many of you also spoke about the need to go beyond individual projects, to go central, to go district, to go regional - for example, in Vienna - as well as the Young Leaders who shared about how cities can collaborate through waste management and recycling. You also heard from Maputo about how industries can be made green through deliberate planning of industrial parks and deployment of EVs.</p><p>12. We heard about climate actions, we also heard about how Mayors incorporate innovation and creativity to make the lives of citizens better and to help enterprises flourish. We heard about the open-source data-driven approach taken by Taipei City Dashboard, we heard about construction productivity in Singapore, we heard about the whole range of start-up incubators and launchpad service in Singapore, and Brunei's iCentre. We heard about the support in Danang for SMEs as well as the innovation efforts to support startups in Sebarang Perai in Penang. In Antwerp, we saw how rainwater harvesting helps cities clean trucks and do their work while being more sustainable.</p><p>13. The use of innovation and knowledge can also help cities differentiate and level up on their competitive advantages. For example, the ambition of Vienna to be city of knowledge, not just in Europe, but also of the world, and how through apprenticeships that are very established in the German-speaking world had enabled a workforce of the future.</p><p>14. We also heard a heed of warning from Prof Lam Khee Poh from NUS, telling us that time is non-renewable - a very important point - and about innovation and technology. The young leaders also suggested more open engagements that can bring the private sector, social sector and people sector together to bring creativity and innovation into today's plans and designs that run our cities, while Isabel from the IFC shared very much about the benefits of technologies in cities. For example, InfraTech - how it leads services for model cities, how it reduces OPEX and CAPEX costs, and how it can bring climate and social impacts to bear positive gains to our cities.</p><p>15. I have not done justice in this very brief summary of all the discussions that have been made during the course of these two days. But, I think the important point is that while we have had very good sharing and discussion, the work of the Mayors Forum must not stop here. I hope that the discussions have inspired you to bring back some of these ideas to your own cities where you can study them, adapt them to your own local context and try them out.</p><p>16. After all, cities wherever we are in the world, share many of the same challenges, from the consequential effects of the pandemic, to other serious concerns like the climate crisis and disruptions brought about by digitalisation and AI. A solution that has worked in one city may have a good chance of success in another city, too. My advice is to learn what makes those projects succeed and adapt them to our local context.</p><p>17. If you were particularly interested in any of the shared initiatives, I hope that you have followed up with the speaker. In fact, one of the key objectives of the Mayors Forum is to build long-lasting networks and trust between different cities and city leaders, between city leaders and the young people and between city leaders and our enterprises, and for the learning and sharing of best practices to extend well beyond these two days. For example, you can organise cross-exchange trips to other cities to get a more in-depth look at how certain policies have been implemented.</p><p>18. In the upcoming editions of the World Cities Summit Mayors Forum, we look forward to hearing more about how mayors and city leaders have taken ideas shared in the Forum discussions as models to learn from and possibly even implement in their home city.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>19. As leaders and city representatives, we are well-positioned to galvanise stakeholders across people, public and private spheres of influence, to think long-term and implement innovative policies. I hope that the Mayors Forum has been helpful to all of you and it was useful to see policies put into practice right here in Seoul.</p><p>20. On that note, I invite all of you to next year's Mayors Forum and the World Cities Summit 2024 in Singapore from 2 to 4 June, and of course, the 2025 WCS Mayors Forum to be hosted in Vienna, Austria our 2020 Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Laureate, where we will take this conversation forward.</p><p>21. We look forward to seeing you all again. Thank you very much and I wish all of you a safe journey back home.

This includes restoration of the coastal beach forest and a new Keppel Coastal Trail, which Keppel Corporation has pledged to donate S$1 million to through the Garden City Fund. The coastal beach forest and Keppel Coastal Trail will act as an important physical and ecological buffer for the adjacent coastal hill forest and enhance ecological connectivity, while allowing visitors to learn more about coastal habitats. Design and development of the Trail will commence in 2022. NParks' efforts to restore the habitats of Labrador Nature Reserve will strengthen its ecological and climate resilience, and allow the public to experience its nature while minimising impact to biodiversity, so as to safeguard and enhance it in the long term.</p><p>NParks also commemorated the 50th anniversary of the nation-wide Tree Planting Day this morning. To mark the occasion, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee and members of the community planted 50 native coastal trees at Labrador Nature Reserve. In addition, at the event, NParks dedicated Heritage Trees to donors who have contributed to Singapore's greening and conservation efforts through the Garden City Fund, in acknowledgement of the important role that the community plays in transforming Singapore into a City in Nature, one of the key pillars of the Singapore Green Plan. Minister Desmond Lee presented the Heritage Tree plaques to these donors at the event.</p><p>Forest Restoration Action Plan for Labrador Nature Reserve</p><p>First introduced in 2019 for Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve and the Central Nature Park Network, the Forest Restoration Action Plan seeks to strengthen the ecological and climate resilience of our native forests by restoring ecological processes, and enhancing the biodiversity and ecological connectivity in these areas. This will improve the habitats for native biodiversity.</p><p>One of the rare and unique habitats in Labrador Nature Reserve is the coastal hill forest. The 10-hectare coastal hill forest houses plants that grow on land adjacent to the sea and are tolerant to salt exposure and poorer soil conditions, some species of which are now very rare. We are replanting its slopes with suitable native species, including the critically endangered Broad-leaf Fern (Dipteris conjugate). The edges of the coastal hill forest are also being extended through the planting of native coastal plants.</p><p>To further strengthen the ecological and climate resilience of this core habitat, we are restoring a coastal beach forest in the 2.5-hectare area between the coastal hill forest and the sea. This will provide a significant physical and ecological buffer for the coastal hill forest, as well as increased sources of food and shelter for the fauna of Labrador Nature Reserve and its surrounding environment. The area will be planted with native species suited to the coastal environment, and rustic trails and paths will be provided to allow visitors to experience this habitat.</p><p>Our habitat restoration efforts will extend beyond the terrestrial area into the sea. The other habitat which is rare and unique, and which characterises Labrador Nature Reserve, is the rocky shore, as it is the last remaining natural rocky shore on mainland Singapore. The rocky shore comprises coral rubble, sandy substrates and seagrass beds, with rich intertidal faunal diversity. NParks has conducted intertidal surveys of the rocky shore and the seagrasses in collaboration with partners in the nature community. The surveys have recorded a wide diversity of marine species, including Blue-spotted Fantail Rays, eagle rays, and Blacktip Reef Sharks. Long-term monitoring of the rocky shore will guide future enhancement efforts and ensure the continued health of the habitat.</p><p>In conjunction with the forest restoration efforts, compatible recreational uses will be relocated from the core areas to the buffers. There will continue to be opportunities for passive nature recreation, such as educational walks along nature trails, as well as for other recreational activities, at areas further away from the core areas such as the entrance area.</p><p>Keppel Corporation's earlier pledge of S$3 million will contribute to the planting of 10,000 trees as part of the OneMillionTrees movement, about half of which will be at Labrador Nature Reserve and will help to restore the coastal beach forest. Keppel Corporation is now contributing a further S$1 million through the Garden City Fund for a new Keppel Coastal Trail. The Keppel Coastal Trail will weave through the coastal beach forest and will be curated with information boards to allow visitors to learn more about coastal habitats, while providing views of the sea from vantage points along the trail.</p><p>50th Anniversary of Tree Planting Day</p><p>To kick-start the greening of Singapore, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had directed that a tree planting campaign be launched in 1963. On 16 June 1963, Mr Lee planted a Mempat tree (Cratoxylum formosum) at Farrer Circus to mark the start of Singapore's greening programme. This was followed by a mass tree planting all over the city - along new roads, on traffic circuses, in housing estates, schools and car parks.</p><p>To support these greening efforts, an annual community tree-planting activity was subsequently inaugurated on 7 November 1971. Then-Acting Prime Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, led the community in tree-planting on Singapore's first Tree Planting Day at Mount Faber Park. Island-wide tree-planting activities with the community were led by various Ministers and Members of Parliament in their constituencies. Tree Planting Day has since been included as part of the annual Clean and Green Singapore campaign. It continues to be a significant annual tradition for the community to come together to plant trees as it reflects Singapore's commitment to and support of our climate resilience efforts, the City in Nature vision and the Singapore Green Plan. These efforts have been intensified by the ongoing OneMillionTrees movement with the strong support from community.</p><p>To commemorate the occasion, 50 coastal trees comprising 25 native species were planted at Labrador Nature Reserve. The public can also be a part of this annual event by joining the upcoming OneMillionTrees webinar on Singapore's coastal forests on 13 November 2021 at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/events-and-workshops/2021/11/one-million-trees-webinar-9\">https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/events-and-workshops/2021/11/one-million-trees-webinar-9</url>.</p><p>Heritage Trees around Singapore dedicated to donors</p><p>NParks' efforts in greening, research and conservation, as well as education and outreach, would not have been possible without support from the community. This includes the donors from various sectors, whose contributions through NParks' registered charity and IPC, the Garden City Fund, are helping to enhance green spaces across Singapore and expand recreational and educational opportunities for visitors. As a mark of appreciation to these individuals and organisations for their gift contributions of at least S$1 million towards fulfilling our City in Nature vision, NParks has dedicated the following Heritage Trees to them:</p><p>* Tahitian Chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer) in Singapore Botanic Gardens - Dr Rosslyn Leong Sou Fong</p><p>* Kapur (Dryobalanops aromatica) in Singapore Botanic Gardens - Mr Leslie Tan's late mother and sister, June and Janet Tan</p><p>* Longan (Dimocarpus longan) in Sembawang Park - Micron</p><p>* Sea Almond (Terminalia catappa) near Pasir Panjang Park - PSA</p><p>Source: National Parks Board of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["The coastal beach forest and Keppel Coastal Trail will act as an important physical and ecological buffer for the adjacent coastal hill forest and enhance ecological connectivity, while allowing visitors to learn more about coastal habitats.

Yet in other matches, one helps the other through tough times. So too in the coral world do these fortuitous couplings exist, with specific pairings between coral and microbiome conferring the organism with more resilience against heat stress. </p><p> \"Depending on the association between the coral and its microbes, the coral can be more resilient to stress,\" said Dr Huang, who also leads the NUS Reef Ecology Laboratory.</p><p> What these pairings are is something that Dr Huang wants to find out. </p><p> With a research grant he received under the Marine Climate Change Science Programme, Dr Huang and his team will play matchmaker, looking for the best matches between coral and microbes which allow the holobiont (referring to both the coral itself and its microbiome) to survive in an ocean set to boil.  </p><p> The programme was launched in 2021 by the National Parks Board (NParks).</p><p> Dr Huang's research joins a host of other research projects taking off in Singapore that aim to look at how coral reefs can withstand the impacts of climate change.</p><p> Even the name of the programme his research is funded under provides a clue -- the Marine Climate Change Science programme, earlier known as the Marine Science Research and Development Programme. </p><p> This focus on climate resilience marks a new chapter in the story of Singapore's coral reef science journey, which previously had a large focus on how reefs can bounce back after loss or degradation due to coastal development. </p><p> \"This change is something that is reflected globally as well,\" said Dr Jani Tanzil, the facility director at Singapore's St John's Island National Marine Laboratory. </p><p> \"Coral reefs are still facing many local threats, like coastal development, urbanisation and sedimentation. But now they also have to deal with climate change.\" </p><p> Climate change, caused by an ever-thickening blanket of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is a global problem. </p><p> Countries are gathering in Dubai from Nov 30 to Dec 12 for COP28, the United Nations climate change conference, to galvanise climate action and call on nations to taper down the use of fossil fuels to limit global warming. </p><p> But it may take some time yet for global politics -- and national policies -- to catch up with what the science clearly points to. </p><p> In the interim, research efforts that look into increasing the resilience of Singapore's remaining coral reefs, which are clinging on despite the odds, will be paramount if they are to have a fighting chance of survival in a warming planet. </p><p> A story of loss and hopeThe history of Singapore's coral reefs could, depending on how you look at it, be a tragedy or offer a glimmer of hope. Over 60 per cent of coral reefs in the city-state have been lost over the years due to reclamation and coastal development works. Yet life still persists.</p><p> NUS Emeritus Professor Chou Loke Ming, a pioneer in Singapore's marine science and conservation community, saw first-hand the impact of the country's early coastal works. </p><p> \"In the 1960s, the water was clear. Standing on the boat, you could look down and see corals all the way down the reef slope, to depths of 10m or more. I was so taken by their beauty,\" he recalled. Today, coral life is now found mainly in shallower waters, at depths not exceeding 5m.</p><p> In 1977, Prof Chou started the Reef Ecology Laboratory at NUS, and studied various types of reef life -- from tropical fish to nudibranchs (sea slugs). </p><p> The lab in 1989 started testing the feasibility of deploying man-made structures -- including hollow concrete cubes and tyre-pyramid modules -- to improve fish stocks. </p><p> It also conducted a number of reef surveys, with Prof Chou and his colleagues recording species diversity and abundance at various sites. But there was no standardised survey method then, making it hard to compare results across sites in Singapore or even the region, he said. </p><p> In the late 1980s, Prof Chou was among marine biologists from South-east Asia who took part in the Asean-Australia Coastal Living Resources Project. That effort resulted in the development of standardised sampling protocols.</p><p> For Singapore, it also resulted in a useful database of information on the Republic's coastal resources, including mangroves, coral reefs, and soft-bottom benthic (or bottom-dwelling) communities, which include worms and molluscs.</p><p> These developments laid the groundwork for the next phase of marine research efforts in the country: bringing a dying seafloor back to life.  </p><p> Healing a reef In Singapore, mitigation measures usually involve relocation of coral colonies away from sites due to be reclaimed to locations where they can, hopefully, take root and grow. </p><p> One of the earliest recorded efforts to do so was in the early 1990s, when the Nature Society (Singapore) called on over 400 volunteers to shift coral colonies from sites in the southern part of the country due to be reclaimed to Sentosa. </p><p> Barely 10 per cent of the translocated coral survived due to various factors, including an inappropriate choice of recipient site -- the area was often subjected to surge and heavy sedimentation -- and improper methods in securing fragments to substrate that caused the baby corals to be washed away. </p><p> That episode, however, had a silver lining -- it led to improvements in coral relocation techniques and subsequent mitigation projects.  </p><p> In the early 2000s, there was a global shift towards taking a \"gardening approach\" to reef restoration, said Dr Tanzil.</p><p> Inspired by the forest restoration efforts on land, the global coral community reasoned that a two-step protocol -- \"gardening\" small colonies in nurseries and then transplanting them to damaged areas -- could improve the chances of rejuvenating a reef. </p><p> In Singapore, too, the movement took off, with coral research coalescing around two parallel tracks: the development of artificial reefs for reef restoration, and the use of coral nurseries. </p><p> Dr Tanzil, also a senior research fellow at the NUS Tropical Marine Science Institute, started her career as a research assistant in Prof Chou's Reef Ecology Laboratory in 2004. By that time, she had been volunteering with the lab for two years and had been trained in various reef survey methodologies. </p><p> One of her first projects was to monitor coral recruitment on the reef enhancement units (REU) deployed in Singapore's southern islands under a collaboration between NUS and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). </p><p> That effort, which began in 2001 -- about a decade after Prof Chou's lab first deployed concrete modules and tyre pyramids in Singapore -- had a different focus. Instead of acting as fish aggregation devices, the REUs were being assessed on their ability to rejuvenate the coral reef to promote coastal tourism. </p><p> Prof Chou said that that project had focused on the natural recruitment of corals, although fragments were attached to the REUs if researchers came across them on the seafloor. Dr Tanzil mused: \"At that point, we had no nursery, we just took corals of opportunity -- what we called broken coral fragments on the seafloor -- and attached it to the artificial reef frame using epoxy.\" </p><p> But this was set to change. </p><p> By the mid-2000s, the coral gardening concept in Singapore was picking up steam. </p><p> The first coral nurseries were established in the southern waters to test if in-situ nurseries would be successful given the turbid conditions. Around that period, NUS was also involved in a project funded by the European Union to restore Indo-Pacific coral reefs in Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand, using the gardening approach. </p><p> Context in coral restoration is of the utmost importance, said Dr Karenne Tun, another protege of the Reef Ecology Lab under Prof Chou. Now the director of the terrestrial, coastal and marine branches at NParks' National Biodiversity Centre, Dr Tun said coral restoration techniques must be tailored to local contexts. </p><p> For example, in countries where the waters are clearer, coral fragments can be transplanted directly onto degraded reefs and thrive. </p><p> In Singapore, the chances of this being successful were lower due to the rubbly nature of the seafloor that made it difficult for the baby corals to gain a foothold. </p><p> The size that coral fragments should grow to before transplantation is also different in Singapore, she said. \"In other countries, nubbins (fragments) about 1cm or 2cm long can be transplanted and survive. But we found that in Singapore, fragments that grow to at least 10cm long stand a better chance of survival,\" Dr Tun added. </p><p> Eventually, the research paid off, with higher coral survival rates in subsequent translocation exercises.  </p><p> In 2013, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore funded a project to move corals from the Sultan Shoal, south-west of Singapore, to protect them from the impact of the Tuas Terminal development. Over 80 per cent of corals survived the move -- a marked improvement from the low survival rates from the effort in the early 1990s.</p><p> Sea change As the knowledge base of coral restoration science in Singapore accumulated, concerted efforts to protect the nation's marine biodiversity began to take shape. </p><p> Coral reef scientists in Singapore are continuing to push the frontiers of coral reef science, from growing corals on plastic toy blocks to maximise yield, to translocating nubbins to deeper, light-limited waters, where almost all corals have vanished. </p><p> At the same time, what was once an endeavour among academics gradually expanded to become more inclusive, involving government agencies, the private sector and civil society. </p><p> Ground-up \"blue plans\", developed by marine conservationists, scientists and volunteers, were published in 2001 and 2009, calling on the Government to protect Singapore's marine treasures. </p><p> In 2014, the country designated its first marine park -- the Sisters' Islands Marine Park -- which agent-based modelling had shown was Singapore's \"mother reef\" that seeds coral larvae to other marine habitats. </p><p> A community group, Friends of the Marine Park, was also established to promote stewardship and responsible use of the area. </p><p> The most recent edition of the blue plan -- which outlines six recommendations, including improved laws to protect marine environments and formalised management systems for these areas -- was published in 2018. </p><p> NParks also rolled out biodiversity impact assessment guidelines for marine spaces in 2020, helping to set minimum standards for such studies, which had previously differed among consultants. Previously, there was no locally standardised methodology for how such surveys should be conducted. </p><p> Most recently, in June 2023, NParks announced its most ambitious coral restoration plan to date: grow baby corals in nurseries and plant 100,000 of them at degraded coral reef sites or sites that could potentially support coral habitats over at least 10 years. </p><p> Since the 1980s, there has been a sea change in Singapore's efforts to bring its reefs back to life. </p><p> For Prof Chou, whose career charts the progress of coral reef science in Singapore -- from baseline mapping to artificial reef deployment and nursery development -- the current research frontier looks at how these important habitats can be made more resilient in the face of climate change.</p><p> This includes the work that Dr Huang -- who took over the reins of the Reef Ecology Lab when Prof Chou, his mentor, retired in 2014 -- is doing on the coral microbiome, as well as other projects looking into green-grey coastal infrastructure to protect the country from sea-level rise.  </p><p> In November 2022, Prof Chou was named an Asean Biodiversity Hero for his pioneering work on coral reef restoration and management. The award recognises passionate individuals in Asean who have dedicated their lives to protecting biodiversity. </p><p> Asked for his advice for the next generation of marine biologists, he said: \"Don't give up. You may feel like you are alone, fighting the system. But you are not alone, there are many people out there with you. Not all of them are scientists, but they are also with you in advocating for marine conservation.\" </p><p> Having watched the decline and resurrection of the country's reefs, Prof Chou remains optimistic about their future.</p><p> \"When I first started in coral reef research, many people were talking about how coral reefs are fragile, break easily, and (are) unable to handle large disturbances. But that's not the case for our reefs, and going forward, with new technology and new science, anything is possible.\"  </p><p> Audrey Tan is the science communications lead at the National University of Singapore's Tropical Marine Science Institute.

Furthermore, we look forward to expanding bilateral research collaboration - including between the U.S. National Science Foundation and AI Singapore - with a focus on AI safety and security and to enhance workforce development efforts.</p><p>Digital Economy and Data Governance:The United States and Singapore will harness technology to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth. The two countries intend to develop a bilateral Roadmap for Digital Economic Cooperation that charts common principles and objectives on priority issues such as data governance, digital standards, digital inclusion, consumer protection, and ensuring small- and medium-enterprises can benefit from opportunities in the digital economy. We will also continue to work within the IPEF to make the digital economy more innovative and equitable. The United States and Singapore share an interest in facilitating trusted data flows with effective privacy protections. Through the existing Partnership for Growth and Innovation, the two sides commit to continued collaboration to promote these goals, including through the expansion of the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules Forum. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Monetary Authority of Singapore will convene a meeting with relevant officials across our governments on both sides to explore how to strengthen our bilateral collaboration on digital payments, sharing information on our respective approaches with a view toward working together to shape international best practices. Finally, the United States and Singapore will seek to cooperate in a more concerted fashion in relevant regional and multilateral fora, and in international standards-setting bodies, to advance our shared digital economy objectives.</p><p>Biotechnology:The United States is committed to building strong security, privacy, and ethical standards around DNA sequencing data, storage, and research to ensure the use of these data are consistent with our norms and secure against cyber intrusion and other malign activities.The United States and Singapore recognize the vital importance of furtheringthe development of safe and secure biotechnologies, and their ethical use in line with internationally accepted principles and norms. The two countries intend to convene our science agencies to advance shared research and development priorities, including in synthetic biology, cell and gene therapeutics, and genetic delivery systems. We will also convene universities, research institutions, private sectors, and governance agencies to drive new talent exchanges and connect our start-up communities to exchangebest practices around commercialization, scaling, and R&amp;D translation efforts.</p><p>Critical Infrastructure and Technology Supply Chains:The two countries commit to advance focused collaboration toward promoting secure and resilient information and communications technology infrastructure-including telecommunications networks, undersea cables, and cloud computing-in the United States, Singapore, and partner nations.
