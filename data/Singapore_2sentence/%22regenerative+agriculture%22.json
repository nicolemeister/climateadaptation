They are deeply intertwined. They're actually not three different markets-they're really one challenge we face in the shifting ecology of the planet.</p><p>That challenge of global warming, water scarcity (and) the fact that the global water cycle is out of kilter, and the progressive loss of biodiversity, are reinforcing each other. And they now form a vicious cycle. If we don't manage water well-if we let soil health deteriorate, lose moisture in the soil, and degrade the wetlands-we also reduce carbon sequestration, which accelerates global warming. And global warming then dries the soil, leads to further problems with the forests, and you get that vicious cycle. So, we are dealing with something that the science is very clear on, but it must be reflected in our governance approaches, our policies, and our financing strategies. Including one of the important areas of potential, which is in developing the market for credits. Just like we've got carbon credits, we need to develop the market for water credits and biodiversity credits. I'll come back to that in a moment.</p><p>Nature-based solutions are an extremely important part of climate change mitigation. You can argue about exactly what percentage of mitigation should come down to nature-based solutions, but we know that there's much good that arises from nature-based solutions. It's not just about reducing carbon emissions or capturing more carbon, but also about the co-benefits of nature-based solutions: reducing heat, reducing the spread of diseases, and a whole set of other benefits.</p><p>But think of nature-based solutions not just in terms of carbon. Think of nature-based solutions as a way of managing water, reducing carbon emissions, and preserving biodiversity. Because when you put them together, the ripple effects give them a much larger impact.</p><p>To give you an example. We need to transform the agri-food industry. Regenerative agriculture, which is already well underway in many parts of the world, will help preserve soil health, preserve carbon in the soil, and improve yields with appropriate incentives and technologies. They help farmers and consumers. And you have to remember that the agri-food industry is also the biggest source of deforestation and the loss of biodiversity.</p><p>Think of rice, which is a major issue in Asia especially, but also in some other parts of the world. We have to move, fundamentally, from the predominant system of rice cultivation-the flooding of padi fields, which leads to high methane emissions, farmers pumping water from underground using energy, and a significant amount of water being wasted.</p><p>With more sustainable rice production-using techniques like direct seeding of rice, and alternate wetting and drying, you can save 50 percent of methane emissions, 30 percent of water, and some 60 percent of energy. And improve yields at the same time. So, it's an example of how you can address several problems at the same time.</p><p>This brings me to financing, because nature-based solutions are significantly underfunded. It's rested largely on governments. The private sector is still at the nascent stage of getting into nature-based investments as a way of addressing climate change.</p><p>The carbon credits market already has an ecosystem. There are integrity issues and greenwashing issues, but improvements are being made. The ICVCM, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Markets, and the SBTI, the Science-Based Targets Initiative, and others -there's a lot of good work taking place to improve integrity and trust in the markets. And I believe this is going to be a significant source of financing for nature-based solutions.</p><p>Now, we can't-I think it will be very difficult-to create a whole ecosystem for sustainable water credits, and biodiversity credits, side by side with carbon credits. It can be done in theory, but it's going to exhaust the private sector, and it's going to exhaust negotiators.</p><p>Much better that we work on a reliable carbon credit system. And have water and biodiversity credits stapled on. They are still in their infancy. There are biodiversity credits that are currently being stapled on, but it's being done qualitatively because we don't yet have precise, quantitative ways of assessing biodiversity benefits in a way that can be compared across different projects, regions, and geographies.</p><p>In other words, there's no common currency. But even the qualitative approach has led to a premium on carbon credits that have biodiversity stapled onto it. We can do the same with water.</p><p>And remember: water will not just enhance the value of the carbon credits. The benefits of sustainable water practices can be reaped earlier and in a way that local communities see as benefiting themselves. It's not just for the markets-people see the benefits.</p><p>I think the WEF should work with other coalitions to develop some rigor in this process. How do we develop the biodiversity and water credit markets? And ideally, from a practical point of view, how do we then staple them onto carbon credits in a new, high-integrity, nature-based carbon credits market?</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: The Istana, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["Key Highlights:* President Tharman Shanmugaratnam highlighted the interconnectedness of global warming, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss as a single challenge. * Emphasized the need for nature-based solutions in climate change mitigation, including developing markets for water credits and biodiversity credits.

Internationally acclaimed for its quality, Araku Coffee has also reached more than 42 countries, including South Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States.This journey began in 2000, in the lush, biodiverse Araku Valley, located on the borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Here, the Naandi Foundation, an India-based social enterprise that tackles poverty, started working with the local Adivasi tribal communities. Conscious of the communities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unique cultural and historical heritage, the Naandi Foundation focused on understanding the communities and their environment, gradually introducing regenerative agriculture practices. </p><p>By 2005, the tribal farmers of Araku Valley were growing and improving the quality of their coffee crops with the support of the foundation. These farmers were provided with nutrient-rich compost, which made the fragile soil more fertile. The biodiverse terroir, combined with organic farming, resulted in coffee cherries with a natural sweetness and delicate fruity and floral aromas. Coffee cultivation also provided year-round employment and better incomes for over 45,000 Adivasi families, marking the beginning of a sustainable livelihood. Becoming self-sustainingWithin 10 to 15 years, the valley transformed into the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest tribal organic coffee farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cooperative. The cooperative now has over 40,000 members, holds democratic elections, and has an executive body with 50 per cent women. Massive annual forest festivals are held, which have resulted in the planting of 49 million trees, further enhancing the environmental benefits of shade-grown coffee. This type of coffee helps afforestation as it provides habitats for birds, which naturally prey on pests, reduces soil erosion and offers protection for the coffee trees. Arakunomics, a sustainable economic model developed by Naandi Foundation, underpins this transformation. It focuses on empowering farmers, improving livelihoods, and protecting the environment. This model has been so impactful that it earned the Rockefeller Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Food System Vision Prize in 2020 and the Institute of Food Technologists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Seeding the Future Prize in 2023. Apart from coffee, the tribal farmers and their families are also growing other crops such as pepper, paddy, pulses and millets using the same organic regenerative agricultural methods. Arakunomics is now being replicated in other parts of India with complex agrarian challenges, such as Maharashtra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vidarbha region, Punjab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s groundwater-depleted districts, and forgotten border areas in northern Uttar Pradesh. From humble bean to specialty cup Today, Araku Coffee has consistently high scores of above 90 out of 100 on the industry-recognised specialty coffee scale. Specialty coffee scores 80 points or more on the scale. In the Araku Valley, over 20,000 farmer families come together for the Gems of Araku, an annual harvest festival that celebrates that season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffee microlots and the farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 contributions to creating world-class specialty coffee. Each season, over 1,800 micro-lots are evaluated by professional coffee cuppers using international cupping protocols. Since 2009, this event has consistently helped improve coffee quality, farm and processing practices. Farmers are continually learning about their coffee terroirs to improve coffee bush health, build soil organic carbon, and regenerate the Araku Coffee landscape. And the proof is in the cup. As the soils get richer and the coffee produces more complex flavour notes, the coffee score becomes higher, with top micro-lots achieving scores as high as 94 out of 100.Buoyed by the success of the Paris cafe, Araku opened a first-of-its-kind large-format cafe in Bengaluru, India, in 2021, serving as both a coffee haven and an interactive cultural space.

Well over 100,000 people have been subject to mandatory evacuation orders, while early estimates have put the likely insured losses at US$20 billion and the potential overall economic loss as high as US$57 billion. Quantifying the human suffering and emotional loss is impossible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> While the cause of the fires is yet to be established, it is likely that last year's heavy rains from the El Nino weather system fuelled vegetation growth, which has since dried during a recent prolonged dry spell. Combined with strong winds, this has created the ideal conditions for wildfires to spread. </p><p> The broader science is clear -- climate change and today's methods of landscape management are accelerating the wildfire risk globally. </p><p> A key challenge in California -- as also in the Mediterranean, which too has seen a rising threat from wildfires in recent years -- is the rural-urban interface where the town meets the countryside, with a disproportionate number of residences now located in high wildfire-risk areas. </p><p> Holistic strategies neededAs residential areas expand deeper into wilderness, the risk to homes and businesses rises. It is estimated that, globally, insurance claims due to wildfires have risen to US$10 billion annually, a figure that now looks set to be dwarfed in 2025. Indeed, many homeowners caught up in the LA fires are without home insurance, after insurers hiked costs or simply cancelled provision altogether in recent years due to the escalating wildfire risks.</p><p> In addition to urban spread, climate change and the way we plan and manage our landscapes are thought to be the key factors. </p><p> As temperatures rise, and droughts become more frequent, the tinderbox conditions that spark and spread wildfires are increasingly common. </p><p> Across the world, this new generation of wildfires are exceeding our capacity to suppress them. As we face mounting environmental, economic and social threats, we must move from tactical suppression to holistic mitigation-adaptation strategies, to minimise the risk of extreme fires breaking out, and create resilient landscapes that are capable of recovering quickly should a fire occur. </p><p> Recent years have seen substantial scientific and technical advances in how land management practices can integrate prevention-preparedness, detection-response, and restoration-adaptation. </p><p> Climate-smart forestry, for instance, which puts resilience and climate benefits at the forefront of forest management, is emerging as an effective tool for creating landscapes that are resilient to wildfires and other extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. </p><p> One major issue, however, is -- how do we finance these strategies'</p><p> The key to achieving this goal is the growth of the circular bioeconomy -- in essence, by replacing today's extractive, fossil-based economy with an economy based on nature's regenerative power, we can cut the emissions that lead to global heating and reduce the risk of extreme weather events while attracting the necessary investments to transform landscapes and businesses in an integrated manner. At the local level, the bioeconomy flourishes where nature thrives, meaning that economic growth goes hand in hand with the creation of healthy, biodiverse, climate- and fire-resilient landscapes.</p><p> Forests and agroforestry, with their multifunctional roles and wide range of ecosystem services, offer great opportunities to build this new economic model. New technologies are creating unprecedented opportunities to transform plant-based compounds into many of the fossil-based materials we use today, including construction materials, textiles, plastics, and chemicals. Managing forests to produce these resources regeneratively also enhances the ecosystem services that forests provide, improving carbon sequestration, soil health, and water retention, and reducing a forest's susceptibility to fire. </p><p> The same can be said for agroforestry and regenerative farming, which provide us with food while enhancing ecosystem services. </p><p> This is not the case in conventional agriculture, which provides food while generating environmental externalities.</p><p> Seize the opportunity As the bioeconomy grows, so does the economic opportunity. In the Amazon alone, the bioeconomy could be worth up to US$4 trillion, while globally the bioeconomy is expected to be valued at US$7.7 trillion by 2030.</p><p> For investors, the growth of the circular bioeconomy is creating an opportunity for private finance and public-private partnerships to target returns while creating fire-resistant and resilient landscapes through nature-based solutions, such as regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and sustainable forestry, which can target better long-term economic profits and a rise in land values while enhancing biodiversity- and water-, soil- and climate-related ecosystem services. </p><p> Whether this is through companies that are turning monoculture coffee plantations into healthy agroforests, producing coffee that sells at a premium, grown on climate-resilient farms that sequester more carbon than they emit, or carbon and biodiversity credit markets that give investors the chance to target sustainable returns and diversify their portfolios, opportunities abound. However, to bring these and other mechanisms to scale, innovative financial tools will be needed. </p><p> Think out of the boxFrom real asset strategies that deploy capital to transform degraded or non-adapted land assets to resilient and regenerative assets, to schemes such as the Australian Emissions Reduction Fund, and the USA's Forest Resilience Bond -- which allows private capital to play a role in public land management -- such mechanisms must become the norm rather than the exception. </p><p> To do that, the finance industry needs to build a better understanding of the key role of nature as the true engine of our economy. Bringing scientific experts to the investment and finance industry needs to be the norm in the coming years.</p><p> In a world where losses from environmental disasters are growing -- in total, climate disasters cost the global economy US$320 billion in 2024 -- urgent action is needed, and investors have an essential role to play. </p><p> As we search for new ways to finance the fight against wildfires, we must take a multifaceted approach, integrating science, finance and policy to build a circular bioeconomy that addresses the root causes of extreme events. </p><p> In today's era of climate change, we must take our lead from nature and build resilience from the ground up. </p><p> The writer is chief nature officer at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.

But anecdotally, the bank has seen \"strong interest\" among the next generation of family office leaders in environmental causes, he added. </p><p> For example, DBS Foundation -- which supports businesses that help or make an impact on vulnerable communities -- had supported social enterprise Phool from India, which collects floral waste from the Ganges River to create a sustainable alternative to leather, dubbed Fleather. </p><p> This material was featured during Paris Fashion Week, Mr Lee said, and it won a strong following among some of the family offices managed by the bank. \"The massive opportunities created by investments into such sustainable investments are drawing more family offices to review and step up their support in this regard,\" he added. </p><p> Silverstrand's Mr Chiu agreed, saying: \"In South-east Asia, there is growing momentum in impact investing with the emergence of more first-generation family offices, driven by younger, entrepreneurial founders who embrace the concept of profit with purpose.\" </p><p> Impact investments are the most effective way to create long-lasting, positive change at scale, he noted. \"We believe that for the impact to be enduring, the solution must also be financially self-sustaining,\" he said. \"There is a new generation of impact entrepreneurs looking to do good and do well, and it is up to us as investors to support them in their journey.\" </p><p> Profit-with-purpose philosophy aside, Mr Lee from DBS said research has shown that over the longer term, stocks with strong environmental, social and governance scores outperformed the larger benchmark index. </p><p> Moreover, as national policies evolve in favour of greater disclosure of climate and nature-related risks and opportunities, with greater clarity on what sustainable financing entails, the trend of an increasing interest in sustainable investments looks set to continue, he added. </p><p> Asked if such investments made by family offices will have cascading effects on the economy, Mr Lee said their investments have a longer-term strategic impact. </p><p> \"The many ultra-high-net-worth families we have spoken to have shared with us that capital will make the most impact if there is a network in place to make connections,\" he said. </p><p> \"The choice of Singapore as a preferred hotbed for partnerships and collaboration will create continuous... inflows of deep talent and new investors or family offices who would choose Singapore as their hub, which will, in turn, translate into sustained growth in new pockets within the financial and associated support sectors in Singapore.\" </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["In a video address aired on April 16 at Ecosperity Week -- a sustainability conference convened by global investment company Temasek -- International Union for Conservation of Nature president Razan Al Mubarak said: \"We need to redirect financial flows from activities that harm nature towards those that protect, restore and sustain nature. \"It is imperative that non-state actors, businesses, financial institutions, cities and regions embrace this paradigm shift by placing nature at the forefront of climate action and strategic agendas.

Private credit and other forms of non-bank credit represent approximately 20% of the total Asia credit market, as compared to 65% in North America, according to Vijay Padmanabhan, managing director of credit investments at Cambridge Associates, in the fund management company's Asia Insights report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Fundraising by Asia-based private credit funds amounted to just 5% of total capital raised by global private credit funds in the trailing five years ending 2023,\" Padmanabhan continues. As banks step back from lending to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises without a credit rating, and which are not investment-grade due to regulatory requirements, private lenders could step in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Private credit is where a non-bank lender provides loans to companies. In a portfolio, which is mainly divided between bonds and equities with a small allocation to the private markets, private credit can serve as a diversifier in a private markets portfolio as debt is less correlated with equity markets.</p><p>Returns are achieved by charging a floating rate spread above the reference rate, allowing the lender and investors to benefit from increasing interest rates. Unlike private equity, private credit agreements have a fixed term, meaning that the \"exit strategy\" for an investment is pre-defined.</p><p>Matthieu Chabran, co-founder of Tikehau Capital, says he has no issues about a lack of private credit deals in Asia. \"Private credit is quite active. Lending by the banks in the mid-cap space is less active and there is real room for a private lender like us.\"</p><p>The downside to real estate</p><p>Tikehau describes itself as a global alternative asset management group with EUR46.1 billion ($65.8 billion) of assets under management (AUM), as at June 30. Although it invests across four asset classes - private debt, real assets, private equity and capital markets - its largest sector appears to be private credit. Of the EUR46.1 billion, EUR23 billion is in private credit. Roughly, that comprises direct lending in Europe, direct lending in Asia, and secondary private credit (leverage loans) in the US.</p><p>\"The market in Asia is really narrow. We invest in real estate debt in Europe and the US, and soon to be in Asia; and what we call 'special opportunity' is all the rest,\" Chabran says.</p><p>Most of the investment - although Tikehau does not break it down publicly- is in real estate, Chabran says. \"Mainly it's credit; mainly it's real estate,\" he clarifies.</p><p>\"If someone owns real estate, we can lean on the real estate and be a first lien mortgage lender; at times, we can lend to a company, and in order to secure the debt, they give us security on the real estate. It's a combination of both, but that's where our debt team and the real estate team work very well together,\" Chabran explains.</p><p>\"This EUR23 billion [private credit AUM] is our largest business. Then comes the second largest business, effectively real estate and infrastructure for EUR18 billion, and that includes private equity and real estate. That's us buying a building, or buying a stake in IREIT Global which happens to be a listed REIT, but it's underlying real estate,\" Chabran says. Tikehau's main assets are in France and Germany, according to him.</p><p>It is noteworthy, though, that IREIT's performance has been patchy. In FY2023, distributions per unit (DPU) fell by 30.5% y-o-y to 1.87 EUR cents due to factors including dilapidation costs, rent-free periods for new tenants, and an enlarged unit base. Tikehau, through its 50% stake in IREIT's manager, is able to collect fees, including following the divestment of properties in its funds to the REIT. On the other hand, IREIT's unitholders suffered dilutions to DPU via equity fundraising and a challenging commercial property sector.</p><p>\"The real estate portfolio we're focusing on has always been fairly agnostic: retail, office, lodging, hotels, residential. We love residential. We did a big transaction in Portugal not too long ago; we bought 4,500 flats. We look at real estate as a credit instrument,\" Chabran says.</p><p>For instance, sale-and-leaseback works for Tikehau. \"We just closed two transactions in Europe with some large corporates because they have their own debt issues to manage.\" These corporates sold their properties to Tikehau and leased them back for 12 years. \"They see it as freeing up some cash which can be addressed to manage their liabilities and taking a long-term lease liability, one that enabled them to effectively reset their capital structure,\" Chabran explains.</p><p>These debt investments enable Tikehau to record a 10% to 12% unlevered return. \"We love that for our balance sheet,\" he adds. Among the deals he likes is grocery retail, which is a defensive asset in places like Europe and North America.</p><p>With returns in the low teens, \"even if you're an insurance company, a sovereign wealth fund, or family office, with too much real estate, they like it because it's a recurring cash flow\", Chabran points out.</p><p>On the private equity front, Tikehau focuses on energy transition, regenerative agriculture and cybersecurity. \"In private equity, we don't do leveraged buyouts. We do growth equity, expansion capital, defined as entrepreneurs, families, founders. They have a good business, but they need to scale this business. They want a partner who's going to be investing some capital in to help them grow and scale their business,\" Chabran says.</p><p>More recently, Tikehau opened an office in Hong Kong. Chabran is reluctant to provide details on Tikehau's plans in Hong Kong except to say: \"We see [Hong Kong] as a great opportunity.\"</p><p>In April, Tikehau announced a partnership with Flow Capital, a Hong Kong alternatives fund manager. \"We haven't done any transactions yet. We're going to take a bit of time. When you are new in a country, the first transactions that you see are not necessarily the best ones,\" Chabran acknowledges.</p><p>Australia, South Korea are credit-friendly</p><p>According to Cambridge Associates, investment managers focused on private credit are increasingly pivoting to developed Asia markets such as Australia and South Korea, which are credit-friendly jurisdictions in which banks are retrenching and high-quality collateral is available.</p><p>\"The presence of higher sponsor activity in these markets creates space for sponsor-backed lending opportunities, while credit opportunities in sectors such as real estate are also rising given a trend of tightening liquidity from traditional lenders,\" Padmanabhan says.</p><p>In his view, India is a bright spot for managers in the emerging market space, because of its resilient economic growth outlook, improving credit regulations, and credit landscape. \"India private credit had predominantly leaned towards distressed credit due to its legacy non-performing asset challenges and, more recently, in the aftermath of its NBFC [non-bank financial company] liquidity crisis. However, the strategies have since broadened to include performing credits in the underserved, mid-market segment, and solution capital to businesses for share buybacks and growth or acquisition financing,\" Padmanabhan says.</p><p>Lower penetration and competition today create a compelling environment for Asia private credit strategies, as these allow for deals to be executed at better terms, pricing, and covenants, Padmanabhan adds.</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Singapore", "instances": ["Among the deals he likes is grocery retail, which is a defensive asset in places like Europe and North America.

Bird flu, African swine fever, droughts, floods and other disruptions created significant uncertainty for a country reliant on protein imports. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore's dilemma is far from unique. Global trends such as population growth, urbanisation and diminishing natural resources mean that other countries also need innovative ways to make more with less. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Alternative proteins -- an emerging field that harnesses protein from plants, cell cultivation or fermentation -- could potentially deliver the flavours and nutrition that consumers crave, in a more secure and sustainable way.  </p><p> On Sept 5, the National University of Singapore (NUS) announced it will be opening a new Bezos Centre for Sustainable Protein, funded by a US$30 million (S$39 million) investment from the Bezos Earth Fund, one of the world's leading climate philanthropies. </p><p> The centre will focus on all three pillars of alternative proteins and serve as a launch pad to pioneer new technologies, formulations and manufacturing techniques that can enable large-scale commercialisation. </p><p> It will also create a wide array of new jobs and cement Singapore's position as a regional and global leader in food innovation. </p><p>Singapore has played a central role in funding the critical research and development to get \"future foods\" off the ground, investing roughly 24 times as much public funding into protein innovation as a percentage of gross domestic product as the United States and many other tech hubs. </p><p> The Republic also worked to build a comprehensive safety approval framework for novel foods.</p><p> Those moves bore early fruit in 2020 when Singapore became the first country to approve commercial sales of cultivated meat -- more than two years before the US. </p><p> Overcoming pain pointsInspired by Singapore's rapid progress, global media outlets trumpeted a forthcoming food revolution, prompting a surge of new interest from investors who feared missing the boat. </p><p> Between 2020 and 2021, equity financing for the alternative protein sector doubled, reaching US$5.6 billion, and hopes ran high that quick returns were right around the corner.</p><p> That didn't happen. </p><p> While alternative protein innovators continued to make steady progress scaling up manufacturing and driving down costs, it soon became clear that the road to mainstream commercialisation was going to be longer than initial estimates theorised. </p><p> When a global economic downturn prompted a fresh round of belt-tightening, investors who jumped on the bandwagon to make a quick buck leapt right back off and food tech investments tumbled precipitously. </p><p> As disenchanted venture capitalists pulled back, misinformation spread on social media and start-up stock values fell off a cliff. In the press, rumours of the plant-based meat sector's death were greatly exaggerated.  </p><p> Yet, despite a wave of scepticism, Singapore's leaders remained confident that their early bets would pay off.</p><p> The Economic Development Board told The Straits Times in March that the agri-food sector's outlook \"remains strong, given rising food demand and increasingly stressed supply chains\". </p><p> An eye on Asia The NUS centre is one of three new facilities established by the Bezos Earth Fund to resolve alternative protein pain points around the world, the others being at Imperial College London and North Carolina State University. </p><p> All three are part of the Earth Fund's US$1 billion commitment to transforming food systems, which are responsible for about one-third of all global emissions, according to the World Bank. </p><p> Research shows that decoupling protein production from animal agriculture not only reduces zoonotic disease risk, but also facilitates abundance by eliminating the inefficiency of feeding up to 40 calories of crops to a cow to get back just one calorie of beef. </p><p> By streamlining food production, alternative proteins can reduce the amount of land needed to feed the human population by as much as 75 per cent, freeing up about three billion hectares for ecological restoration, renewable energy and regenerative agriculture. </p><p> Cultivated and plant-based proteins also slash meat's greenhouse gas emissions by up to 92 per cent and 98 per cent, respectively, making them essential tools in the global shift towards decarbonisation. </p><p> Through targeted research, the Bezos centres will collaboratively explore potential technological breakthroughs and tackle key bottlenecks such as the bioproduction efficiency of alternative protein materials (producing high-quality ingredients in larger quantities at lower prices), safety and risk assessments, consumer perception challenges, workforce development and Asia-focused nutritional research. </p><p> Studies show that ramping up the nutritional benefits of plant-based meat is among the biggest potential levers to increase purchases among mainstream South-east Asian consumers, second only to reducing costs. </p><p> Much of the centre's research will be free to access, thus liberating start-ups from engaging in duplicative R&amp;D and empowering food innovators to refocus on what they do best: crafting and scaling up production of delicious products.</p><p> The Bezos Earth Fund's investments will boost the entire industry rather than any single company, providing a much-needed shot in the arm for the global alternative protein sector, which, despite Singapore's best efforts, remains woefully underfunded relative to its food security potential. </p><p> An assessment by the non-profit ClimateWorks Foundation and Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office estimated that making alternative proteins commercially successful will require US$10.1 billion in public investment every year. For comparison, total government funding worldwide in 2023 was only US$523 million -- 5 per cent of what's necessary. </p><p> The NUS centre -- which will bring together experts from across NUS, as well as ETH Zurich, Nanyang Technological University and the Singapore Institute of Technology -- can help close that gap, not by supplanting public funds, but by resolving fundamental scientific challenges that have driven some companies to the brink of bankruptcy and kept apprehensive governments sitting on the sidelines. </p><p> Cultivated seafood start-ups, for example, have historically faced acute R&amp;D hurdles in scaling up their operations because the aquatic animals their cells are obtained from live in the deep ocean, where oxygen and pressure levels are different from on land. </p><p> This means that much of the existing research on growing cells from terrestrial animals is of limited use, forcing every cultivated seafood company to invest some of its finite funds into conducting costly in-house R&amp;D. Open-access research, by comparison, lifts all boats. </p><p> By constructing a stronger foundation for the alternative protein ecosystem to build on, Singapore now has the opportunity to further boost confidence in the sector's long-term viability and spur other countries to dive in. </p><p> The Bezos Earth Fund investment follows a year-long search that included competing submissions from dozens of top-tier research hubs, which were rigorously reviewed by an independent committee of subject-matter experts.</p><p> In the end, Singapore's unwavering commitment to alternative protein research and NUS' research expertise helped seal the deal for the university. </p><p> NUS will now seek to unlock what ClimateWorks estimates could be US$700 billion in economic growth over the coming decades, as the need for more secure and resilient protein sources grows more urgent. </p><p> Research by environmental, social and governance firm Asia Research and Engagement (ARE) shows that under a business-as-usual scenario, inefficient protein production now risks derailing ambitious emissions reduction goals across the continent. </p><p> Successfully decarbonising Asia's protein supply, ARE warned, will require peaking industrial animal production within the next six years, while simultaneously scaling up alternatives to conventional meat, dairy and eggs. By 2060, alternative proteins need to account for more than half of all protein production by volume.</p><p> In other words, this is a time to lean in, not pull back. </p><p> Mr Jeff Bezos' decision to green-light the launch of a world-class research centre in the Lion City represents a strong vote of confidence in the Republic's vision for a safer, more secure protein supply in Asia and beyond. </p><p> The challenges ahead are substantial and time is not on our side, but by bringing Singapore's brightest minds together to unleash the climate-mitigation potential of \"future foods\", NUS could reignite humanity's hope for a better tomorrow, fuel domestic economic growth, and help sustainable proteins finally achieve escape velocity. </p><p> Ms Mirte Gosker is managing director of the Good Food Institute Apac, Asia's alternative protein think-tank.

Scope 3 emissions -- which refer to indirect emissions arising from a company's supply chain -- fell 51 per cent.</p><p> Scope 1 emissions refer to direct greenhouse-gas emissions released through activity at a facility level, while Scope 2 emissions refer to those released at the power station for the generation of electricity that a company consumes.</p><p> In March last year, Kering updated its sustainability targets to reduce emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 40 per cent by 2035. </p><p> Given that 83 per cent of Kering's environmental footprint is tied to its supply chain, Daveu recognises that the bulk of her responsibility lies in tackling the sourcing and processing of raw materials, as well as the production of items. </p><p> Three strategiesShe laid out three strategies Kering has embarked on to meet the targets: fair production, new circular economy business models and the sourcing of raw materials.  </p><p> Fair production involves using artificial intelligence to make better predictions of sales, so the company can produce just the right amount to meet demand. </p><p> As for the circular economy strategy, Kering has invested in Vestiaire Collective -- an online marketplace for second-hand luxury fashion.</p><p> It has been 15 years since its inception in 2009, and Vestiaire Collective has not achieved profitability; but it has announced plans to be profitable by the end of the year. It launched a crowdfunding campaign in January 2024. </p><p> It is the third leg of the strategy -- lowering the carbon footprint of its raw materials -- that would possibly have the biggest impact on Kering's emissions. </p><p> Daveu said the company is looking to scale up various pilot projects it is working on in sustainable sourcing. </p><p> One example is regenerative agriculture. This involves cotton or animal farming that restores soil health through rotational cropping or grazing, protecting biodiversity, eliminating the use of synthetic inputs and ensuring farmers are paid fairly for improved practices. </p><p> Another is the innovation of disruptive raw materials. Examples of these include the use of mycelium -- the root-like structure of a fungus -- to make vegan leather. Kering is working with more than 250 startups that look at the research and development of raw materials.</p><p> When asked if Kering has any timeline on the increased incorporation of sustainable raw materials into its supply chain, Daveu said that the nature of innovation makes it hard to predict when the company can scale the implementation of such projects.</p><p> In addition, the quality bar these raw materials have to pass to justify a luxury price point adds an additional layer of complexity. </p><p> \"You have to be sure, of course, about the quality. You have to be sure about the fact that you will have security in the volume. And third, the price for the raw materials,\" said Daveu. </p><p> Mix of materialsShe believes that the company will eventually use a mix of disruptive raw materials, and conventional ones sourced from regenerative agricultural practices. </p><p> Kering's targets to reduce absolute emissions by 2035 are a tall order. The company's total emissions for 2023 came in at 1.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Although this was a decline from 2.4 million tonnes in 2022, it was partly driven by a 4 per cent decrease in its revenue in 2023. </p><p> Unlike its competitor LVMH and Hermes, which reported year-on-year growth in sales, customer disaffection for Gucci -- which is Kering's biggest brand -- led the company to warn profits would fall as much as 45 per cent in the first half of 2024. </p><p> When asked how Kering would navigate the dual challenges of sustainability and declining revenue, Daveu said she was not in a position to comment on the company's financial position. </p><p> \"The main point is to have a de-correlation between the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and the growth of business and profitability. Of course, we are a company, and we have to continue to grow and to increase our profitability. But we are in luxury. So the growth is not linked with volume. It's about the quality and elevation of the brands, new experiences,\" she added. </p><p> She believes that initial investments into sustainability, however, will eventually lead to lower costs. Factories or tanneries that are more efficient would lower energy and water consumption, for example.</p><p> Nonetheless, Daveu said sustainability will not give Kering a competitive edge over its other luxury rivals. </p><p> \"All our best practices, we open-source them. We don't keep only for ourselves because we don't see sustainability as a competitive advantage,\" she said. </p><p> \"We see sustainability really as an enabler to continue to develop the business.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["It is the third leg of the strategy -- lowering the carbon footprint of its raw materials -- that would possibly have the biggest impact on Kering's emissions.

But Katie became very ill,\" Mr Collins recalls.</p><p> In her 20s, Ms Forrest began experiencing chronic digestive issues and knee inflammation that was so severe, doctors said she would eventually need a knee replacement.</p><p> Thinking it would help, the couple doubled down on the plant-based approach and went on a raw vegan diet. \"But things got worse,\" says Mr Collins.</p><p> A nutritionist suggested they try eating meat again and, feeling like they had nothing to lose, they embarked on a paleo-style diet, which emphasises whole, unprocessed foods including animal proteins and non-starchy vegetables, and eschews grains and sugar.</p><p> Ms Forrest's stomach and knee problems cleared up within weeks. Convinced of the health value of animal foods, the couple launched a company called Epic Provisions in 2013.</p><p> Its main products -- snack bars made with ethically sourced, high-quality meat -- were a hit, heralding the now-ubiquitous trend of snack foods touted as high-protein or low-carb.</p><p> In 2016, the couple sold the company to multinational food giant General Mills for a reported US$100 million, and turned their hand to regenerative farming -- an extension of their commitment to ethical and sustainable meat. </p><p> They bought a depleted plot of farmland on the outskirts of picturesque Fredericksburg, a town in central Texas.</p><p> Today, that land is teeming with life -- not just bison, but also pigs, ducks, turkeys, chickens and geese, all pasture-raised, as well as countless birds, insects and all manner of plants.</p><p> When they bought the plot in 2017, the soil was barren -- the legacy of conventional farming techniques such as persistent tilling, overgrazing and monoculture row-cropping.</p><p> This is precisely why it was chosen by the couple, who also built a gorgeous, sprawling home on the land, where they now live with daughters Scout and Wren, who are seven and two.</p><p> \"We didn't want to start with the most pristine property, so we intentionally found one of the worst pieces we could get our hands on, so we could show the land's capacity for healing through regenerative practices.\" </p><p> That is where the bison came in.</p><p> As a keystone species, the bison set off a chain of events that rejuvenate the whole ecosystem, whether they are fertilising the soil with their dung or spreading seeds stuck in their coats as they wallow in the dirt to cool off -- which also creates pools of water that attract smaller creatures.</p><p> This is how the couple transformed the soil at Roam Ranch and made it fertile again in less than two years.</p><p> Worldwide, the extent of soil degradation is debatable.</p><p> In 2014, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation reported that global soils were degrading so quickly, there might be only 60 years' worth of harvests left.</p><p> That statement has been challenged by some, including Dr Hannah Ritchie, a senior researcher who studies global food systems at the University of Oxford.</p><p> In a 2021 report for the science website Our World In Data, she wrote that while some soils are eroding quickly and 16 per cent are expected to be gone within 100 years, half of all soils still have a lifespan of more than 1,000 years.</p><p> But she does concede that soil thinning is a concern, and can be mitigated by better agricultural practices such as no-till farming or growing cover crops.</p><p> These are core practices at regenerative farms such as Roam Ranch, which also implements rotational grazing, where livestock are periodically herded from one pasture to another.</p><p> This mimics the natural movements of such animals in the wild -- when they would naturally move with the seasons, or to escape predators -- and ensures that the grass and soil have time to recover.</p><p> It avoids the overgrazing associated with concentrated animal-feeding operations -- also known as factory farms -- where animals raised for meat, dairy or eggs are kept in confined spaces for a good chunk of their lives.</p><p> Regenerative farming also shines a light on the role of grasslands, which are often overlooked as a carbon sink compared with forests, even though they may be a more reliable way to sequester carbon long term -- for instance, in areas where forest fires release carbon back into the atmosphere.</p><p> And unlike forests, most of the carbon that grasslands sequester from the atmosphere is channelled into organic matter that directly boosts soil fertility.</p><p> Near the perimeter of their ranch, Mr Collins and Ms Forrest point out the stark contrast between their grass and the neighbouring farm's, which is visibly thinner from continuous grazing.</p><p> \"And we have more than five times the animals they have,\" Mr Collins adds.</p><p> The animals on both farms are entirely grass-fed -- a healthier diet compared with the conventional method of feeding cattle and bison grain for the last few months of their lives to boost weight and marbling.</p><p> \"But while grass-fed is better for the animals, it isn't always better for the land,\" Mr Collins says.</p><p> \"What we're trying to do with the regenerative approach leaves the land better and stronger. And we get a really healthy herd and really good meat as well,\" he adds.</p><p>  If you have never had it, bison meat is delicious -- leaner than equivalent cuts of beef, full of flavour, and without the gaminess that lamb, venison and elk meat can sometimes have.</p><p> Roam Ranch is one of several regenerative operations that supply Force of Nature, the premium-meat company which Mr Collins and Ms Forrest co-founded in 2019, and whose frozen bison, beef, elk, wild boar and turkey are now stocked by major supermarkets all over the US. </p><p> Serving Force of Nature meat has become a selling point for American restaurants such as the Hopdoddy Burger Bar chain, which promotes its sustainable sourcing.</p><p> Silhouetted against the sweeping pastures of Roam Ranch, the bison herd is cinematically beautiful.</p><p> As a species, they have been around since the last Ice Age, and gazing at their furry, prehistoric faces is like stepping back in time.</p><p> They are impressively resilient as well.</p><p> \"We had a really big snow storm here in Texas a few years ago, and people with beef cows and deer saw them dying left and right,\" Mr Collins says.</p><p> \"But these bison didn't mind it one bit. They thought it was the greatest thing.\"</p><p> There have been many colourful characters at the ranch, including a people-pleasing female named Beyonce and a gargantuan bull, Cecil, which was thrice the size of the rest and very popular with females in the herd.</p><p> Many farmers avoid raising bison because they think they are hard and difficult, says Mr Collins.</p><p> \"But if you give them the resources they need and graze them responsibly, they are just the sweetest, most amazing animals.\" </p><p> The ranch opens its doors to the public a few times a year for tours, hunts and the occasional bison field harvest.</p><p> The harvest offers a rare opportunity to watch one of these creatures being humanely slaughtered. This is followed by a butchering demonstration where participants learn how such a large animal, which can weigh more than 400kg, is broken down.</p><p> They also get to sample fresh bison tartare, and each person is sent home with about 1kg or more of ground bison meat.</p><p> It is not for the squeamish, but Mr Collins and Ms Forrest say the experience is deeply moving and eye-opening, and leaves visitors more grateful for the food on their plates. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["FREDERICKSBURG, Texas -- If you are a lifelong city dweller like I am, chances are, you rarely think about how your food was grown or raised.

You need to go to a leadership position, (which happens) only when you are very, very focused on a particular market,\" said Praneeth Yendamuri, partner at Bain &amp; Company.</p><p> This means competition from larger fast-moving consumer goods companies can pose a challenge for consumer startups here. \"It's like a tug of war for market share,\" he added. </p><p> To compete, said Dymfke Kuijpers, senior partner and global leader of retail at McKinsey &amp; Company, brands need to reshape their social and environmental footprint.</p><p> This can be done by promoting diversity, equity and inclusion; or adopting regenerative agriculture, she added.</p><p> Affordability is also vital for consumers in the current economic climate. Brands can consider expanding their \"essentials\" range to feature competitively priced yet high quality products, said Kuijpers.</p><p> Yendamuri said brands must also tailor their growth strategies to each market segment.</p><p> South-east Asia can be particularly challenging as it is made up of heterogeneous markets. For instance, the silver economy is important in the ageing economies of Singapore and Thailand. Consumer spending power also varies from one country to another, said Yendamuri.</p><p> He added that companies could take advantage of advances in artificial intelligence that have made personalisation easier. Chatbots can support customer service and recommend products and services, for instance.</p><p> In addition, despite the increasing popularity of digital channels such as social media and e-commerce, physical outreach is still important in countries with a large number of traditional trade stores, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, said Yendamuri. </p><p> In spite of the challenges consumer startups face, however, investors and market watchers remain optimistic of the opportunities for venture capital here.</p><p> \"We are in the sweet spot of the consumer world for future growth,\" said DSGCP's Mehta. South-east Asia has one of the world's youngest populations, and is also at an inflection point for per capita income -- discretionary spending will rise exponentially in the next few years, he added.</p><p> The VC firm in October announced the final close of its fourth fund at US$114 million, with 95 per cent of current limited partners (LPs) returning and making up 72 per cent of the capital.</p><p> \"(This is) the best test of commitment -- whether your existing LPs come back,\" said Deepak Shahdadpuri, managing director and founder of DSGCP.</p><p> The exit environment for consumer brands in South-east Asia is becoming more dynamic, with heightened investor interest from private investors and multinational corporations, added Kuijpers.</p><p> \"A successful exit strategy depends on many factors such as timing, negotiation acumen, and market conditions,\" she said. </p><p> \"As South-east Asia's consumer market continues to grow, exit opportunities remain viable for brands demonstrating value and potential.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["\"It's like a tug of war for market share,\" he added.

Instead of being rich and dark, the red soil is barren and desert-like, robbed of nutrients -- scars from the monoculture farming that has taken place on this land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As our group of about 20 walks, Mr Chua urges us to ponder over the state of the degraded soil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We are not just here to learn, but to also observe and feel. Some of us who are more sensitive may feel pain, anger and sadness, wondering why we have done this to our land. But it's okay to let yourself feel as much as possible,\" he says.</p><p> It is the first sign that this is not your usual farm tour. In February, I visited A Little Wild's (ALW) monthly open farm day in Kota Tinggi, a town in Johor, Malaysia. </p><p> Online, the ALW team outlines its plan to transform a 55ha land parcel, which has been a palm oil plantation since the 1980s, into an educational agroforest flourishing with fruits and vegetables. But I did not fully grasp what that meant until my visit.</p><p> A land scarredAs the group traipses through the first plot of palm oil trees, co- founder Imran Hassan, the farm's 38-year-old full-time manager, explains the origins of monoculture farming in industrial agriculture. This refers to the practice of growing one, or a few, crop species at a time.</p><p> Large-scale monoculture plantations were established in South-east Asia by the early capitalist endeavours of European colonists. These ranged from rubber and coffee to tea and palm oil plantations. </p><p> This intensive farming system forces the land into an unnatural state, where yields and uniformity are prized. Farmers use chemicals to kill pests, weeds and organisms in the soil.</p><p> As a result, people are eating very \"stressed fruits\" that rely on costly and resource-intensive methods. Soil is viewed as a lifeless medium, its quality steadily stripped of its natural nutrients and complex life, says Mr Imran, who has worked in various regenerative farms and other projects across South-east Asia since 2010. </p><p> Soil destruction creates a vicious circle. When topsoil deteriorates, it loses its ability to hold carbon below and above ground. This carbon is released into the atmosphere, causing the planet to get hotter. More difficult soil and climate conditions require more chemicals and pesticides to achieve the same yields. </p><p> ALW's guiding ethos is to help the land heal. </p><p> \"Every land dreams of becoming a forest,\" says Mr Chua, one of the farm's four founders along with Mr Imran and two more friends. </p><p> The quartet founded the farm in 2020, coming together through their shared disillusionment with the modern food system. </p><p> They saw food production, in addition to being a cause of chronic diseases, as accelerating biodiversity loss and climate change. </p><p> The land was bought with a goal of showing that regenerative agriculture can be financially viable, and to share their experience and applied research with current and aspiring farmers who want to transform the food production system.</p><p> Mr Chua spends four to five days a week at the farm, where he helps out in the plots, supports the building of new facilities, assists with tours and workshops and manages volunteers. </p><p> A former public servant working in Singapore and civil engineer with a master's degree in public policy, he also co-founded Feed Our Loved Ones (Folo), a community farm in Johor using compost made out of food waste to produce organic vegetables.</p><p> To heal the landALW bills itself as South-east Asia's first commercial-scale syntropic agroforestry farm. This means it does not rely on irrigation, with no agricultural inputs such as chemical fertilisers, weedicides and pesticides.</p><p> Founders draw inspiration from Swiss farmer Ernst Gotsch, who pioneered the syntropic farming movement. This approach mimics natural ecosystems by integrating diverse crops and trees, enhancing soil fertility and biodiversity.</p><p> Having experimented with syntropic agroforestry for the last three years, Mr Chua says this is one of the best nature-based solutions in the tropics to heal soil life -- regenerating forests and drawing down carbon while growing food.</p><p> \"Syntropic agroforestry is a solution that does not require more intense energy and resource extraction because it harnesses the billion-year wisdom of the tropical forest in harvesting the sun, the rain and nutrients to sustain life,\" he explains.</p><p> At ALW, the process looks like this. </p><p> Initially, degraded soil supports only pioneer species, normally known as weeds, such as mimosa, senduduk and lalang. So, farmers choose the best weeds -- typically mombasa grass which regrows fast and produces plenty of biomass (organic matter such as wood, forest residue or plant material) -- to enrich the barren soil. </p><p> From there, the team plants varieties of species in layers, based on their complementary characteristics. Diversity is key, with more than 80 species in every tree row to mimic the stratification, natural succession and dynamics of a biodiverse rainforest.</p><p> Towering above the forest are emergent trees -- such as the acacia, coconut and durian -- which require constant sunlight. </p><p> Next are the canopy trees that do not mind a bit of shade, like the jackfruit or rambutan tree, followed by the medium layer, which includes mangosteen and lime. Finally, they plant the low- lying layer of coffee, cacao and ginger family plants. </p><p> Mr Chua says that when they mimic the agro-ecological conditions of nature, trees are able to act as a community, building collective resilience to ward off diseases and insects. </p><p> As we meander through the lush greenery, we witness how the land has slowly come back to life. The soil is dark and moist, packed with mycelium, bacteria and all types of organisms. Now, the forest is home to civet cats, wild boars and the like. We pause by the water body, which plays host to a resident eagle and heron. </p><p> Along the way, we chance upon other delightful sights, including a field of tall Mexican sunflowers surrounded by butterflies, red dragon fruit perched on thorny leaves, sweet papayas and flowering coffee trees in abundance. </p><p> The output is modest as the agroforest system is young and the soil is still healing, but the farmers are grateful for its output. The farm has produced pineapples, papayas, 15 types of bananas and rollinia (similar to custard apples), along with a scattering of passion fruit, dragon fruit and breadfruit. </p><p> The farm sends around 120kg of produce to Singapore each week, including to customers who order fruits delivered to their doorstep and to restaurants, such as farm-to-table joint Air CCCC in Dempsey. </p><p> Lessons from the landPart history lesson, part activism and part philosophy lecture, sprinkled with spiritual teachings, the tour takes us on a surprisingly emotional journey.</p><p> We learn that each plant and tree plays its own unique roles to help one another blossom.</p><p> Take, for instance, the sun-loving papaya, which needs fairly good soil over a period of three to five years. To help it thrive, the ALW team plants a tall acacia tree to supply it with nitrogen and a companion ciku plant so that the papaya grows vigorously to take care of it. </p><p> More than process, agroforestry carries a philosophy.</p><p> Near a shady plot of banana plants, Mr Chua poses a question to the group: What does the banana do to help the land become a forest'</p><p> Because of its large size, each banana produces a lot of biomass and oxygen. It is also an ideal home for hundreds of earthworms, whose nutrient-rich excrement replaces fertiliser. </p><p> Mr Chua dramatically slices through the banana stalk, revealing a cross-section of glistening water that can feed nearby plants and trees for a week. He describes the plant as a giver, where 60 per cent of its energy is used to grow itself, while the remainder goes back to the soil and other trees.</p><p> \"A banana plant is so wonderful that, sometimes, it even gives us bananas,\" he says happily.</p><p> As the group moves on, I spy a trio of friends who grab fallen banana leaves to form makeshift umbrellas under the hot sun. </p><p> At another plot, Mr Chua offers a lesson in gratitude.</p><p> Just as people's grandparents and parents created good lives for them, the pioneering early-stage trees and shrubs -- such as acacia, cassava and Mexican sunflower -- paved the way for the next generation of plants to thrive. Now, the land has become lush, flowering and beautiful, like the jackfruit, orchid and cacao plants we see today, he says.</p><p> Stewards of the landGiven the urgency of the climate crisis, the ALW team is on a mission to share its journey with more people.</p><p> Besides open farm days and private tours, the farm welcomes volunteers, who can stay for a minimum of two weeks, to help meet its goal of planting another 40ha of agroforest and re-wilding more areas in the coming years.</p><p> From May, it also plans to roll out weekend syntropic agroforestry basic workshops, as well as agroforestry and mindfulness retreats. </p><p> Already, the tour has seeded new ideas among my fellow participants, some of whom comprise former and current staff at social enterprise Green Nudge in Singapore.</p><p> \"Farmer Will's thoughtful inclusion of the farm's philosophy enriched our understanding of the importance of connecting with our food sources,\" says Singaporean Charmayne Lee, 24, Green Nudge's marketing and communications associate.</p><p> It is nearly noon by the time we return from the tour, hot and sweaty. </p><p> In a warung made of re-engineered wood waste designed by a Kuala Lumpur architect, volunteers have laid out a spread of the forest's gifts: cold cuts of rollinia fruit and papaya topped with passion fruit seeds, jackfruit murukku and steamed cassava served with hot sauce and various dips prepared by Folo Farm. </p><p> We snack on chips made from bananas, yam and cassava by Orang Asli -- indigenous communities in Pahang who attended ALW's workshops. This is done in partnership with international non-profit organisation Global Peace Foundation, which works with Orang Asli in Pahang to teach them how to farm. </p><p> There is also an enzyme bar, where we are served gut-friendly fermented fruit drinks by a long-term farm apprentice who had spent some time in a New York sake brewery. </p><p> As I munch and mingle with the participants on the tour -- a mix of Singaporeans, Malaysians and overseas guests -- we share a newfound sense of gratitude for the food nourishing our bodies. </p><p> I think about how more city folks like myself feel an increased yearning to connect with the earth again. We need to start questioning the systems we have in place and carve out alternative models of land stewardship. Drawing on shared strength in the community, we can chart a new way forward. </p><p> 1.

Lasers being developed for fusion power could also have applications in quantum technology.\"All these technologies will be relevant, not just to the nuclear fusion space, but to a lot of other industries.

The task force comprises 40 senior executives from global corporates, including Singapore Exchange (SGX) head of sustainability and sustainable finance Herry Cho.The final framework comes after a public consultation process that began in March. With the feedback, TNFD added three additional disclosure requirements: On governance, a description of the organisation's human rights policies, engagement activities and oversight with respect to indigenous and local stakeholders; On strategy, a list of priority locations of assets and activities in the organisation's direct - and where available, indirect - operations; and On risk and impact management, a description of processes for identifying, assessing and prioritising nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities throughout the organisation's value chain. The changes mean that companies must assess and prioritise nature-related matters, instead of merely identifying them. </p><p>Corporates must also go beyond discussing nature-based indicators purely in the context of business, strategy and financial planning, to also consider impact on transition plans.TNFD executive director Tony Goldner told reporters that an important aspect of the framework is that it includes disclosures about positive impact.\"If we want to shift the flow of capital to potentially positive outcomes, we have to help businesses and investors see the positive impacts that's possible... Having less-negative impacts needs to be identified separately from positive impacts. We think this is really important from a transparency reporting perspective,\" he said.The inclusion of positive impact traits, in turn, \"lights up\" some of the transformation business models that people are getting excited about, such as the circular economy and regenerative agriculture, he added.Addressing concerns about greenwashing, Goldner said the task force had sought an approach that is \"robust in drawing on the best available science\" and \"practical to use\".Speaking to The Business Times (BT) ahead of the framework's release, Joe Phelan, executive director for Asia-Pacific at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, said the food and agriculture, built environment, and energy sectors will be most impacted by the framework.Pointing out that the systems supporting these industries account for 90 per cent of the pressure on biodiversity and nature globally, he said: \"If you're in those sectors, this is probably already a priority. And if it isn't, then the scrutiny and accountability is going to increase.\"In the built environment sector, for instance, Phelan said nature-related disclosures could push developers to pursue more reuse and refurbishment projects, rather than new builds, as well as redevelop land that was already converted or cleared.

His organisation leads a consultation group tasked with gathering South-east Asian perspectives on TNFD's beta framework.As for the speed of adoption, Phelan said companies can expect the framework to make its way into compliance quicker than climate-related disclosures did, since jurisdictions and regulators are already familiar with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)TNFD's work builds on that of TCFD, which forms the backbone of companies' climate reporting.

TNFD also said the recommendations are consistent with the global sustainability standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board and the impact materiality approach used by the Global Reporting Initiative. They have also been incorporated into the new European Sustainability Reporting Standards.Following TCFD's example, TNFD will also track voluntary market adoption on an annual basis through an annual status update report beginning in 2024, it said.Companies that have announced their intentions to adopt the recommendations include British multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company GSK.

Therefore, the 3 per cent that is remaining is mostly locked in ice caps and glaciers. So humanity is really surviving on one per cent of the water on Earth - quite a sobering thought. A World Resource Institute report tells us that 51 of the 164 countries are expected to suffer from high water stress by 2050, and that's about 31 per cent of the world population. Agriculture today accounts for 72 per cent of the global freshwater withdrawals. In India and Ethiopia, that's 90 per cent. It's fair to say that water efficiency in the agriculture sector across the world is very poor. Industrialisation is also putting water under stress. Half of the 60 largest economies in the world are at risk of water shortages unless climate crisis is averted. So therefore, the picture is really quite grim. Are you hopeful that we're able to save humanity from a water Armageddon?</p><p>President: Well, I treat that as a rhetorical question. There are reasons for deep concern. But the same reasons, I think, offer grounds for optimism.</p><p>First - I hate to say this - but the problems have to be apparent enough, deep enough, and felt enough for people to realise that we have to act on them. It is tragic that we've got longer droughts, more intense floods and a whole set of problems around the world, one region after another, one country after the next. But that's also why minds are being focussed. And that's also why it's harder to be a climate denialist today than it was, say, five years ago, because the problems are obvious, and they're not only in a distant part of the world. They are very close to where you are.</p><p>I think there are grounds for optimism, partly because there's that growing realisation on the part of ordinary people, and the growing difficulty to be a denialist. But I'm also optimistic because when you think about water, first and foremost, the source of the problem isn't natural. It is human made. The source of the problem is mismanagement - gross mismanagement for decades, both of the sources of supply of water, as well as the way we use water, the demand for water. And if that is the case, if we are mismanaging water so badly, it also means we can manage it better. If the problem was human-made, it can also be human-solved, and we can come to that later.</p><p>It requires first, some basic reorientations in the way we understand the problem and the way we understand that we are all in this. It affects all of us. It's not just about another country that's having a very severe drought or severe flood, or that's finding its cities subsiding, which is happening all over the world. It's actually a global problem. And understanding the science and presenting the science in ways that people can understand is, I think, a very important priority. Democratising the science.</p><p>The two key shifts or reorientations in thinking that we need - and in fact, the Global Commission (on the Economics of Water) that I am privileged to co-chair would be advocating this - is first, we have got to understand that we are interdependent in many more ways than we think. We used to think about water interdependence in terms of the rivers that happen to cross boundaries, sometimes a lake, and for some countries, even a pipeline through which we import water from a neighbouring country. That's one form of interdependence.But there's a much larger form of interdependence that science now tells us about, and that is the interdependence that comes from the atmospheric rivers, the atmospheric flows of moisture that connect countries and regions, and in fact connect large parts of the world with each other.</p><p>It's not something that's as visible as a river or even groundwater, but it accounts for more than half of the rainfall we get. More than half of the rainfall we get actually comes from plant life, from what's called green water - the water that's in the surface of the soil, in the plants, and eventually through transpiration, ends up in the atmosphere and comes back through precipitation. More than half of the rainfall that we depend on comes from green water, not the water that we see, which you might call blue water - the rivers, the lakes, and the groundwater.</p><p>So we are greatly interdependent with each other. It's not just the Amazon and the regions around the Amazon where you get a large flow of moisture in the atmosphere. If you take this part of the world, Southeast Asia imports atmospheric moisture from Australia and New Zealand. And that Eastern stretch of the Asia Pacific and Southeast Asia in turn exports moisture to China and Northeast Asia. It's a very significant flow of moisture that makes us interdependent.</p><p>There's another reason why we are interdependent, and that is that the water cycle is inextricably linked with the climate challenge we face.</p><p>Water is not just a casualty of the climate challenge in ways that everyone understands - the droughts, the heatwaves, wildfires and so on. Water is also a cause or a driver of the climate challenge, because the carbon stores in the wetlands, the soil and in the forests are being diminished because of our mismanagement of water.</p><p>Our degradation of the wetlands, our overextraction of groundwater, our mismanagement of water is itself a driver of climate change. We are losing the stores of carbon and increasingly, the natural ecosystems that used to be able to sequester carbon are becoming net emitters of carbon.</p><p>So we're really in a vicious cycle. And that's another reason why we must understand the interdependence. It's not just about the rivers and the lakes. It's really about that link between the water cycle and the climate cycle.</p><p>But I'm optimistic because water is solvable. We can solve the water crisis. We can coordinate internationally, we can take actions in our national interests that can solve this crisis. We have the technologies, we can mobilise the finance, we have got to have the willingness to coordinate and collaborate with each other. But we can solve this crisis. If you like, water is the low-hanging fruit in addressing the much broader challenge of climate and biodiversity.</p><p>Robin Hu: You mentioned that the problems and the crisis of water are caused by man, and perhaps a solution will also lie in the heads of man as well. And this is probably a good time for us to talk a little bit about the possibility of the importance of water innovation and water adaptation.</p><p>As we know, changes to the global hydrological cycle have led to unprecedented floods, storms, drought, heatwaves - here today and there tomorrow. So today, one child under the age of five dies every 80 seconds from diseases caused by water pollution. 2 billion people are yet to have access to safe water. The Global Commission for the Economics of Water, which you mentioned that you have the privilege to co-chair, published a report last year. In it, it states that we must drive down the cost of technologies by adopting them at scale. So the solutions seem to lie in innovation and adaptation. The question is, how can we move from the path of mutually assured destruction to mutually assured prosperity across all fronts, including policy, science, innovation, adaptation - and you mentioned earlier - investment?</p><p>President: The reason why I said water is the low-hanging fruit in the broader climate and biodiversity challenge, is because I think we've reached a turning point where the innovations required to solve the water crisis are now within our reach. A fair number are within our reach within this decade, and most of them are within our reach in the next three decades.</p><p>If you compare it to the climate challenge, it's broadly assessed that about 50 per cent of the technologies required for us to reach net zero are already available. They already mature, they need to be scaled up, and the cost needs to be driven down. About 50 per cent of the technologies are available, and the other 50 per cent are still at an experimental stage - green hydrogen, direct capture from the air, and so on.</p><p>When it comes to water, I would say at least 75 per cent of the technologies required for us to solve this crisis to stabilise the global water cycle are available. They are mature and they too need to be scaled up. We need to drive them down the cost curve so that they can be scaled up all around the world, including in the developing world. And that's a great source for optimism. We have to organise it, we have to finance it, and we've got to create demand for these water technologies, from the smallholder farmer to the industry that uses a lot of water. We've got to create that demand.</p><p>That's why it requires not just private markets, which are critical, but we will take a long time to solve this. You need public policy that incentivises demand and incentivises change on the part of those who are using water in agriculture, in industry, even in domestic use in households. And it can be done because we have lots of case studies around the world, in cities as well as in rural areas, that actually show how you can conserve water, you can improve yields in farms, you can improve farmers' incomes, and you can have sustainable agriculture and sustainable industry.</p><p>So the best practices that we see in cities, towns and rural areas around the world need to be scaled up. I'm optimistic. Set ourselves challenges and work together to meet it- the public and private sector within countries. Find ways in which you get international support, particularly for the developing world, so they can scale up these solutions.</p><p>Robin Hu: So we need to drive across policy, science, R&amp;D, technology development, investing and deployment of capital to be able to solve all the problems by putting all these things together.</p><p>President: And most importantly, I would say, start valuing water seriously. Start pricing water seriously. Subsidise the poor so they have access to clean water. But if we don't price water, we are going to discourage innovation, we are going to discourage water conservation, and it's going to be terrible for the poor. If you don't price water, it's terrible for the poor because water will be used excessively in industry and by the largest farmers, by the largest users, and we won't have enough for the poor.</p><p>So we've got to move away from the mindset, which still exists in a lot of international discussion, that thinks of water pricing as something that's inequitable. It's exactly the opposite way around. Water pricing is necessary for us to conserve water and to use it more efficiently, to have more water available for those who are underserved today.</p><p>And then we've got to accompany water pricing with appropriate subsidies. Subsidies for the poor, subsidies for the small farmer, and very importantly, get rid of the bad subsidies, because we've got about $700 billion of subsidies each year spent on encouraging people to use water or energy excessively, including fossil fuels.</p><p>So we've got to redirect those subsidies to good use, so that we encourage sustainable practices and we support the poor.</p><p>Mr Robin Hu: On the note of pricing water right and correctly, it is important to understand that we have to price natural capital correctly as well. And I think we all understand financial capital, we know social capital, we know human capital, but very little is understood or talked about in terms of natural capital. So, if I can bring us back to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992, that Summit had some very significant deliverables among them - the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and of course the Convention on Biological Diversity. So, in a way, climate change and biodiversity loss were identified as nature's existential threats at around the same time, 32 years ago.</p><p>Since then, of course, overwhelming science and evidence has turned climate from crisis into accounting. And accounting then translated into policy making, corporate responsibility, consumer behaviour, all of which are very good.</p><p>But as we know, we are all loathe to subject our children to financial debt.And I think we now loathe to subject our children into climate debt, but we are quite nonchalant about subjecting our children and future generations into nature debt. Why is that? And the notion of natural capital remains a very fuzzy concept to even the most informed segment of our community. What can we do to correct this?</p><p>President: We have got to make it less fuzzy, the whole concept of natural capital.</p><p>First, we are addressing a reality. If you take water for example, water doesn't come from the tap. It comes from natural ecosystems that evaporate and transpire water, and the precipitation. That's the global water cycle. It means we've got to preserve the natural ecosystems, be they forests or wetlands, or ensuring we are not over-extracting from rivers or over-extracting from groundwater.</p><p>In order for us to preserve that instinct of conserving water and the ecosystem that produces water, and all the benefits we get from water, we have got to first account for it. We've got to know where it is, we've got to know every resource that leads to this supply for water, and we've got to value it. If we don't value it, there's no incentive to preserve it. And this is, I think, now catching on. In fact, at the COP last year (which saw the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework), there was a major move forward, an agreement, to start accounting for natural capital.</p><p>I think we are at very early stages of this process, and there is a lot of work ahead. First, in just getting the data together, having a systematic way of mapping natural resources, including water resources, and then having to value the benefits we get. I think we have to approach this both top down, through international agreements and the coordination required, through scientific work; as well as bottom up.</p><p>In bottom up, there's already movement. Countries are now taking very seriously the mapping of their natural resources, their natural capital. The Philippines is a very good example. It started last year on a systematic approach to geospatial mapping of all its natural resources, with water in mind as well, so that it knows exactly where its resources are and what needs to be preserved.</p><p>Companies are moving. Some companies are heavy users of water; we were all enjoying the beer that was given to us. All the drinks manufacturers use a lot of water, naturally. Coca Cola, Pepsi, Heineken, and so on. But these companies now realise, especially the leaders in the field, that it is an unsustainable business unless they invest upstream in the natural catchments, help farmers to use water more efficiently and treat that as part of their business model. Help conserve natural catchments.</p><p>They all realise that it's now unsustainable, and they are adopting various forms of natural capital accounting, in its primitive form at the very least, because they know it is in their own interest. They might not be mandated to do it now, but they know 10 years, 15 years from now, it's going to be necessary, so they might as well take the lead.</p><p>And I'm quite impressed by what some of them are doing. Danone is another example. Olam happens to be Singapore-based - another very good example that has natural capital accounting, systematically, in its business, and it knows that it has to preserve sustainability upstream, not just in the plant where it's doing the manufacturing or the processing.</p><p>So, I think we need both, a top-down approach which eventually has to translate into regulatory practices and disclosure practices. Just like we've achieved for carbon, we have to move on to biodiversity and water. And I would say water, even there, is the low-hanging fruit because it's much more specifically defined compared to the biodiversity.</p><p>But we also need to get a lot more voluntary action on the part of corporates, with the largest corporates being able to take the lead, because they know that 10 years from now, this is unsustainable. They've got to have a way of valuing and preserving the natural ecosystems on which their business depends.</p><p>Robin Hu: On a regulatory note, I recall some years back there was no requirement for us to disclose anything on sustainability and climate. Now we do. Do you see the day that will come, and perhaps soon, that we will have to disclose on nature?</p><p>President: I think it is inevitable, and like I said, the COP in Kunming last year was a major step forward. But it's a lot of hard work. We are still at a very early stage of that process.</p><p>Robin Hu: As in all things, it helps to have money. And to solve the problem of climate of biodiversity and water crisis, we need some money. Money, as we know, gravitates towards where the risk-return reward is the best, and advancing nature, unfortunately, doesn't appear to be that, at least not now. So how can capital owners, investors, companies, NGOs, governments, all get together to deploy capital to preserve biodiversity, and invigorate nature's ecosystem by adding moisture to the life cycle?</p><p>President: When I mentioned that water innovation is at a turning point, it is at a turning point not only because the technologies are now mature and available, but because it's an investable opportunity - you can earn a decent return from water innovation, in every sector.</p><p>If you take agriculture, the techniques of micro-irrigation, the techniques of regenerative agriculture that improves soil health, pay back the investor, be it a farmer or an external investor relatively quickly, because this is a mature technology. Within six months to one and a half years, you get a payback on your investment.</p><p>If you take the circular water economy, recycling of water, generating value even out of wastewater, it's an investable opportunity. If you take the most basic humanitarian objective, which is making sure that no child need die from lack of access to clean water, there is so much to be done by way of investment in decentralised wastewater treatment.</p><p>In fact, there are several companies in Singapore that are doing that. There's a very interesting project based in Nanyang Technological University that's doing it in Myanmar. There's a company called Atera that is doing it in Vietnam. Low cost, affordable, small scale water treatment using reverse membrane technologies, using membranes with special carbon particles. All these need to be scaled up. They're affordable, they earn a decent return, and they're good for the communities that we're engaging in.</p><p>So we have got to avoid looking at the world as having a set of problems that are of a humanitarian nature and require only public capital; and another half of the world is being investment capital driven by the private sector. They're actually the same world. You've got to look for investable opportunities everywhere, enable communities to benefit from investment, and ensure that capital can be recycled because it earns a return.</p><p>That's the only realistic strategy, because the public sector globally does not have infinite resources. In fact it's running out of resources. And the task of public policy, nationally and multilaterally, has to be to mobilise private capital by providing it with some regulatory certainty, sometimes providing it with an incentive as well, or some sharing of risk, because there is opportunity for investment in solving these large problems of the commons.</p><p>Participant: Singapore has accomplished so much; it is like the Silicon Valley of technology. But where do you think Singapore can play the next role? It's already been an example about the four national taps, the water. You have a vision, but how does Singapore take what you have articulated and spread that over the world?</p><p>Participant 2: Christopher Gasson from Global Water Intelligence. What proportion of Temasek's portfolio do you think should be held in water related assets? What proportion is it now and what should it be in future?</p><p>President: On the first, I think Singapore's realisation from its very outset, and Mr Lee Kuan Yew's leadership insistence, was on water being existential for our country. The good news is that water is now becoming existential for every country. So, Singapore had no choice but to innovate, to take it very seriously. It wasn't just the responsibility of one minister or one agency, it became a Cabinet responsibility, a whole-of-government responsibility, and in fact a whole- of-society responsibility, as it is in the Netherlands and some other countries. We now need that same cast of minds everywhere. Water is becoming existential.</p><p>Our role is modest because we are a small country, but we can be a testbed for experimentation. Not just experimentation in the lab, but in the field. And I'm quite encouraged by the fact that there's a whole set of companies that are coming up. Some are Singaporean or Singapore-based, some are foreign companies that are coming to Singapore to collaborate with our universities or with other companies here. There are spawning experiments everywhere in Asia, from agriculture to industrial wastewater recycling.</p><p>I think the other role we can play, besides scaling up innovation, is in blended finance, which we take very seriously in Singapore, because that has to be the investment finance solution.</p><p>It's not going to be the public sector by itself, and the private sector on its own will not move fast enough. We need blended finance to spur the process, to front-load the innovations, and we think it can be done. And we want Asia to be not a laggard, but a leader in this area.</p><p>On Christopher Gasson's question, first of all, I can't answer on the behalf of Temasek. Even if I was still part of the government, the government doesn't answer on behalf of Temasek. But I must say I'm impressed by Temasek's commitment to climate, water, and biodiversity. It sees it as an investment and part of the investment universe, and it sees that intersection between decent investment returns and doing good for the planet.</p><p>That, I think, is a huge opportunity. Climate, water and biodiversity are the largest investment opportunities we've seen in 50 years. Investments in innovations that are mature and can be scaled up. Investments of a higher risk in the more experimental technologies that are not yet mature, but out of which will come successful technologies with very high returns.</p><p>You got to think of it globally, because the largest opportunities are actually in the developing world, but there is appetite for it now amongst leading players in the investment world.</p><p>Robin Hu: We've ended right on time and thank you for the questions.

Corporates must also go beyond discussing nature-based indicators purely in the context of business, strategy and financial planning, to also consider impact on transition plans.</p><p> TNFD on Tuesday also issued guidance for financial institutions, which stated that they should describe standards and policies covering forestry, fisheries, palm oil or mining, if they impose limits or other due diligence standards on investment, lending or insurance activities around these.</p><p> The task force further proposed two core sector disclosure metrics to support the disclosure of their exposure to sectors with material nature-related dependencies and impacts, and exposure to sensitive locations. More specifically, banks should release their absolute amount or percentage of lending volume related to these exposures.</p><p> The guidance provided a list of priority sectors to consider. They include oil, gas and consumable fuels, construction materials, containers and packaging, metals and mining, paper and forest products, automobiles, food and beverage products, semiconductors and utilities.</p><p> Sensitive locations, it noted, are those where the assets and activities in an organisation's operations interface with nature in areas important for biodiversity, and areas of high ecosystem integrity, rapid decline in ecosystem integrity, and high physical water risks.

All are reared on pasture with plenty of space to roam and rotationally grazed so the soil can recover.</p><p> They are then butchered in slaughterhouses designed by celebrated animal-welfare expert Temple Grandin.</p><p> The farm has also been in the news for improving the health of its soil and the fact that its cows sequester more carbon than they produce.</p><p> Bluffton - a hamlet of fewer than 100 people - is a two-hour drive from Atlanta, and the first thing you notice when stumbling out of the car is the air: crisp, salty-sweet and occasionally wreathed in fog.</p><p> Cell phone reception is spotty on the farm, but if you start to panic, the sight of happy-looking animals and iridescent swathes of grass calms you down - and this curious therapeutic effect is extended if you spend the night in one of the visitor cabins.</p><p> If you are pressed for time, however, the farm's general store and restaurant are the perfect introduction to what makes it special.</p><p> There are the flashier cuts of meat - a 32oz (900g) tomahawk steak, for instance, or cured Iberico pork from a prized Spanish breed that White Oak Pastures was the first to import to America.</p><p> But, unusually for the US, the rest of the animal is not wasted. So you find things such as beef tendons, chicken feet and marrow bones - goodies that Singaporeans who grew up eating nose-to-tail Asian dishes would appreciate.</p><p>With better farming practices, we can raise plants and animals in a way that benefits soil health and the ecosystem at large.</p><p> MR EDLIN CHOI, a New York City native who left his job to join White Oak Pastures' internship programme internship programme</p><p>  The beef, duck and turkey jerkies - seasoned with soya sauce and brown sugar - are another unexpected reminder of home.</p><p> Sinking my teeth into a glistening strip of beef, it tasted exactly like premium bak kwa, the Chinese dried-meat snack.</p><p>     Return airfare in April on Lufthansa (lufthansa.com/sg) from Singapore to Atlanta via Frankfurt goes for around $1,500.</p><p> Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is the busiest passenger airport in the world, so there is no shortage of ways to get to White Oak Pastures in Bluffton.</p><p> Hiring a vehicle from the airport's rental-car hub is a breeze. From there, it is a 21/2-hour drive to the farm.</p><p>WHERE TO STAY</p><p> Book one of the delightful cabins at White Oak Pastures. Four one-bedroom cabins are tucked away in a longleaf pine forest, where cattle, hogs or chickens may wander past your door.</p><p> A fifth, with two bedrooms, overlooks a pond. This is the only one with a television and none of the cabins has Wi-Fi, so this is a precious chance to disconnect and explore the farm, which visitors are encouraged to do.</p><p> Rates range from US$99 (S$138) to US$259 a night. Each cabin has a kitchen, so you can cook up the farm's delicious offerings.</p><p> For more information, go to whiteoakpastures.com</p><p>WHAT ELSE TO DO</p><p> Explore the capital of Georgia. Atlanta is crammed with well-known attractions, from the moving Martin Luther King, Jr National Historic Site - birthplace of the civil rights pioneer - to the uber-Instagrammable World of Coca-Cola Museum.</p><p> The city also has a vibrant dining scene where you can get a taste of the South.</p><p>  The farm sells eggs and organic vegetables as well, and its zero-waste policy means it also produces leather goods, soaps made from tallow or beef fat and pet chews fashioned from animal parts such as tracheas, typically discarded.</p><p> Much of it is pricier than what can be found in most supermarkets. But advocates of food produced this way believe it is more nutritious, has fewer toxins and is better for the planet.</p><p> The man behind it all is owner Will Harris, who is something of a legend in farming circles.</p><p> In the mid-1990s, he began questioning the practices that give animal agriculture a bad rap - the concentrated animal feeding operations decried as inhumane, and the use of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and antibiotics.</p><p> If you run into the charismatic 65-year-old, he might share some of his pithy insights on the failures of the modern food system.</p><p> By centralising and industrialising food production, the US has made food \"obscenely cheap, wastefully abundant and boringly consistent\", he observes in his soothing Southern drawl.</p><p> \"But it had unintended consequences that fell on the back of animal welfare, rural America and the degradation of the land, water and air.\"</p><p> But how do you convince people to pay more for regeneratively farmed food'</p><p> \"We have found a customer base that supports us,\" he says. \"They think it's better for them, tastes better and is better for the animals and environment.\"</p><p> White Oak Pastures is savvy about cultivating that base.

Roughly US$44 trillion (S$62 trillion) of economic output - more than half of global annual GDP - is moderately or highly reliant on nature, a landmark report by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) said recently. Yet it found that intensive agriculture, deforestation, mining and pollution have degraded up to 40 per cent of the planet's land surface, throwing into question how humanity will grow enough food in the future, especially when faced with the worsening, and related, crises of climate change and loss of biodiversity.</p><p> The UNCCD report is a timely reminder that the Earth has finite resources and that mankind is taking those resources faster than nature can replace them.

The land also helps regulate the water cycle that feeds rivers and provides moisture to clouds and hence rainfall.</p><p> Severe soil erosion from deforestation and intensive agriculture has curbed crop yields, reduced water retention and cut the amount of carbon soils can store. Damage to the land also exacerbates droughts, which are already on the increase because of rising global temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns. The UNCCD says the number and duration of droughts globally has risen 29 per cent since 2000. And unless action is taken, an estimated 700 million people will be at risk of being displaced by drought by 2030.</p><p> These stark findings are a call to action for nations to invest in land restoration.

That is gradually changing, however, as consumers are becoming more conscious of what they eat and where their food is sourced. The common trend these days is a shift towards healthier food choices - even better if it is sustainable and transparently sourced. The latest data from a survey by online market research firm YouGov revealed that as of January this year, more than a third (34 per cent) of Singapore consumers said that they are actively trying to cut down on their meat intake. Over a third are undecided about changing their level of meat consumption (36 per cent), which indicates that they may be at least considering it. </p><p>Separately, the global Innova Consumer Survey 2020 found that the top reasons for considering plant-based alternatives were health, diet variety, sustainability and taste. It found that six in 10 global consumers are interested in learning more about where their food come from and how it is made, while three in four consumers expect companies to invest in sustainability. These trends has had a tangible impact on the food scene here as well.

Now in my late 30s, I see that people are going back to the idea of, 'Let's think about it, when and why are we eating it, and where does it come from?' \"We're really fortunate to finally ask these questions - and it's important to ask them.\" Ms Yadav, who is married to a Sri Lankan, recently left her previous startup, a communications agency, to focus on her passion in sharing good food and contributing towards a more sustainable food supply system. She is not a vegan, but said that she is looking to reduce her meat intake due to ethical reasons. For instance, there is greater awareness on the way animals are reared and killed for food, and its large-scale impact on the environment. A major new study published in 2021 in Nature Food, an online research journal, has found that global production of meat causes twice the pollution of production of plant-based foods, for example. In her past attempts to eat less meat, Ms Yadav found it tough to find healthy plant-based alternatives. Out of convenience, she turned to unhealthy high-carbohydrate food such as cake. Ms Yadav said that Jungle Kitchen is not a brand targeted at vegans, but rather, she hopes to empower people to weave in more plant-based options into their diet. She has also observed a growing appreciation for return-to-roots fare that involves the use of indigenous ingredients and local flavours. This is why familiar tropical fruits such as jackfruit are among the key ingredients featured in Jungle Kitchen's debut range. One of its signature products is a ready-to-cook plant-based mince called Jungle Jack, made with jackfruit, beetroot, moringa, kohila and other flavourful herbs and spices. Both moringa and kohila are plants commonly found in tropical Asia, and are good sources of vitamins, minerals and nutrients. The plant-based mince can be shaped into a burger patty or meatball. The brand also has ready-to-eat products including a hot sauce, young jackfruit curry and coconut sambol (a staple of every meal in Sri Lanka made with lime, chilli and coconut). The ready-to-cook products are meant to be versatile and can be easily used when cooking meals at home. For example, the Jungle Jack plant-based mince can be used as a minced meat substitute. It can be shaped into patties to make burgers or cooked in soups, stews or sauces - much like how one would cook bolognese sauce for pasta. The readily available but often overlooked tropical fruit has a naturally meaty mouthful that works well as a meat alternative, Ms Yadav said. Other ingredients used are coconut, chilli, banana blossom. Ms Yadav said that she and co-founder Mukeeta Manukulasuriya are also passionate about doing their part to build a more sustainable and equitable food system. Ms Manukulasuriya, 26, a Sri Lankan, is a third-generation owner of a food production factory in Sri Lanka that is founded and run by females. The startup works with and support smaller farm holders with transparent and sustainable farming processes. \"We're now sourcing from regenerative farms where there's visibility in terms of farming practices, how they treat their workers, etc,\" Ms Yadav said. \"We also work with smaller farms so there're fewer middlemen taking a cut and more income goes directly to the farmer.\" Regenerative agriculture is a conservation and rehabilitation approach to farming. It focuses on improving the health of soil to restore agricultural land that has been degraded by the use of heavy machinery, fertilisers and pesticides. Being so selective with who they work with has its challenges. \"It's tough keeping up with the big boys in the industry with their deep pockets,\" Ms Yadav said. Working with small farms means that output will never be as large as companies that work with industrial-sized farms, she added. It would also affect how they price their products. However, Ms Yadav said that there is a big difference between what is competitively price and fairly priced. \"Pricing a product competitively can be quite dangerous because it becomes a race to the bottom at the expense of the workers or producers. \"Just look at tea - tea pluckers are paid lesser increasingly because companies are trying to drive costs down to price competitively,\" she added. \"We are going to price our products fairly. We won't be the cheapest around, but we believe that what we are doing offers value.\" Another unique feature of Jungle Kitchen is that it is owned and run by an all-female team - and that is no coincidence. For the co-founders, it is their way of paying homage to the women who have raised them and a bid to improve gender equity in the food industry. \"When you look at the economics of the food-and-beverage (F and B) industry, it's primarily male-dominated - not just chefs but the big F and B businesses are also male-owned,\" Ms Yadav said. \"Most of us know that our mothers and grandmothers are the cooks at home, but there is a mismatch of who does the work and who gets the rewards. We are hoping that wherever possible, we try to hire and empower females.\" At home, Ms Yadav said that she uses her own company's products. \"We use them a lot at home. That said, we probably shouldn't keep eating our own supply,\" she said with a laugh. \"Besides our own products, we are also eating different things because we want to experiment on what we can come up with next.\" Jungle Kitchen's products are available on its webstore and will soon be available in supermarkets and speciality grocery stores.</p>", "publisher": "Today (Singapore) - Online", "instances": ["\"We're now sourcing from regenerative farms where there's visibility in terms of farming practices, how they treat their workers, etc,\" Ms Yadav said. \"We also work with smaller farms so there're fewer middlemen taking a cut and more income goes directly to the farmer.

For more than a decade I've been offering selections of 20 bottles under US$20. Some people have suggested that I raise the price cap to reflect the effect of inflation. But I resist that because plenty of less-familiar values are still in a US$15 to US$20 sweet spot. Here are the 20 bottles, beginning with the least expensive and rising up to US$20.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Maris, Pays d'Oc Rouge IGP 2020, US$14.99Pays d'Oc is a large region in southern France for wines that don't conform to the stricter rules of the Languedoc or Roussillon appellations, which makes sense for Maris, something of a maverick producer that farms organically with attention to biodiversity and the environment. This bottle is juicy, focused, refreshing and an excellent value.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Bertha, Cava Brut Nature Reserva 2020, US$15.99Good cava is one of the best values you can find in sparkling wine. All cava must be made the same way as Champagne, with a second, bubbles-inducing fermentation in the bottle. Bertha is made from the trio of classic Catalonian cava grapes -- and it's bone dry, a little bit creamy, with attractive herbal and citrus flavours. </p><p> Domaine Faillenc Sainte Marie, Corbieres 2020, US$15.99I'm drawn to Faillenc Sainte Marie because, in a world of overly polished wines, this is an old school, rough and rustic red of the sort of bottles I used to find from the south of France when I was learning about wine in the 1980s. This bottle, an equal blend of syrah, grenache and cinsault fermented together, is herbal, fruity and tannic, a wine without makeup or artifice. </p><p> Pedro Parra y Familia, Itata Vinista Pais 2020, US$15.99Pedro Parra of Chile, a terroir and geological consultant for an all-star roster of winemakers, is also an excellent producer in his own right, specialising in making wines from old vineyards in the Itata region. This one is from 100-year-old vines of pais, a grape brought to the New World by the Spanish. It's herbal and refreshing with just the slightest sandpapery rasp to the texture. </p><p> Brigaldara, Valpolicella 2021, US$15.99Classic Valpolicella is a straightforward style, made without the added power and richness that comes with the increasingly popular ripasso method. Good classic examples, like this bottle from Brigaldara, are pure and easy, with floral aromas and flavours of sweet cherry that resolve with a refreshing bitterness. </p><p> Luis, Pato Portugal Baga Espumante Bruto Rosado NV, US$15.99Luis Pato is one of the pillars of the modern wine industry in the Bairrada region of Portugal. This rose sparkling wine is made with a second fermentation occurring in the bottle, producing the carbonation. It's made of the region's best red grape, baga, and is fresh and lively, with light fruit and herbal flavours. </p><p> Gaia, Retsina Ritinitis Nobilis NV, US$16.99Retsina is a style in which wine is blended with the resin of the Aleppo pine. Gaia uses mountain-grown roditis grapes and fresh resin to produce this fresh, sharp and savoury wine. Try it with any sort of Greek or Middle Eastern food, or simply experiment. </p><p> Michel Guignier, Beaujolais 2021, US$17.99I especially like the '21 Guignier Beaujolais, which rises above the straightforward Beaujolais appellation, the lowest level of the region's hierarchy of potential. This bottle, made with organically farmed fruit, has beautiful flavours of red fruit underpinned by earthy minerality that gives it unexpected depth. </p><p> Muga, Rioja White 2021, US$18.96This white Rioja from Muga, one of the region's leading estates, is wonderfully appealing. It's made of viura, garnacha blanca and malvasia, a traditional blend, and, though it's aged in oak, it's fresh and lively, with just enough of a rub of tannin to give it a bit of texture. </p><p> Giordano Lombardo, Gavi 2021, US$18.99This energetic white, made with organically grown cortese grapes, has all the liveliness you'd expect in a Gavi, with the added bonus of lemon and mineral flavours and a satisfying weight to the texture, and goes with all manner of seafood. </p><p> Altos Las Hormigas, Uco Valley Terroir Malbec 2019, US$19This is one of the most reliable malbec producers in the Mendoza region of Argentina, with wines that are always balanced and tapered rather than sweetly fruity. This bottle is intense yet fresh, lightly tannic and fruity, just right for burgers or skirt steak. </p><p> Jasci, Trebbiano d'Abruzzo 2021, US$19Jasci is one of a growing number of small producers who have turned Abruzzo into a great source for exciting wines. Its Trebbiano d'Abruzzo is made out of the high-quality trebbiano Abruzzese grape. The grapes are farmed organically and trained on overhead pergolas, a traditional method. The wine is clear, pure, textured and refreshing. </p><p> Chateau Peybonhomme-les-Tours, Blaye Cotes de Bordeaux Le Blanc Bonhomme 2020, US$19.96The wines from Chateau Peybonhomme-les-Tours are always excellent, they are great values and they're made from biodynamically farmed grapes. This terrific white, from the sandy soils of Blaye, is uncommonly rich, deep and textured, yet dry and refreshing. </p><p> Chateau de Chaintres, Saumur Champigny Les Sables 2020, US$19.96This is the first bottle I've had from Chateau de Chaintres, but it will not be the last. The 2020 Les Sables is an excellent Saumur Champigny red, made entirely from biodynamically farmed cabernet franc grapes. It's rich, with earthy flavours of dark fruits and flowers. </p><p> Orto Vins, Montsant Les Argiles d'Orto Vins 2019, US$19.96Montsant is often a great source for value in rich, structured wines from Catalonia in north-eastern Spain, and Orto Vins is one of my favourite Montsant producers. It farms biodynamically, practices regenerative agriculture and makes its wine carefully. Les Argiles is mostly garnacha with about 10 per cent carignan grown on clay soils, which gives the wine volume and power. Nonetheless, it's fresh and tapered, and would go well with roasts and stews.</p><p> Chateau Puech Redon, Vin de France Apparente Rouge 2019, US$19.96Cyril Cuche, the proprietor of Chateau Puech Redon in Languedoc, with the aid of Eric Texier, the excellent Rhone producer, makes this red, mostly cinsault, without any added sulphur dioxide, a stabiliser and antioxidant omitted by only the most militant natural producers. It is delicious, lightly tannic with fresh flavours of red fruits and herbs. </p><p> Nittnaus, Burgenland Anita Red Blend 2018, US$19.96Hans and Anita Nittnaus make beautiful wines in the Burgenland region of eastern Austria, including this juicy, deeply fruity blend, mostly zweigelt with blaufrankisch, St Laurent and merlot. It is thirst-quenching and delicious.</p><p> Meinklang, Burgenland White 2020, US$19.96This striking white, from eastern Austria near the Hungarian border has got personality and character. It's made of 50 per cent gruner veltliner, 40 per cent grasevina and 10 per cent muscat, which may account for its powerfully fruity perfume and cornucopia of flavours. It's pure and alive, typical of Meinklang, a mixed-use farm that grows everything biodynamically. </p><p> Early Mountain Vineyards, Virginia Chambourcin Young Wine 2021, US$19.99I haven't had great luck with wines from Virginia or with chambourcin, a hybrid red grape. But this is an excellent example of both -- it's fresh, fruity and gentle, unimpeded by intrusive winemaking, a refreshing, low-alcohol delight, just right for friends watching a game. </p><p> Domaine Tatsis, Macedonia Xinomavro-Negoska Young Vines 2017, US$19.99The Tatsis brothers, Periklis and Stergios, farm biodynamically in the Macedonia region of northern Greece and make wines with minimal processing. This bottle, made of a blend of xinomavro and negoska, is a lovely introduction. It's fragrant with aromas of menthol and licorice and, though made of young vines, is structured enough for lamb chops or roasted meats.

Mr Baumann noted that the right solutions with science and technology have to be found to solve the problems of society and the planet."]}, {"relevance_score": 52, "title": "No one wants to say, 'Put down that burger', but we really should", "published": "2022-12-17", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earth is in the midst of the worst mass extinction since an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago -- and this time, the asteroid is us. Human beings are displacing the planet's other species at an unprecedented rate, a disaster that the landmark UN Biodiversity Conference known as COP15 is focused on this week in Montreal. We are a unique menace, but we at least have a unique ability to recognise it and do something about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The first step towards recovery, of course, is admitting your problem, and the conference's draft plan warns upfront that a million species will face extinction if we do not clean up our act. But while the delegates in Montreal are pointing fingers at everything from plastics to pesticides to invasive species, biodiversity loss is not that complicated a mystery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The basic problem is that we have converted half of the earth's habitable land into agricultural land. We are destroying and degrading the habitats of other species to grow food for our own.</p><p> This means the fate of the world's bugs, bunnies and other creatures and critters -- and what is left of the forests, wetlands and other habitats they call home -- depends more than anything else on what we put in our mouths and how it gets made. Unfortunately, telling people what to eat and farmers how to farm are politically unpalatable tasks, which helps explain why yakfests like COP15 tend to obscure the problem with word salad.</p><p> Environmentalists hope to leave Montreal with commitments from governments to preserve 30 per cent of the earth by 2030 and to meet 21 other targets. But governments have already failed to achieve less ambitious conservation goals set for 2010 and 2020. There is also buzz around nailing down corporate commitments to greener supply chains, but COP15 is mostly dancing around the crux of the biodiversity crisis.</p><p> The crux is that if current eating and farming trends continue, the world will clear land equal to at least 1 1/4  Indias by 2050. That would be a disaster for the climate and wildlife, dooming carbon-rich and biodiverse ecosystems such as the Amazon and Congo rainforests.</p><p> So those eating and farming trends better not continue. Humanity needs to start shrinking our agricultural footprint and expanding our natural footprint, after thousands of years of doing the reverse.</p><p> This will be an extraordinary challenge, because we will also need to produce more than 7.4 quadrillion additional calories every year to feed our growing population, in an era when climate-fuelled droughts, heatwaves, floods, and blights could make it harder to grow food.</p><p> You can see why word salad can seem more appetising.</p><p> You can also see why promises to conserve land or promote deforestation-free products can ring hollow. Governments can pledge to ban land clearing, but when their people get hungry, land will get cleared. Some companies might sign agreements to avoid soya or beef from newly deforested land, but it would not do much if other companies keep buying soya or beef from newly deforested land.</p><p> If we are serious about cleaning up the mess we are making for less influential species, there are four things individuals as well as nations and corporations can do.</p><p> What we can doThe first is to eat less meat, which would be a lot easier if meat were not so beloved and delicious. Limiting access to cheeseburgers can turn politicians into former politicians, so it is no coincidence that the Montreal draft mentions changing diets only in passing in its 16th target. But the inconvenient truth is that when we eat cows, chickens and other livestock, we might as well be eating macaws, jaguars and other endangered species.</p><p> That is because livestock chew up far more land per calorie than crops. Producing beef is 100 times as land-intensive as cultivating potatoes, and 55 times as land-intensive as peas or nuts. Livestock now use nearly 80 per cent of agricultural land while producing less than 20 per cent of calories. Cattle are the leading driver of deforestation in the Amazon, followed by soya beans, another commodity, which get fed to pigs and chickens.</p><p> Meat consumption is expected to increase dramatically as billions of the global poor escape poverty. If Americans continue to average three burgers a week while the developing world starts to follow our path, it is hard to see how the Amazon survives.</p><p> But it is at least possible that we could shrink agricultural footprint by shifting our diets towards meat made without livestock, like the plant-based substitutes offered by companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat or maybe someday cultured meat grown from animal cells.</p><p> The next thing we need to do is waste less food. About a third of the food grown is lost or tossed before it reaches our mouths, which means a third of the land (as well as the water, fertiliser and other resources) used to grow that food is also wasted. But the Montreal text includes only a single mention of the need to \"halve per capita global food waste\", with no suggestions of what technological, behavioural and policy changes could help to meet such an ambitious goal.</p><p> Every hectare of land matters, because we desperately need to grow more food, provide habitats for more native flora and fauna and store more carbon to limit climate change. And that is why it is particularly crazy to use the earth's limited land to grow fuel. </p><p> The third way to ease the global land squeeze would be to stop using productive farmland for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel -- and to stop burning trees for power -- but the Montreal plan does not even address the topic.</p><p> In fact, there is global momentum to expand bioenergy's dominion over the land. A new paper in the journal Nature estimates that new European Union policies could wipe out half the continent's most biodiverse grasslands and divert a fifth of its cropland to energy crops, which would lead to land clearing overseas to replace the lost food. The EU is also promoting wood-burning power plants, a recipe for massive forest cutting around the world.</p><p> Farm and forest interests have so much political power that government efforts to increase demand for crops and wood are often considered untouchable. But if biodiversity is a real priority, they cannot be.</p><p> Finally, if we are going to shrink our agricultural footprint enough to stop deforestation and hopefully restore some degraded ecosystems, so they can once again serve as wildlife habitats and carbon sinks, farmers will have to supersize their yields enough to make a lot more food with a lot less land. And while the 20th-century's Green Revolution raised yields by using fossil fuel-derived fertilisers, toxic pesticides and other environmentally damaging innovations, the 21st century will require some greener ones that can ramp up productivity without messing up the planet.</p><p> Once again, this does not seem like a priority in Montreal. There has been much more focus on regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and other gentler, lower-yield alternatives to intensive industrial farming that can improve biodiversity on farmland. The problem is that they can require more farmland to produce the same amount of food, accelerating the destruction of the natural lands that provide far more biodiversity than farmland ever can -- and suck far more heat-trapping carbon from our overloaded atmosphere.</p><p> Earth now has more than 5 billion ha of agricultural land, an area twice the size of North America. Adding more is the surest way to wipe out more species -- and maybe, someday, our own.

Biodiversity is a more holistic indicator of well-functioning ecosystems, whereas using carbon as a particular sustainability metric may not reflect nature's inherent and inspiring complexity.' <br/>The Biodiversity Accelerator+[2], launched late last month, is a three-month online programme. It consists of extensive group sessions and discussions with its core coaches, tailored one-on-one coaching, and fireside chats with entrepreneurs and industry experts \u2014 all offered for no fee or equity. <br/>The accelerator aims to support businesses with market-based solutions in conservation and restoration, or what it calls 'biodiversity-positive' companies. <br/>They are: <br/>Regenerative agriculture/aquaculture opportunities across the value chain: Examples include companies selling sustainable agri-inputs (biodiverse seeds, seaweed-based bio fertilisers) or value-added products (food, textiles, cosmetics, medicine) from unconventional crops Ecosystem restoration technologies for forests, mangroves, and coral reefs: Examples include seed planting drones and reef tiles (software management systems for managing the cash flows of forest restoration against the success of replanting efforts) Measurement technologies for biodiversity or ecosystem health: Environmental DNA, acoustic- or hyperspectral-based IoT sensors, or remote sensing algorithms. Sustainable travel-related companies (eco-lodge operators or travel booking platforms) Enforcement technologies for conservation areas (technologies that can detect illegal logging or forest fires in real-time). <br/>The Biodiversity Accelerator+ targets eight companies for the first cohort. Preference will be given to companies based/with operations in Southeast Asia or interested in expanding to the region. 'Southeast Asia is a biocultural hotspot with an enormous variety of beautiful, natural habitats. I feel it is our duty and responsibility to protect what is left and restore what was once there,' he said. <br/>At the end of the programme, participants can unlock investments of up to US$250,000 each and access a vast network of impact investors. <br/>'We want to build the stack of 'biodiversity-positive' investible opportunities for ourselves and other investors. We have met with many passionate and talented entrepreneurs who we feel could benefit from a holistic and comprehensive programme covering their businesses' financial, social, and environmental aspects. We want to help these founders upskill and help their early-stage companies become more investment-ready,' he elaborated. <br/>Also Read: 5 reasons why impact investing is becoming mainstream investing[3] <br/>The partners of Biodiversity Accelerator+ are Temasek Foundation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Mandai Nature, UBS Optimus Foundation, Conservation International Ventures, Wavemaker Impact, REAPRA, NUS Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, the Meloy Fund, Be The Earth Foundation, Systemiq, Beanstalk, Cell VC, Shook Lin &amp; Bok, and Kindrik Partners. <br/>These partners will help the accelerator with shortlisting and selecting the companies, leading group sessions, and being mentors to the founders of companies. They would potentially be co-investing with Silverstrand at the end. <br/>The selection of finalists will be conducted jointly by the Silverstrand investment committee and the external experts on its shortlisting committee, including Kavita Prakash-Mani, CEO of Mandai Nature, and Peter Kennedy, Partner at the Meloy Fund. <br/>Silverstrand has a network of experienced coaches and speakers from different backgrounds to help the startups with traditional accelerator aspects (fundraising, financial modelling and branding) and impact aspects (understanding the science of biodiversity and how to work with local communities). <br/>'We want our participating companies to use the knowledge gained to guide better their business and financial planning and their approach to the ecosystems and communities in which they operate. Ultimately, we want our companies to achieve a 'triple bottom line' of financial, social and environmental returns,' Chiu remarked. <br/>\u2014 <br/>Fundraising or preparing your startup for fundraising?

But a new documentary film, Living Wine, hopes to change that trite discussion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The film, which opens in selected US theatres on Friday (Jul 15), focuses on a small group of natural wine producers in California. It examines, with far more nuance than is typical, the myriad reasons they choose to work in natural wine, along with the many rationales for consumers to drink it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In this context, natural wine is presented neither as a trend nor a generational emblem. Involvement is a conscious choice. Though their reasons may overlap, each of the producers in the film has a different point of emphasis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Gideon Beinstock and Saron Rice of Clos Saron in the Sierra Foothills make wine without additives because they believe that method makes the best wines and offers the best expression of their vineyard.</p><p> \"The fact that we don't add anything is not because it's natural,\" Beinstock said. \"It's because, why would I add anything? It will not improve the wine.\"</p><p> Darek Trowbridge of Old World Winery in the Russian River Valley believes in the traditional methods embodied by his ancestors, who planted a vineyard in the area almost 100 years ago, before chemical farming became the norm. He wants to express the distinctive terroirs of his vineyards, but he sees himself as a custodian of nature, too, a role that he holds sacred.</p><p> \"I try to work to do good on my farm for the land, for the ecosystem,\" he said. \"Where I reside spiritually is where I want to reside as a farmer and not separate the two.\"</p><p> For Megan Bell of Margins Wines, who shares a production facility outside Santa Cruz with James Jelks of Flor\u00e8z Wines, the reasons are more political, born of her demeaning experiences as a young woman in a male-dominated winery in Napa Valley.</p><p> \"I hated my job,\" she said. \"I loved what I physically did, but the culture and the way that I was treated, I dreaded going to work every day. Nobody wants to be at work when their abilities are doubted constantly.\"</p><p> The reasons to make natural wines are primarily cultural for Dani Rozman of La Onda, in the Sierra Foothills. He wants to wean Americans from the notion that the American wine industry traces directly to modern Europe. Instead, he wants to focus on North and South America, and their centuries of shared grape-growing and winemaking history that began when Spanish missionaries planted the list\u00e1n prieto, or mission, grape in the Americas.</p><p>  Having worked with farmers in Chile gave him insight into alternatives to mainstream winemaking. \"All the equipment is developed to make winemaking easier, but that doesn't make it better,\" he said.</p><p> Following their personal muses, these producers have all ended up outside conventional winemaking, and have gravitated to styles of farming without chemical fertilisers and sprays, while employing traditional, preindustrial production methods.</p><p> Climate crisis Looming over all is the climate crisis, which in California has caused intense heat waves, drought and repeated threats of deadly, destructive fires. Over the course of filming, each of these producers was directly affected by the fires.</p><p> While these winemakers do not say they work specifically to combat climate change, the film addresses the vast harm that conventional agriculture has exacted on ecosystems and the climate. It also holds out hope that, if the world could step away from chemical farming and focus on building soil health and other regenerative methods, agriculture could be an important part of the solution.</p><p> Lori Miller, the producer and director of Living Wine, said she was drawn to these subjects because they work on the fringe. \"I love telling stories about people outside the normal corporate world, people who are not playing the game but are inspired from within,\" she said. \"This story fell within the mould.\"</p><p> Though Miller, whose producer credits include They Came to Play and Shakespeare High, counts herself as a food and wine lover, she knew little about natural wine before beginning this project.</p><p> Her brother, Ben Miller, and his family had moved into a new home outside Santa Rosa, which came with a vineyard. They were dismayed to learn that the vineyard had been regularly sprayed with the herbicide glyphosate, which could have seeped into the well that supplied their household water. He was introduced to Trowbridge, who began the process of weaning the vineyard from chemical treatments.</p><p> \"That was the impetus for learning more about this,\" Lori Miller said. \"I started looking into the wines I was buying, and I had no idea.\"</p><p> Lori Miller imagines that those who watch the film might be very much like her, hyperconscious about where their food comes from but giving little thought to the wine. The first words in Living Wine come from Trowbridge:</p><p> \"The natural wine movement is about 20 years behind the organic food movement,\" he said. \"You can't see the processing, but typically wine is a manufactured, machine-driven product. That means adjuncts to make it work in a timely manner.</p><p> \"People just don't understand that,\" he continued. \"I didn't know that until I got a master's degree in winemaking.\"</p><p> With the help of 2 proponents of regenerative agriculture, Elizabeth Candelario and Timothy LaSalle, the film traces the rise of chemical agriculture to the repurposing of closed munitions factories after World War II. Nitrogen that went into bombs was instead used to make fertiliser, while nerve gas became an ingredient in pesticides.</p><p> With the support of the government and Big Agriculture, students and farmers were taught an industrialised form of agriculture to increase production. The industrial methods resulted in far more specialised farming rather than in the more natural, complex ecosystems of pre-industrial farming, and built a dependency on Big Ag corporations.</p><p> \"Nature only works in whole systems,\" LaSalle said. \"She can't work separated out. When you bring something in, it changes and causes unexpected consequences.\"</p><p> The film never loses the thread between agriculture and wine, which in many people's minds is simply a product on a supermarket shelf.</p><p> \"Every form of agriculture is detrimental to the environment, on any scale, even a garden, but we try to minimise the footprint,\" Beinstock said.</p><p> Their winemaking facilities are rustic, far from the wealthy tourist outposts in the popular imagination. They are designed for work, and the labor is difficult. The motivation is more personal expression than profit, yet choosing to work outside the mainstream is stressful in its own ways.</p><p> \"I'm at a spot still where I've been on food stamps for a year and I still have other jobs,\" said Bell, of Margins Wines. \"Because I'm putting all my money into my business.\"</p><p> Adjusting to natural wines As for natural wines themselves, the film acknowledges that consumers may require time to adjust to them because of expectations that arise from years of drinking commonplace examples, just as a farm-raised tomato might prove shocking to one accustomed to glossy supermarket tomatoes.</p><p> At a tasting contrasting conventional and natural chardonnays, one consumer described the conventional bottle as \"all the things you're programmed to expect in a chardonnay\". The natural example was different, she said, but was \"probably a more true expression of what the actual grape is\".</p><p> Like a good natural wine, the film is not without some minor blemishes. It is too black-and-white in its portrait of conventional wine, for one, which offers far more of a spectrum of approaches.</p><p> But the idealism, selflessness and commitment of the growers and producers is inspiring. Though, as the film states, natural wine accounts for less than 1 per cent of the wine produced in California, they have chosen to act on principle rather than resign themselves in despair.</p><p> What the film offers in the end is not a formula for the good life, a cliche of California wine country, but a way of living well and reflectively. </p><p> Climate chaos can be overwhelming, but Miller hopes that the film will be motivational. \"You can make a difference even if you're only farming a few acres, or composting in your yard or have a small colony of bees,\" she said. \"I hope showcasing people who aren't giving up will be inspiring.\" NYTIMES</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["\"People just don't understand that,\" he continued. \"I didn't know that until I got a master's degree in winemaking.

It is a niche still but it is a matter of time before it becomes a trend, then mainstream.\"</p><p> These days the buzzwords emerging from the 170-year-old firm that has its roots in the United States but is now Singapore-headquartered, run to things like a strict no-no for GMO, which is short for genetically modified organisms, and going beyond organic fertilisers to \"regenerative agriculture\".</p><p> Such issues feature among the six promises Dole held out to the world. These also include zero fruit waste and zero processed sugar in all products by 2025, giving one billion people access to nutritious food by that year, and increasing the company's value to all stakeholders - employees included - by the same time. Dole Sunshine is also targeting carbon neutrality by 2030.</p><p> Mr Rupen Desai, global chief marketing officer of Dole Packaged Foods, has been quoted saying his company is putting a big wager on the \"conscience economy\" where more and more people make \"wallet choices based on beliefs\".</p><p> Combining responsible corporate behaviour with great marketing savvy, the attitude is best captured in the text in an advertisement from Dole Packaged Foods: \"We deserve the world we live in. Our children don't.\"</p><p> Dole's Asia fresh produce business, along with the worldwide packaged foods business, was acquired for US$1.68 billion by Japan's Itochu Corp in December 2012. Itochu's eyes possibly fell on Dole because Japan is the No. 1 importer of banana and pineapple in Asia, and Itochu itself is the top importer for the home market.</p><p> Since the takeover, Itochu, whose history goes back to 1858, has introduced to Dole the very Japanese concept of sampo-yoshi - the harmonious blending of the interests of the seller, buyer and society. That's communicated as people, profit and planet.</p><p> Sometimes, says Mr Wiegele, this triple commitment has come with a price. Dole Sunshine, for instance, decided this year not only to build medical infrastructure for its Covid-19-struck workforce in General Santos City, Mindanao, but also to privately fund vaccinations for thousands upon thousands of its employees in the Philippines.</p><p> Likewise, the resolve to use non-fossil ingredients for packaging in what admittedly is not a very high margin business - \"The current solutions are all expensive but we sacrifice the higher-cost packaging in order to do the right thing.\"</p><p>   &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Fast facts&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;   &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;THE EXECUTIVE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; Mr Christian Wiegele is president of Fresh Produce Group at Dole Sunshine Company. He previously worked at Coca-Cola Co in various roles in Austria, Italy, Belgium and Singapore. His last position there was finance director for supply management and procurement. Mr Wiegele is 51 and speaks five languages. Born in Spain to Austrian parents, he has a Master of Business Administration from the Vienna University of Economics and Business. Mr Wiegele and his Scottish wife are parents of a girl and two boys, aged 19, 18 and 15. Aside from running, he counts hiking and music as key hobbies.   &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;THE COMPANY&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; Dole Sunshine Company is a Singapore-headquartered multinational food and beverage company. It represents the combined global interests of Dole Asia Holdings, Food &amp; Beverages Group and Fresh Produce Group. It has an annual turnover of US$2.6 billion (S$3.5 billion). Dole Sunshine has approximately 25,000 employees, almost all of them in Asia. With roots going back to the United States, where it was founded in 1851, the firm is now wholly owned by Itochu Corp of Japan. It is so named because it believes that like sunshine, good and healthy food should be available to all. In June last year, Dole committed to making nutritious foods accessible to one billion people. The company is moving towards zero fruit loss and zero fossil-fuel-based plastic packaging by 2025, and net zero carbon emissions by 2030.  </p><p> For the 51-year-old Mr Wiegele, the Dole position is something of an epiphany after nearly two decades with Coca-Cola Co. While he sees Coca-Cola as an exceptionally well-run firm, there is no denying that the sugared drinks it sells aren't possibly great for health. His corporate heroes, he says, are people like former Unilever chief executive Paul Polman, who brought great thought leadership and purpose to the fast-moving consumer goods giant, and newer firms such as outdoors clothing company Patagonia.</p><p> As Patagonia stresses, responsible consumption is just as important as responsible production. It's an important reminder for food companies, which can see as much as a third of their food going to waste in the supply chain, often due to poor storage conditions.</p><p> Dole Sunshine, he says, has strong initiatives working on reducing waste, repurposing products and upcycling. A year ago, a lot of waste would have gone into landfills, now it is being repurposed with new technology. A new venture in the fold works solely on enzymes and by-products of pineapple waste. Through another joint venture, Dole is helping to turn pineapple leaves into animal-free leather. Dole also is working to extend the shelf life of products - a week gained in a month is a 25 per cent gain on shelf life, critical as global temperatures rise. Dole acknowledges that it does not have all the answers, but is committed to getting there.</p><p> Of the six Dole promises, the ones proving easier to meet are those relating to zero fruit losses and zero processed sugar added to products, he says. The most challenging is zero fossil-based packaging and regenerative agriculture. For these two, the company will need to look outside for the technology.</p><p> I wonder if it helps the price point to have Japanese ownership. Whiskies made by Suntory, for instance, command a premium in the spirits market than ones of equivalent age bottled in Scotland.</p><p> Mr Wiegele smiles at the question and avoids a direct answer. \"From our perspective,\" he says, \"the key messaging is around the naturalness of food. Our core market is Japan, still the biggest.\"</p><p> Indeed, Dole has introduced Japan-focused high-end bananas, called gokusen, which are sweeter, creamier and more fragrant than regular bananas. Grown in altitudes higher than 600m, the gokusen, which retails in Japan at 298 yen apiece or S$3.60, also tend to be smaller than regular bananas. Dole is soon introducing the fruit to other markets, such as China and Singapore.</p><p> Mr Wiegele's career at Coca-Cola revolved around increasingly higher finance responsibilities in Europe and Asia. With that skill set in hand, I wonder if Dole would deploy his financial acumen to raise capital for its expansion. Olam International, another Singapore-based food giant, recently announced plans to sell shares in London for its hived-off food ingredients unit. Part of Olam's reasons to go to London was that it expects investors and analysts there to have a better appreciation of its attempts to offer more sustainably grown products, with better traceability enhancing the product's transparency.</p><p> \"Currently, there are no plans to bring in additional investors,\" says Mr Wiegele. \"At the same time, we believe we need to bring our house in order and deliver on all the Dole promises, most of which come due in 2025. We believe we can deliver better growth internally without dilution. I don't wish to speculate beyond 2025.\"</p><p> What about emerging technologies? It is now commonly said that agritech is the new fintech. Lighting companies such as Philips are sprouting divisions that target the agriculture business, because light is so critical to plant growth.</p><p> Mr Wiegele says new technologies such as vertical farming offer complementary opportunities and Dole indeed is interested in examining them. However, he says, while this may work in, say, strawberry cultivation, pineapples and bananas are a different game.</p><p> \"You can't do them on an economic scale in that (controlled) environment.\"</p><p> Born in Spain to Austrian parents and educated in Vienna, Mr Wiegele often spent summer breaks working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as orphan caregiver Nuestros Pequenos Hermanos in Mexico, Care International in post-SovietUkraine, and a hospital project in the Russian Far East.</p><p> Indeed, he was so caught up with the work that as a 16-year-old, he bet a case of beer with his friends that he would never study business administration. As it turned out, that was indeed what he would ultimately study.</p><p> The NGO work, he says, gave him the insight that business offered unique opportunities to transform local communities. As it happens, Dole Sunshine's plantations are in areas that have seen some of the worst conflicts - Mindanao in the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka.</p><p> Sustainable livelihoods are often the best solutions in conflict areas, he says. The solution to stability is often economic stability, and that starts with employment stability.</p><p> \"Dole has made a clear commitment that we will provide a living wage that is higher than the minimum wage required in every geography. It is a big, audacious goal and we are committed to it.\"</p><p> Fluent in five languages, including Russian and Italian, Mr Wiegele says his language skills have helped him acquire cultural sensitivity. It has also helped him articulate complex thoughts in simple words - communication being so important in running a business enterprise.</p><p> Married to a Scotswoman, the Wiegeles have a girl and two boys, aged between 19 and 15. He says running - without earplugs and other gadgets - is a favourite hobby. Dole itself sponsors marathons in Asia.</p><p> There is something to be said about padding along early in the morning on a Shanghai street, Singapore's East Coast or Colombo's Galle Face Green. It is a great way to commune with nature, and the world.</p><p> Besides, if you tire and need instant, healthy nourishment, you can always reach for a Dole banana.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["And the third element people look for is sustainability - consumers are looking for purpose-driven products.

To meet, motivate and connect with staff in these places after a two-year absence enforced by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p> \"It's showing myself and talking about strategy, business, the future, everything,\" he says in rapid-fire English.</p><p> It is the best way for him to learn how to manage the company, he says.</p><p> \"They are the ones close to the clients. I can look at the numbers, but they tell you a story that is not quite complete, right? But when you go into a shop and look, listen to the people and see what they do and how they do it, you can immediately tell if the shop has an energy or not,\" says Mr Bizzarri. </p><p> The importance of personal interaction with shop staff is extremely important because it is an opportunity for him to tell the story of Gucci, and show and share his passion for the brand.</p><p> \"Of course, (the staff) like to see me, shake my hand and be recognised. If I'm able to do this, it's clear that this person will deliver the best possible service for Gucci and to the person in front of him... The reward of the people and the way we are going to deliver for Gucci is going to be amazing,\" says the man hailed by many in the corporate world as a visionary leader and one of the sharpest minds in the fashion industry.</p><p> Reversing company's fortunesThe economics and finance graduate from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia cut his teeth as a consultant with Accenture in 1986 and went on to resuscitate and grow companies including Stella McCartney and Bottega Veneta before joining Gucci in late 2014. </p><p> Mr Bizzarri is credited not just with reversing the fortunes of the then-ailing fashion house -- he turned the company around in just one year and grew Gucci's annual sales from EUR3.9 billion (S$5.5 billion) in 2015 to EUR9.7 billion in 2021 -- but making it one of the most progressive companies with enlightened policies on sustainability and inclusivity, as well as forays into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse. </p><p> The company is now the main label and profit engine of luxury conglomerate Kering, which also owns, among other luxe fashion brands, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta. </p><p> China -- which reportedly accounts for around 35 per cent of Gucci's annual sales and which is still affected by numerous rounds of Covid-19 lockdowns -- may have blunted its stellar growth this year, but sales still rose by 4 per cent in the second quarter.</p><p> Mr Bizzarri recalls Italy being hit hard, with shops, factories and product development areas closed, when the pandemic first struck two years ago.</p><p> \"So I told myself after 10 days, 'I know I cannot control Covid, I'm not a doctor, so I need to accept this.'\"</p><p> But he decided to use the downtime as an opportunity to review company strategy. Among other measures, he cut the number of wholesalers in Europe by two-thirds because they were fuelling the parallel market, turned other wholesale businesses including duty-free shops into concessionaires to control pricing and reinforce brand equity, and made key strategic and management appointments. </p><p> \"I took the occasion to do more for the brand because I think going forward, Gucci needs to be on a sustainable trajectory, one not influenced too much by fashion and the external scenario,\" he says, adding that it was more important to strengthen the legacy of the company.</p><p> The ability to change and be nimble is imperative, especially in the fashion industry which he describes as \"a business of change\".</p><p> \"We set the main trends for the future to be long-term or short-term, according to the way in which you interpret the standard scenarios. But in a way, you cannot stay stuck in the moment. If you think that what you did six months ago, three months ago, is the right thing to do, then you're dead.\"</p><p> Since fashion is about looking into the future, taking risks which could result in mistakes, he says, is par for the course.</p><p> \"It's part of the game. If you play safe, you're dead again. It's the mantra of the company.\"</p><p>Italian approach to luxuryProudly, he says Gucci -- which employs about 22,000 employees and operates nearly 500 stores globally -- is the only Italian luxury company of its size in the world.</p><p> \"The only other big ones are French. The way we approach luxury is totally different and we want to remain different. First of all, we are Italians and proud to be Italians. We are crazy and we want to innovate,\" he says with a hearty laugh.</p><p> \"I also get bored extremely quickly. My star sign is Leo and I was born in the Chinese year of the tiger, so I'm double feline,\" he adds, eyes twinkling.</p><p> His insatiable curiosity naturally leads him to seek out those who are curious too.</p><p> \"I prefer people who directly challenge me. It doesn't mean that I like it. I don't like to be challenged, but I want to be challenged. There is a difference.\"</p><p> With a rueful laugh, he laments: \"It's difficult, this thing with human beings. We want to have people in front of us to tell us exactly what we think. It is a part of life. But then you think, 'Is this what I want? I mean, how can I grow'' It's like having a twin in front of you telling you exactly the same thing that you say. We will remain the same person forever.\"</p><p> Forays into NFTs His disdain for inertia is the reason Gucci has been making trailblazing moves into NFTs and the metaverse. </p><p> Early in 2022, it partnered with digital character brand Superplastic to launch a SuperGucci NFT collection, which combined classic Gucci motifs and designs with Superplastic digital characters Janky and Guggimon. </p><p> In May, it launched a permanent space, Gucci Town in gaming platform Roblox, with which it had collaborated previously on more short-lived ventures, including Gucci Garden in 2021.</p><p> One of Mr Bizzarri's latest moves was the appointment in September of a chief executive of vault and metaverse ventures who will, among other responsibilities, explore the fashion house's presence in online ventures such as gaming.</p><p> \"I'm not a digital native. So I need to learn to understand. I have kids and one of them is a gamer... they are a different generation,\" says Mr Bizzarri, who has two sons and a daughter aged between 21 and 28. </p><p> So piqued was he by the digital world that he visited Silicon Valley in California where he met many Web3 entrepreneurs. </p><p> \"The beauty is that none of them knows what is going to be the future of the metaverse. But everyone wants to work for it, and all the money is going into it. They know something's going to happen, but they don't know what or when or how they are going to survive and be successful.</p><p> \"So I prefer to be there learning, with the company learning with me. When something happens, we're going to be ready, or at least we're going to have people in the company who know the metaverse and know Gucci as well. With that combination, we're going to make a difference.\"</p><p> He chuckles when asked if being first mover comes with risks and if there is a thin line between taking risks and being reckless.</p><p> He recalls the moment in 2015 when he stunned the fashion industry by appointing dark horse Alessandro Michele to be Gucci's creative director. </p><p> \"Was I taking a risk or being reckless? I don't know. When you bet, what happens can be extremely bad. But my feeling was that it was the right decision to take. And I would regret that all my life if I didn't do it.\"</p><p> His bet paid off handsomely. Apparently on the verge of resigning from Gucci where he had worked for 12 years when he was made creative director, Michele's contemporary design flair and intimate understanding of the brand's historical codes have since given the house a new narrative and a new lease of life. </p><p> He came up with new interpretations of some of the house's beloved bags, including the Jackie (made famous by the former first lady of the United States Jackie Onassis), the Bamboo, the Diana and the Attache. </p><p> His latest coup is a witty Valigeria campaign featuring Hollywood A-lister Ryan Gosling, and the Gucci Savoy collection of luggage and accessories which debuted in 1921.</p><p> Mr Bizzarri is extremely chuffed with the campaign, and others before it.</p><p> \"The idea is really to continue to play the role of fashion innovator but also to inject the company's legacy, but always in a way uniquely ours.\"</p><p> Coming back to Michele, he says: \"I saw potential creativity, I saw something that I thought he was able to do. So I felt that he was the right one instead of the other ones whom I interviewed. That has taught me something: It's better to be fired for a decision that you took than for a decision someone has taken for you.\"</p><p> He has a simple recipe for spotting talent: curiosity, an interesting brain and chemistry.</p><p> \"It's always important to have around you people that you like. Life is already hard enough. I mean, there are so many things that you need to do. \"</p><p> Inclusivity and sustainabilityUnder his leadership, Gucci has also become a trailblazer for its stand on inclusivity -- \"diversity without inclusivity doesn't mean anything\" -- and sustainability.</p><p> The two concepts, he says, are interlinked.</p><p> \"This planet and people, they go together. You need to respect the people and you need to make sure that their work in the company is valued and sustainable. And you want to maintain this world for them and this job for them. And also you need to make sure they can live a good life.\"</p><p> Gucci's latest environmental profit and loss results showed that since 2015, the company has reduced its total footprint by 49 per cent, covering greenhouse gas emissions, water use, air and water pollution, waste and land use. </p><p> In the last couple of years, it has also been investing in regenerative agriculture, and launched Demetra, an innovative animal-free material which it now uses across the house's collections. </p><p> Another novel initiative is its Gucci Changemakers programme, launched about three years ago. Candidly, Mr Bizzarri lets on that the company suffered a public backlash after it released a sweater featuring a roll-up collar which covers the lower face and has a wide red lip outline around the mouth. The item was pulled from stores and the website after complaints about the sweater's resemblance to blackface.</p><p> The faux pas happened because the Italian design team was not America-centric, he says. </p><p> \"I went to Wikipedia to understand what it was,\" he says, adding that he created Gucci Changemakers so that \"information about potential impact (and issues including) cultural appropriation was widespread (and available) everywhere in the company\".</p><p>  He adds: \"I don't work in fashion to hurt people. I work in fashion to make people's lives better.\"</p><p> There is also a volunteering component to the programme which supports and empowers staff to contribute to their local communities by taking part in causes -- from championing social justice to supporting health and well-being -- close to their hearts.</p><p> \"So the change machine was born from something that was a problem for us, but it became one of the greatest strengths of the company,\" he says.</p><p> He reckons he took on the job of leading Gucci at the right time. Stints in consulting and at Bottega Veneta and Stella McCartney had given him \"the capability to take decisions and to have the knowledge and the stability to take an issue and protect the decision\".</p><p> \"When you take a decision, it's important not to change and say 'it's the wrong decision' at the first sign of trouble. You need to stay in it to give the decision time to nurture.\"</p><p> If he had been given the Gucci post five years earlier, he believes he would not have had the experience and maturity to do as sterling a job.</p><p> Turning philosophical, Mr Bizzarri says: \"In life, there's a time and a season for everything.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["And also you need to make sure they can live a good life.

But we can grow trees, green our cities, rewild our gardens, change our diets and clean up rivers and coasts. We are the generation that can make peace with nature,\" the world body says.</p><p> Globally, there are growing efforts to start restoring damaged environments, from replanting mangroves and forests, creating more parks and gardens in cities, and growing food in ways that do not damage the land but rather help restore local wildlife and the carbon content of soils - regenerative agriculture.</p><p> Urban farms are popping up on rooftops or on vacant land amid housing estates, bringing nature back into the urban landscape. Many people who live in cities lose a connection with nature because all of life's essentials can be found at the turn of a tap or in a local food market as well as the safety and shelter of a warm house.</p><p> But Covid-19 has helped people reconnect with nature as many seek the peace of the green outdoors to exercise and take time out from busy, confined lives.</p><p> This connection is an essential reminder that nature provides the key services that we all rely on: clean water, air and food.</p><p> We need clean rivers and healthy forest watersheds for water, and forests and healthy oceans for oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. We need healthy soils to grow food. Yet, about a quarter of the world's land is degraded and climate change is triggering more extreme droughts, heatwaves and floods that disrupt crop production.</p><p> We also need healthy coral reefs and mangroves for productive fisheries. Yet coral reefs are in trouble around the world from water pollution, over-fishing, acidification of sea water and, most critically, warmer ocean temperatures that cause the corals to bleach white. More than 450 million people in more than 100 countries rely on coral reefs for their livelihoods.</p><p> Mangroves protect coastlines from erosion and rising sea levels. They are also vital fish nurseries and soak up large amounts of CO2, making them a great natural climate solution. Yet mangroves are being cleared for development such as shrimp farms. Asean has lost a third of its mangroves between 1980 and 2020, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's Global Forest Resources Assessment.</p><p> Efforts are under way, though, to restore mangroves in Asean, especially Indonesia, as well as steps to reverse some of the years of damage to tropical peat swamp forests. There are also measures to address the plastic waste crisis in the region.</p><p> But much more is needed, says the UNEP, to avoid irreversible damage. The world is facing three simultaneous crises - on climate, biodiversity and pollution - all of which are interconnected and caused by human action.</p><p> Nature needs to take a seat in the boardrooms of all companies - businesses need to find ways to grow without trashing the environment. Pressure is growing on banks and multilateral lenders to look at how their money will be used and not give it to firms whose activities damage the environment and risk local livelihoods.</p><p> Increasingly, investors are looking at nature-based solutions to earn money while saving the environment. UNEP has said global annual spending to protect and restore nature needs to triple this decade to about US$350 billion (S$464.3 billion) by 2030 and rise to US$536 billion by 2050. Getting there requires a shift in mindset among financiers, businesses and governments.</p><p> UNEP's inaugural State of Finance for Nature report estimated that US$8 trillion in investment would be needed by mid-century to safeguard natural systems. \"It's peanuts when we are frankly talking about securing the planet and our very own future,\" said Ms Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director.</p><p> Report co-author Ivo Mulder, who heads UNEP's climate finance unit, said financial flows should work with nature, not against it.</p><p> \"It is more an opportunity to see how can you continue to do business, how can governments continue to grow economically - but do so in a way that is more equitable and sustainable.

For 2 years, Covid-19 has shocked the very systems on which we rely, overlaying and influencing a set of wide-ranging changes and transitions - both positive and negative - that were already shaping the 2020s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As we look forward to 2030, the target year for the realisation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and a key milestone for rapid reductions in carbon emissions, will we find ourselves in a just, resilient and sustainable world - or one in which we witness ever more destabilising shocks on a pathway to a hot-house earth'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In order to answer this question, it's timely to take another look at the four different pathways or trajectories towards 2030 that Forum for the Future identified 15 months ago in our From System Shock to System Change - Time to Transform report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These trajectories were based on the mindsets we were seeing proliferate in response to the pandemic, and provided us with a framework for looking at how the world might proactively shift on to a more transformative footing - not just building back better, but actively looking to build forward into a new future.</p><p> They were:</p><p>Compete and Retreat: Characterised by a retreat into national borders driven by the perception that there is not enough to go around, resulting in the strengthening of existing nationalist dynamics, the gradual collapse of what's left of globalisation and international collaboration, and the emergence of fragmented regionalism.Discipline: Characterised by greater state control to manage public health and safety, resulting in the ramped-up use of technology for automation, remote connection, surveillance and control, as well as a concurrent sacrifice of personal privacy, in order to keep growth and global interconnection going as 'normal'.Transform: Characterised by a growing understanding of the deep connections between human and planetary health, using the pandemic recovery as a 'reset' to catalyse a fair and equitable zero-carbon transition and a shift towards new business and economic models based on resilience and regenerative thinking.Unsettled: Characterised by a continued inability to settle on a 'new normal' due to ongoing discontinuity and disruption from crises of all kinds: climate and ecological, political, social, economic and technological. Recognising that many previous ways of thinking are no longer helpful, Unsettled presents an urgent need to adjust and adapt to a difficult and strange reality - one in which resilience, adaptability and opportunism constantly jostle with fatalism and anxiety.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, all four trajectories are still in play. Taking each in turn:</p><p> Within Compete and Retreat we're seeing intensifying energy geopolitics and resource hoarding; vaccine hoarding in pursuit of national interests; nationalist populism continuing to gain traction; the resurgence of local forces such as the Taliban; the closure of borders to migrants and polarising debate on immigration policy.</p><p> Where Compete and Retreat overlaps with Discipline, we're seeing growing autocracy and new impunity for dictators.</p><p> Within Discipline alone, we've seen the accelerated use of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation; vaccine passports; the normalisation of authoritarian lockdown politics; increasing surveillance capacities by governments; use of spyware and more.</p><p> Turning to Transform, signs of purely transformational change include: Berlin's rethinking of the car; ecocide laws being drafted in respect of the rights of nature; governments being sued by young people whose voices are only growing louder in the climate activism movement; four-day weeks being trialled in a shake-up of how we work; growing energy behind grassroots democracy, as seen with the rise of citizen assemblies and protest movements in support of democratic values; changing diets, particularly in the West; and advances in regeneration, not least the resurgence of regenerative agriculture.</p><p> Where Discipline also overlaps with Transform, we're seeing the growth of nature-based solutions often spearheaded by corporates; growing interest in corporate sustainability and climate reporting for financial institutions; satellite imaging and AI technology used in fighting deforestation.</p><p> Finally, looking at Unsettled, this has been a very dominant story of the last 15 months. We've seen crisis after crisis unfold in some nation-states. We've seen disruption to supply chains, to energy supplies, not to mention multiple waves of Covid-19 and the disruption that causes.</p><p> In many ways, a strong flavour of Unsettled in our daily lives is to be expected. Triggered both by the pandemic and by systems that were already transforming pre-Covid-19 - from food to energy - we are living in a moment of accelerated system change.</p><p> It also opens up new opportunities. For example, where Transform intersects with Unsettled, we're seeing growing people power and community influence, the maturation of new ways of organising, just transition rhetoric gaining pace and the channelling of funds to vulnerable communities.</p><p>Time to face reality, recognise we're off track and prep for further disruption</p><p> At Forum, we believe Transform must prevail - it is the trajectory that will bring about the just and regenerative future the world needs.</p><p> With Unsettled dominating right now, four things are front of mind if we're to get on track.</p><p> First, we must get real about the scale of the system transformation needed.</p><p> They are brittle and vulnerable, with one event having the potential to cause cascading impacts; think back to the disruption caused by a single ship blocking one part of the Suez Canal. In Part 2 of our Looking Back to Go Forward series, John Elkington elegantly referred to the 'decomposition of our systems'. It's a clear sign of the huge task ahead of us if we are to create new, resilient systems capable of sustaining both planetary and human health.</p><p> Second: be honest about the effort this will take and just how far off we are from where we need to be. Johan Rockstrom spoke of us being at the 'end of the road' following three decades of putting unsustainable pressure on the planet. It's easy to see Transform as a distant dream right now and we must all do more, faster if we're to create the future we all want.</p><p> Third, be ready for more uncertainty, more discontinuity. Accelerated system change is messy and often non-linear. Take for example the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy where we are currently witnessing rapid exponential change.</p><p> Adding in the features of the Unsettled trajectory means planning for disruption and for prolonged uncertainty would seem sensible. As is remembering that non-linear change can be a good thing; the speed and scale of some of our responses to the pandemic illustrate this, from the availability of a brand new vaccine to the success of public/private partnerships in converting manufacturing lines to the production of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p><p> Which is one of the reasons, why, lastly, Transform is still possible. As we head towards 2030, it is very likely that we will continue to experience Compete and Retreat, Unsettled and Discipline, as well as Transform. We can expect multiple versions of our future to be in play at any one point in time. However, if we are experiencing these different trajectories, how might we harness the energy behind them and influence what happens next'</p><p>Shifting systems means working with activating and resisting forces</p><p> In order to shift systems it is usually necessary to work with both activating forces for change (abundant in Transform), and resisting ones (think vested interests that might dominate Compete and Retreat).</p><p> Ignoring resisting forces means they will remain and keep trying to lock in the current configuration of any system. But engaging with them and understanding prevailing mindsets makes it possible to divert this energy into a different direction.</p><p> So our challenge is this: how can we leverage the shake-up created in the Unsettled trajectory to embrace new ways of living and working'</p><p> The way forward will not be easy. The wholesale systemic change we need will require coordinated efforts at multiple levels and across multiple stakeholders, each embracing innovation and shifting their fundamental mindsets.</p><p> At the same time, the resisting forces in the form of vested interests will continue to present a high risk of leaving us stuck in shallow transitions.</p><p> As a new year sets in, a just and regenerative future is within our grasp, but we need a decisive and immediate course correct to achieve it.</p><p> Our future isn't written - it is ours to write.</p><p>The writer is chief executive officer of Forum for the Future.</p><p>This article first appeared in Forum's Future of Sustainability: Looking Back to Go Forward opinion and commentary series.

Or an orang utan. Or a rainforest. And for the most part, they are invisible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Nature plays a central role in many businesses, yet it rarely gets a seat at the C-suite table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Companies have long taken for granted the resources that nature provides, from the crops grown in the soil to timber from forests to fish from the sea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Few think about the \"ecosystem services\" that societies rely on - clean air, water supply from rivers, crop pollination by insects or coastal storm protection by mangroves and coral reefs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These environmental assets and services are vital to the functioning of corporates and communities. But they are regarded as free, and existing business models, premised on this assumption, have caused over-extraction of resources, pollution, deforestation, over-fishing, declining water supplies and rapid loss of species.</p><p> All this as climate change impacts get worse and are directly affecting nature, too.</p><p> Nature is deteriorating worldwide at a faster pace than at any time in human history, triggering a biodiversity crisis. Now more than ever, nature needs that seat at the boardroom table.</p><p> Just as companies are increasingly being mandated by regulators to measure and report their climate risks and investment exposure, the same could happen in relation to nature.</p><p> Guidelines are being developed by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a global initiative. Companies will use the framework crafted by the task force to measure and regularly report their footprint on nature and disclose any risks - that is, how (and where) their businesses are dependent on nature, how their business practices are impacting ecosystems, as well as opportunities to help the natural world - and benefit the bottom line.</p><p> This detailed look will help investors and regulators get a better picture of a company and whether it needs to change, whether it faces material risks from its practices and supply chains or whether it is a nature-friendly actor worthy of investment.</p><p> This analysis could very well become mandatory in a few years, given support by Group of Seven finance ministers for the TNFD's work. The task force is backed by governments, major science bodies and representatives from companies, financial institutions and stock exchanges.</p><p> Among those helping draft the rules, due to be finalised late next year, are the Singapore Exchange and Olam International.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SYSTEMIC RISK&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;The creation of the TNFD follows the crafting of risk-reporting guidelines for climate change by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures that are now being adopted around the world, including in Singapore.</p><p> Starting next year, listed firms in Singapore will have to disclose their climate-related risks - and opportunities - based on the climate task force's guidelines.</p><p> Just as regulators and investors now see climate change as a major financial risk, the creation of the TNFD is a realisation that damage to nature equals business and systemic risk, too. So it is vital for firms to finally be transparent about their nature risks and dependencies, just as they are for climate change.</p><p> More than half of the world's economic output - US$44 trillion (S$60 trillion) of economic value generation - is highly or moderately dependent on nature, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and PwC UK said in a 2020 assessment. Construction (US$4 trillion), agriculture (US$2.5 trillion) and food and beverage (US$1.4 trillion) were the three largest industries that depend most on nature.</p><p> The global Network for Greening the Financial System acknowledged in a statement last month that \"nature-related risks, including those associated with biodiversity loss, could have significant macroeconomic implications, and that failure to account for, mitigate, and adapt to these implications is a source of risks relevant for financial stability\".</p><p> The network comprises 83 financial regulatory authorities and central banks globally, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p><p> The benefits of being nature-friendly could be immense. The WEF said in a separate report in 2020 that nature-positive solutions - ones that enhance nature - could generate an estimated US$10 trillion in new annual business value and create 395 million jobs by 2030.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;LONG OVERDUE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;The nature disclosure guidelines are long overdue, said Mr Tony Goldner, executive director of the TNFD. \"Nature is not in a position to wait and we can't afford for this to take 10 to 15 years before we start seeing scalable disclosures on nature loss and nature-related impacts,\" he said during a recent visit to Singapore.</p><p> Nature, though, is complex and hard for people to wrap their head around. Exactly how does a company measure its dependency on nature and the impacts'</p><p> The TNFD recently released its draft framework for comment and this will go through several more versions before the final one is released next year.</p><p> The draft framework splits nature up into four realms: the atmosphere, the oceans, land and fresh water. It also looks at what are called environmental assets, such as mineral and energy resources, freshwater ecosystems and renewable energy resources. It also includes services that regulate the planet, such as storm mitigation, air filtration and soil and sediment retention.</p><p> This \"natural capital\" keeps the planet, and people's lives and livelihoods, ticking along.</p><p> To help companies, the task force has created an assessment process called Leap: Locate the interface with nature; Evaluate dependencies and impacts; Assess risks and opportunities; and Prepare to respond to nature-related risks and opportunities and report to investors.</p><p> \"If companies understand how their business and enterprise value creation is driven by the ecological services on which they are reliant, then I think we can have a much clearer perspective on risk. And then we can be informing much better decisions around capital allocation,\" said Mr Goldner.</p><p> But it is going to be a steep learning curve for most companies.</p><p> Mr Goldner said \"how-to\" guidance is vital. \"If I'm a company or a financial institution, what do I do internally to start analysing these nature risks? A lot of investors and a lot of companies have said, 'This is completely new to us. We don't even know where to begin.'\"</p><p> He said the Leap process is a good starting point. But ultimately companies are going to have to build up expertise, just as they have been doing for climate risk assessments.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;CHIEF NATURE OFFICER'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Does this mean companies and financial institutions will have a chief nature officer'</p><p> Ideally, no, he says, because that risks creating a silo mentality.</p><p> \"I think we've got to move the nature agenda away from being a CSR (corporate social responsibility) focused activity into a really strategic C-suite issue because this is fundamentally about risk. And it's about opportunity.\"</p><p> And some of those opportunities tie in with fighting climate change. For instance, investments that restore mangroves.</p><p> Mangroves store up to four times more carbon than rainforests, making them a valuable tool in soaking up excess carbon dioxide emissions. Mangroves also protect shorelines from storm damage and rising seas and are vital fish nurseries.</p><p> \"Nature is not something that we deal with once we've figured out climate, but actually, nature-based solutions can be a huge part of the climate action, which everyone is very much focused on now,\" Mr Goldner said.</p><p> The Pollination Group, a global climate change investment and advisory firm, sees investing in nature as a way to help solve the biodiversity and climate crises and reap a return for investors. It also sees the value in companies assessing their supply chains for nature risks and dependencies.</p><p> \"I think as an engagement tool and an idea, it's really captured both the investor and corporate communities,\" said Ms Laura Waterford, a director at Pollination, referring to the TNFD.</p><p> A lot of larger clients, she said, \"just don't have line of sight to their supply chains. And that's exactly what the TNFD is asking them to report on\".</p><p> And a growing number of clients are also looking at investing in ways that do not damage the environment, such as regenerative agriculture, planting of mangroves and reforestation projects.</p><p> \"We have clients engaged in nature strategy across consumables, the built environment and the agriculture sector. They are thinking about it through a risk and opportunity lens,\" Ms Waterford said from Sydney.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;LITIGATION THREAT&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Companies that fail to act risk being rejected by investors. And there's another risk - litigation.</p><p> There has been a surge in climate lawsuits against governments and companies in recent years. More than 1,800 climate change-related lawsuits have been launched around the world to date, London's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment says.</p><p> The lawsuits have targeted failure of duty of care by companies and governments, as well as firms that fail to reveal the extent of climate risk exposure or are accused of greenwashing - making inflated claims of doing good when doing the opposite in reality.</p><p> \"All the categories of activist climate litigation are open to be applied in the nature space,\" said Ms Waterford, a lawyer by training who has looked at nature-based litigation. That is because in many countries there are existing environment laws that could provide \"hooks\" for nature-related litigation.</p><p> Precedents for holding directors responsible for foreseeable risks also meant business leaders could be held to account.</p><p> \"Directors do have a duty today to consider nature-related risks because they are absolutely foreseeable,\" said Ms Waterford.</p><p> But how do we know that what companies disclose is truthful'</p><p> The TNFD is already discussing with the Big Four accounting firms, which are part of the task force, about building in third-party assurance procedures, Mr Goldner said.</p><p> Ms Waterford said it was likely the TNFD will become mandatory pretty quickly and therefore company disclosures will be scrutinised by investors and regulators.</p><p> But she noted that in the interim, companies needed access to better data to properly evaluate exactly how reliant they are on nature and the risks to their supply chains. So there will be a learning period.</p><p> Time, though, is running short. With the global hunger for resources and the escalating threat from climate and biodiversity crises pressing in, companies, governments and consumers need to shift towards nature-friendly practices.</p><p> \"People have said before that we are financing ourselves into extinction, and we're all worried about saving up for pension funds and superannuation funds. But for what sort of future, if, in fact, we've destroyed the very ecology on which our prosperity is dependent'\" said Mr Goldner.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["A lot of larger clients, she said, \"just don't have line of sight to their supply chains.

With the world's increasing population disrupting agriculture supply chains, aggravated further by the COVID-19 pandemic, MaGIC and Deloitte have identified not only an increased need to address challenges in the food security space, but also opportunities for tech solution providers to develop new and unique innovations that can be adopted by the agriculture industry. </p><p><br/> This year, the two institutions collaborated on a roundtable discussion called the Agriculture/Agritech Roundtable and a thought leadership paper titled the 'Emerging Tech &amp; Innovation in Malaysia's Agricultural Landscape[1]' to highlight technological solutions for pressing agriculture issues that have the potential to impact millions of lives. The roundtable initiative seeks to highlight the urgency of solving problems in the agriculture space and the need to have all hands on deck \u2014 particularly tech companies that already possess the tools needed to help bolster and embolden food security. <br/> Khalid Yashaiya, Acting CEO of MaGIC, said that without intervention from new innovations, the world will soon face a food security crisis of unprecedented scale. Rural communities tied to the agriculture sector are especially fragile, having already suffered from loss of income and livelihood during the pandemic. <br/> 'The agriculture sector has been impacted by high market demand, higher production costs due to their dependence on imported goods, declining productivity and revenue, and other challenges which have led to losses in earnings. Despite this, the agriculture sector has a high potential of becoming a major contributor to the increase in shared prosperity and food resources to the world's 9.7 billion population by 2050,' he added. <br/>Malaysia and Agritech Solutions <br/>Khalid highlighted that as it is, Malaysia is abound with solutions anchored on looming issues in agriculture. The country is not lacking when it comes to innovators, from manufacturers of agriculture drones to developers of solutions that enable farmers to sort high quality vegetables, ready to take on the challenges faced by the sector. <br/> 'This is why it is crucial for the government and its agencies to encourage and facilitate this growth,' he said, adding that MaGIC empowers innovative startups by developing a vibrant and sustainable entrepreneurship ecosystem in Malaysia and accelerating their commercialisation journeys. <br/> Also read: Harnessing the power of AI to help improve gastric cancer detection[2] <br/> Justin Ong, Executive Director of Deloitte Southeast Asia and Innovation Leader of Deloitte Malaysia, further said that today's Industry 4.0 offered the perfect opportunity for agriculture players to adopt mature technologies that boost productivity and efficiency. Startups, being the source of new technologies, will be the locomotive of change. <br/> 'The agriculture industry is traditionally labour-intensive. This gives rise to many opportunities for innovative solutions and digitalisation. With their outside-the-box thinking, unconventional way and readiness to adopt new technology and business models, startups disrupt the industry with ideas that close the gap and increase productivity,' he said. <br/>What's sprouting in Malaysia? <br/>Drones, Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and online sales platforms have emerged as crucial innovations for agriculture. Malaysia already has homegrown startups focused on deploying those technologies, as these three startups exemplify. <br/>Braintree Technologies<br/>Braintree Technologies is a local startup that offers drone-as-a-service for plantation mapping, evaluation, design, and planning. The drones run on AI-powered computer vision algorithms that increase precision and automation leading to optimal yield and cost-efficiencies. <br/> 'We build agriculture robots at Braintree Technologies. Right now, we are focusing our solutions for the oil palm &amp; chilli industries. We are building chilli-picking robots and pest-control robots. We offer our solution as Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) and our clients pay us per hectare of the job done by the robots,' said Arif Makhdzir, Founder and CEO of Braintree Technologies. <br/> Additionally, the increasing use of technology can make the sector more interesting to high-skilled youth. 'My plan is to see a new generation of farmers who are less than 40 years old and they earn lucrative income by just operating their automated farm from anywhere in the world from their phone,' he said. <br/> Makhdzir finds that MaGIC's roundtable initiative is a great platform to hear the perspectives of different parties from varied backgrounds like big plantations, startups, and government, with the hopes of turning the discussion outcomes of the discussion into actual National Agrofood Policy. 'I think it benefits us to have the point of view from varied backgrounds and if we can collaborate to create a better ecosystem,' he concluded. <br/>Langit Collective <br/>Innovations are equally necessary on the consumer side. Langit Collective tackles challenges related to market access by connecting indigenous rural farming communities with consumers via online sales platforms. <br/> Lilian Chen, Co-Founder and CEO of Langit Collective, said that the startup aimed to 'create an alternative economic model for rural indigenous communities by revaluing their existing agriculture produce'. <br/> Langit Collective further empowered farmers through data collection and food chain transparency. The Food Prints Initiative is the startup's brainchild to achieve food integrity and enable consumers to learn more about the source of their rice. 'With the scanning of a unique QR code, consumers will be able to get access to the overview information of where, and who farmed the packet of rice they purchased,' she noted. <br/> Also read: Fast Forward with HPE!: Helping startups grow through community support[3] <br/> Chen expressed that MaGIC's roundtable is a great attempt to bring all the different stakeholders involved in agriculture to further understand each other's challenges in the industry. She hopes that this would lead the way to a more holistic approach in agriculture. <br/> 'In our constant pursuit in improving methodology, precision, and the need to control the environment to produce food or commodities, we become more siloed and our focus skewed only towards solving food security issues,' she said. 'I hope there is more awareness about regenerative agriculture that focuses on rebuilding ecosystems, biodiversity that regenerates the soil (carbon sequestration) whilst producing food.' <br/> Initiatives like this could be a great step for a more collaborative environment that brings better awareness and better solutions, not just to food security issues but other related issues as well. 'It can be a powerful tool to solve environmental problems whilst solving food security issues,' Chen concluded. <br/>Planting seeds for the future <br/>Braintree and Langit Collective are two of the country's budding startups whose innovations can help revolutionise the agriculture space. With these startups leading the charge and supported by reputable institutions like MaGIC, the country can inspire stronger and more collaborative efforts to help foster a more sustainable food system. <br/> Collaboration and fostering a healthy ecosystem for innovations are fundamental for future developments in agritech. According to Justin, coopetition, or the collaboration between competing businesses, which in this case are corporates and startups, will lead to positive outcomes that will reshape the industry. <br/> 'While it is natural for businesses to be wary of new entrants in the market, we believe that many opportunities are there to be realised if traditional players work together with startups,' he pointed out. <br/> Also read: China Mobile International hosts mCloud Carnival 2021[4] <br/> The government continues to play a key role by encouraging startups to hatch innovations in the market. The Malaysian government has created the National Technology &amp; Innovation Sandbox (NTIS)[5] to give space for startups and technology companies to test run their solutions. Khalid mentioned that the sandbox in agritech would bring about insightful case studies that become benchmarks on how the government could form regulations that promote innovations. <br/> 'NTIS ensures that Malaysia doesn't just adopt but create and commercialise solutions using emerging and advanced technologies. It moves products along the technology readiness tranches in an expedient manner, from ideas to invention and implementation \u2014 and onward to commercialisation' he added, emphasising the role of agriculture, food, and water as key socio-economic sectors. <br/> With an agritech industry strengthened by the support of a startup ecosystem whose unique innovations in technology can help yield better and more efficient food production, Malaysia and the rest of the world can look forward to a more bountiful future. <br/> - - <br/> This article is produced by the e27 team, sponsored byMaGIC <br/> We can share your story at e27, too.

Depending on one's age this elicits amusement, anxiety or resignation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Philanthropist Nicole Shanahan refuses to take the facts around menopause and women's reproductive time clock lying down - and women are the better for it. There is, to be sure, little dispute around Reproduction 101, but research into ways to extend women's reproductive capabilities is also far from extensive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We never ask men if they believed they were going infertile at 35. We ask this of women because I think women for so long have been held to a standard of struggle. There is a lot of mental burden around losing any physical ability. But when that ability relates to becoming a parent or having your own children... It is a massive mental burden to tell your daughter as she starts to learn about herself in her teens, as she decides what she wants to do and dream of for herself. I want to remove that mental burden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm excited. I'm optimistic that within my lifetime, we're going to see the entire notion of menopause flipped on its head.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, Ms Shanahan gifted US$8 million to the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine for research into \"reproductive longevity\", to study ways to push the boundaries of female fertility and health. The effort, said NUS in a statement, aims to find ways to improve and lengthen female reproductive health and longevity, \"potentially enabling women to conceive safely in their later years\". It is not just the ability to conceive that deteriorates with age. Women in menopause also grapple with more health issues including metabolic diseases and osteoporosis. The gift was made through Ms Shanahan's Bia-Echo Foundation, based in the United States.</p><p>Ms Shanahan is married to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who is named by Bloomberg Billionaire Index as the ninth richest person in the world with a net worth of US$86 billion. Mr Brin's family office is setting up a branch in Singapore.</p><p>Ms Shanahan, 35, herself struggled to conceive. At 29 she was told that her body produced immature egg cells, if at all, and that she could be approaching menopause. In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) efforts came to naught. Her story has a happy ending: She and Mr Brin now have a two-and-a-half year old daughter. But for many other women, the journey to conceive is uphill and emotionally wrenching.</p><p>The cause of reproductive longevity has no stronger champion than Ms Shanahan, who reckons she may have coined the term. She brings to the fray not just ample funding, but a doggedness and resilience honed from her hardscrabble roots. Today she lacks for nothing, but she grew up in a poor, single-parent household. She put herself through law school through student loans, where she specialised in intellectual property and high technology.</p><p>Her mother migrated to the US from China in her 20s and spoke no English when she arrived.</p><p>\"It was very hard watching her navigate life. My brother and I were born only a few years after she got to the US. She didn't get a chance to go to college until we were teenagers. She didn't really have access to regular work; she held little jobs here and there...</p><p>\"I'm so proud of how she really instilled in me the work ethic, that work pays off if you just keep going and don't give up. Just trust the system of hard work and merit.\" Her younger brother is a professional snowboard instructor. \"He and I are very fortunate that we both got to follow our dreams.\"</p><p>Her passion for the legal issues around intellectual property was sparked at age 12, when she experienced an epiphany of sorts about the value of human ideas.</p><p>\"We had these really cheesy TV commercials for 1800-PATENTS or something. I remember thinking to myself - wait, every second, every idea must surely have been discovered... As a kid in California in the 1990s you literally saw innovation happening every single day through the Internet. At that time dial-up Internet was incredibly slow and inefficient. But it really stimulated me to think about human invention in a completely different context. No one in my family had ever been to law school, but I just couldn't think of anything better to do or more inspiring than intellectual property law.</p><p>\"It was the concept that humans generate ideas that can be protected as their own entity, and those ideas are basically the foundation for economic development and human evolution, and collaboration. So I begged my way into an internship. I sent out hundreds of resumes, and I really had nothing on my resume. One boutique firm said if I interned for no expense, they may hire me as a paralegal.\"</p><p>She was already a patent specialist even before entering law school. She worked on the sale of the Nortel Network portfolio of patents, a challenging and \"nearly impossible\" task of assessing the value of over 4,000 patents. She was in her 20s then and helped to organise the analyses for an opening bid. Her team lost out, but the experience marked a turning point in her fledgling career.</p><p>\"That experience was why I started ClearAccessIP, because every room I ever worked at and every patent firm I interfaced with had very rudimentary processes for understanding, valuing and trading these incredible assets which I had come to respect so deeply. There was a very clear need and opportunity for technology to play a role.</p><p>\"One human being can only read so many patents. How were I and a team of three others going to read 4,000 patents and properly value them? So in part what happened was we undervalued the portfolio, which was why we didn't get it at the time. It was a really big learning experience for me. I don't like to lose but it was really educational to be that wrong.</p><p>\"We were off by almost half a billion dollars in our valuation analysis. I created ClearAccessIP as a way to cut down the cost of getting the most accurate view of the contents of each patent. And it ultimately became one of the most sophisticated NLP (natural language processing) ever created in legal tech.\"</p><p>Founded in 2013, ClearAccessIP helps the creators and owners of intellectual property to develop, manage and transact patent-protected technology. The firm created one of the world's most advanced patent intelligence AI engines, enabling companies to scour for technologies and helping to bridge the information gap for buyers and sellers of intellectual property. Last year ClearAccessIP was sold to IPwe, though Ms Shanahan continues to own shares.</p><p>It was at a gathering at the home of television producer Norman Lear when the idea for further research on reproductive health grabbed hold of her. She was at the event to present her research on longevity, using ClearAccessIP's intellectual property database on aging.</p><p>\"I wasn't particularly passionate about longevity. I was in my 30s when I delivered the project but I didn't really view it as that interesting.\" She did her presentation, sat down and looked at her Flo app which tracks her monthly cycle. \"I was thinking to myself, there goes another ovulation. Maybe I'll have a baby, or maybe not. I was in my early 30s, and I thought - I'm getting old.\" She sat up when Victor Dzau, president of the US National Academy of Medicine, who was also at the gathering, said it was time to \"change the narrative on aging\".</p><p>\"He said - Once we change the narrative we can line up the science to actually tackle it and hit our goals. As those words were coming in, I thought to myself - how come reproductive longevity did not come up in my research? I went up to Marc Hodosh (founder of TEDMED) and asked - Marc, is there a field on longevity for women's reproduction? He said he'd never heard of the term.\"</p><p>She adds: \"I think I'm the first to turn it into a field of medicine that can produce research and receive grants.\"</p><p>In 2018 the Bia-Echo Foundation tied up with the Buck Institute to establish the Centre for Female Reproductive Longevity and Equality. Ms Shanahan says the centre envisions \"organising the field into new categories of science that can translate into, first, new diagnostic tools, and second, new therapies and treatments\".</p><p>\"What we're learning is that it's not one thing that can make a woman infertile from one day to another. There are multiple variables. I think we need to evolve our diagnostic tools beyond a very rudimentary blood test that measures basic hormone expression in the blood. That's pretty much all we have, and a follicle count. In five years, I think we're going to see that these are very basic diagnostics.</p><p>\"Since I started this work, I've gotten hundreds of letters and emails from women telling me their miracle stories. Women share with me that they were perimenopausal or menopausal, and suddenly found themselves pregnant. Or they were told in their 20s that they were going through early menopause, and they came out of it at 46. I think there is science and so much in this field to be explored.</p><p>\"In terms of framing the question we have to look at the various diagnostic tools and basically understand that fertility ebbs and flows in a woman's life. So rather than look at it as a chart, you have to see it as multi-variable, and see how the ebb and flow happen over time.\"</p><p>It was not by chance that she came to consider NUS for a grant. In 2013 she was attached to NUS for a semester to study IP trade and Chinese law. Prior to that, she obtained a degree majoring in Asian Studies with minors in economics and Mandarin.</p><p>\"Even before I dreamed of being a lawyer I wanted to be someone who could connect the East with the West. I had this strong sense of justice and globalisation, maybe because I never fit in with my Caucasian family nor my Chinese family. Or maybe I fit in with both, but I never felt like I was one or the other.</p><p>\"I kept hearing about Singapore, I was fascinated with the country. And it exceeded my wildest imagination of what was possible. I get emotional thinking about it because to me, it is a country that has achieved everything I hoped for, for a meeting of minds of the East and West. It's like you have a country that is so diverse; it's English speaking but has such strong roots to Chinese culture.</p><p>\"Chinese culture is even more relevant in my life because it's so uniquely cohesive from country to country. It's very strong in the Bay area. And seeing it in a country where you see the result of the coming together of so many cultures - that's my hope for my family and my daughter.\"</p><p>Bia-Echo Foundation has two other causes: criminal justice reform in the US and raising consciousness towards a \"healthy and livable planet\".</p><p>On criminal justice reform, she says: \"My focus is always on understanding where the points of deep injustice lie and trying to meet at those points.

If done well, it could be a win for the fight against climate change and curb the loss of nature.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; To get there, the market must overcome questions about transparency and concerns over ensuring every project does what it claims: reduces or locks away CO2 in a fully verifiable way.</p><p> And investors also need reassurance that the conservation or replanting projects are fully protected and not destroyed by fire or cleared for agriculture or logging. That's where technology such as satellite monitoring comes in.</p><p> While existing projects have proved the model, the concern is whether vastly scaled-up investment will undermine the integrity of the market in the rush for carbon gold.</p><p> Carbon credits represent a tonne of CO2 reduced or locked away. It's an attractive idea for customers such as car manufacturers, tech firms, banks and pension funds keen to hedge their future carbon costs.</p><p> A key focus, particularly in South-east Asia, is on saving natural ecosystems rich in carbon and with a high capacity for soaking up CO2, such as peat swamp forests. These forests and replanted areas need to be protected over the long term from logging, illegal clearing for palm oil and fires. Which is why well-run projects hire staff to monitor the project area on the ground, and in space using satellites.</p><p> Ultimately, the idea is about putting a value on ecosystems, a value that helps them compete with mining, industrial agriculture and logging interests.</p><p> The higher the carbon price, the greater the return - and the incentive for investors to take the risk.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;THE SINGAPORE CONNECTION&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; \"Thanks to their rich forest, wetland and mangrove ecosystems, South-east Asia and Asia generally are set to become one of the largest suppliers of natural climate solutions (NCS) globally. The region houses a third of the cost-effective NCS supply potential from both the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and India,\" said Mr Mikkel Larsen, chief sustainability officer for DBS Bank.</p><p> That makes Singapore a natural centre for investing in these projects and trading the credits - this explains why Temasek, DBS and others are looking at ways for Singapore to capitalise on revamping the market.</p><p> The idea is to leverage Singapore's long history in commodities trading and its well-regulated financial market. Singapore firms could use offsets as part of their emissions reduction strategies and, one day, carbon credits might be included in the nation's carbon tax scheme.</p><p> Temasek has been helping to guide Singapore's evolution into a carbon services hub and has bought offsets from two forest carbon projects to meet its internal emissions targets.</p><p> A Temasek spokesman said multiple approaches should be used in the fight against climate change, including carbon offsets. He added that Temasek hopes to support natural climate solutions and carbon projects that are of high quality and meet other social and environmental aspects, such as conserving and restoring important ecological systems like peatlands, rainforests and mangroves.</p><p> Preserving and rehabilitating these areas also reduce the risk of fires and haze, and are good for local communities.</p><p> Investor interest is being driven by mounting pressure on companies and governments to meet stringent climate targets. Globally there's been a surge in pledges to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. To get there, you're going to need nature.</p><p> \"Eliminating the 51 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere every year requires an enormous amount of global momentum and investment,\" said Mr Dharsono Hartono, co-founder of the Katingan-Mentaya forest preservation project in Central Kalimantan on Borneo island.</p><p> \"This is going to involve entirely rethinking how we produce energy, how we travel and how societies operate. But it also means rethinking how we treat nature. To keep global warming well below 2 deg C, we must protect nature,\" he added.</p><p> The Katingan-Mentaya project, comprising mostly carbon-rich deep peat swamp forest, is about twice the area of Singapore. Saving it from destruction by palm oil companies means about 7.5 million tonnes of CO2 are prevented from being emitted every year. Selling carbon offsets to big corporations, including VW Group, Shell and Bank of America, helps run the project and fund community programmes.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;TRUE POTENTIAL&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; Mr Dharsono's project, though, represents a fraction of the true potential if huge investment is channelled into well-managed and well-funded projects.</p><p> South Pole, a Swiss firm that has developed more than 800 carbon offset projects globally, sees big opportunities for investment.</p><p> \"Nature-based solutions - such as forest protection and restoration - can actually provide over a third of the climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to stabilise warming to below 2 deg C very cost-effectively. So investing in a cost-effective solution that can mitigate over 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions seems like a no-brainer,\" said Ms Leah Wieczorek, South Pole's business development lead for Asia, who is based in Singapore.</p><p> Under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, nearly 200 nations agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 deg C and aim for 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels if possible.</p><p> Professor Koh Lian Pin runs the Centre for Nature-Based Climate Solutions at the National University of Singapore. He and his team have analysed areas of the planet that could yield good returns for investors.</p><p> In a recent study published in Nature Communications, Prof Koh and colleagues show that at an initial carbon price of US$5.80 (S$7.70) a tonne, the protection of tropical forests can generate investible carbon amounting to 1.8 billion tonnes a year globally - roughly the annual emissions of Japan and Australia combined.</p><p> Financially viable carbon projects could generate return-on-investment totalling US$46 billion a year, with the highest returns in the Asia-Pacific at US$24.6 billion, followed by the Americas and Africa.</p><p> And the higher the carbon price, the greater the area of forest carbon sites that could be conserved.</p><p> The recent surge in interest in carbon offsets is pointing to higher prices, especially buyers locking in future flows of offsets at higher prices for high-quality projects.</p><p> Groups such as former Bank of England governor Mark Carney's task force on scaling up the voluntary carbon market foresee exponential growth over the coming decade.</p><p> \"In 2019, just over US$300 million worth of trading took place on the voluntary market when these projects should be measured in the tens of billions of dollars per year,\" he told a green finance summit in London last November.</p><p> Investors such as HSBC and Australia's Pollination group, a climate change advisory firm, agree.</p><p> Last year, both teamed up with the aim of creating the world's largest dedicated natural capital asset management company. They are launching a natural capital fund to invest primarily in regenerative agriculture and sustainable forestry projects. A second carbon fund is also planned aiming to ramp up investment in carbon offset projects. Overall, the intention is to raise up to US$6 billion in funds.</p><p> \"We take the view that there is a huge amount of demand and very little supply such that investment is required in the underlying projects to scale them up rapidly,\" said Mr Martijn Wilder, Pollination's founding partner.</p><p> The funding model for nature-based projects has to change, he said, with significant upfront funding crucial to ensure projects get off the ground, are well managed and well protected.</p><p> \"Protecting a rainforest is an infrastructure project. That's what you're doing.\"</p><p> HSBC said escalating risks to the climate and biodiversity have changed mindsets.\"Today, nature is undervalued and overlooked by our investment community. This must change,\" said Ms Melissa McDonald, the bank's global head of responsible investment.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;HOW TO SCALE UP&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; The existing voluntary carbon market has been around for about two decades and has strict standards for offset projects. But trading has always been small and opaque because it's purely between buyer and seller and not on an open exchange. That needs to change, market players said.</p><p> The main standard-setting body that certifies offset projects, Washington-based Verra, has issued offsets representing 622 million tonnes of CO2 reduced from 1,697 projects to date. That's the equivalent of taking 132 million cars off the road for a year.</p><p> And the market is growing. \"We've seen that in terms of the volumes of the projects coming through the door. That's definitely growing. We've seen in the last few years an increasing trend towards natural climate solutions,\" said Verra CEO David Antonioli.</p><p> South Pole's Ms Wieczorek said interest is growing in Asia, too. \"We are seeing a dramatic increase in clients in Asia looking to make carbon reduction commitments,\" she noted, adding that some clients are looking to lock in long-term offtake contracts.</p><p> \"The vast majority of humankind's carbon emissions are currently unpriced, so having a dedicated budget for offsetting also helps companies set or at least consider an internal price on carbon,\" she added.</p><p> For now, though, Mr Carney, who is the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance, said the voluntary carbon market still struggles with low liquidity and scarce financing.</p><p> To scale things up, Prof Koh said the market must overcome \"pain points\". \"The market will grow with our ability to improve the quality of those nature-based credits, our ability to reduce the cost of validation, of certification, to improve the transparency of monitoring those projects.\"</p><p> Mr Larsen of DBS agrees.</p><p> \"The thing that has plagued the voluntary carbon market for the longest time is issues around trust and integrity. The quality and integrity of the projects is believed to be too low,\" he said. People buy a project and it doesn't do what it is said to do, that's the integrity. Or it creates problems and social issues, that's the quality, he said.</p><p> \"There's no doubt that carbon offsets projects, if done right, do work, and they do sequester carbon,\" he said. But he also feels that transparency around pricing and verification is needed. Technology can help by improving the science and technology around projects, around verification of carbon stock, for example finding ways of improving carbon sequestration.</p><p> One firm that has brought price transparency is Singapore-based AirCarbon Exchange, a digital platform that trades fully verified carbon offsets. The exchange treats carbon offsets like a commodity with a range of offsets available for trading.</p><p> \"The current market construct fails to send a strong price signal due to a fragmented project-based trading environment. A strong price signal will unleash pent-up capital to finance climate mitigating projects,\" said Mr Bill Pazos, AirCarbon's chief operating officer and co-founder.</p><p> Few in the market question the integrity of the standards set by Verra - it's more that the problems lie elsewhere in the market as it has evolved. \"These standards have been around for 15 to 20 years. They are very robust. They are constantly evolving and improving themselves,\" said Pollination's Mr Wilder.</p><p> Verra's Mr Antonioli said they are constantly updating their standards according to changes in technology, regulations and latest scientific evidence.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;GENUINE ACTION'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; Some conservation groups say offsets are just a dodge, allowing polluters to buy their way out of making deep emission cuts to their operations.</p><p> That is untrue, key players said.</p><p> \"It is impossible right now for most companies to achieve climate neutrality, a key milestone on the journey to meet net-zero pledges, without the use of carbon credits,\" said South Pole's Ms Wieczorek.</p><p> Offsets from well-run, fully verified projects can help firms that are already cutting emissions go the last mile.</p><p> For DBS' Mr Larsen, carbon credits are responding to an urgent need. \"We talk about carbon offsets as a potential point of delay and inaction. And I always really struggle with that because with a football field of rainforest being cut down every six seconds, the inaction lies in not trying to help.\"</p><p> Mr Wilder said that for now, carbon financing remains a vital source of funding for conservation, despite the detractors. \"The global climate is in crisis and we have to do everything we possibly can to reduce the risks.

Which is why well-run projects hire staff to monitor the project area on the ground, and in space using satellites.</p><p> Ultimately, the idea is about putting a value on ecosystems, a value that helps them compete with mining, industrial agriculture and logging interests.</p><p> The higher the carbon price, the greater the return - and the incentive for investors to take the risk.</p><p> THE SINGAPORE CONNECTION \"Thanks to their rich forest, wetland and mangrove ecosystems, South-east Asia and Asia generally are set to become one of the largest suppliers of natural climate solutions (NCS) globally. The region houses a third of the cost-effective NCS supply potential from both the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and India,\" said Mr Mikkel Larsen, chief sustainability officer for DBS Bank.</p><p> That makes Singapore a natural centre for investing in these projects and trading the credits - this explains why Temasek, DBS and others are looking at ways for Singapore to capitalise on revamping the market.</p><p> The idea is to leverage Singapore's long history in commodities trading and its well-regulated financial market. Singapore firms could use offsets as part of their emissions reduction strategies and, one day, carbon credits might be included in the nation's carbon tax scheme.</p><p> Temasek has been helping to guide Singapore's evolution into a carbon services hub and has bought offsets from two forest carbon projects to meet its internal emissions targets.</p><p> A Temasek spokesman said multiple approaches should be used in the fight against climate change, including carbon offsets. He added that Temasek hopes to support natural climate solutions and carbon projects that are of high quality and meet other social and environmental aspects, such as conserving and restoring important ecological systems like peatlands, rainforests and mangroves.</p><p> Preserving and rehabilitating these areas also reduce the risk of fires and haze, and are good for local communities.</p><p> Investor interest is being driven by mounting pressure on companies and governments to meet stringent climate targets. Globally there's been a surge in pledges to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. To get there, you're going to need nature.</p><p> \"Eliminating the 51 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere every year requires an enormous amount of global momentum and investment,\" said Mr Dharsono Hartono, co-founder of the Katingan-Mentaya forest preservation project in Central Kalimantan on Borneo island.</p><p> \"This is going to involve entirely rethinking how we produce energy, how we travel and how societies operate. But it also means rethinking how we treat nature. To keep global warming well below 2 deg C, we must protect nature,\" he added.</p><p> The Katingan-Mentaya project, comprising mostly carbon-rich deep peat swamp forest, is about twice the area of Singapore. Saving it from destruction by palm oil companies means about 7.5 million tonnes of CO2 are prevented from being emitted every year. Selling carbon offsets to big corporations, including VW Group, Shell and Bank of America, helps run the project and fund community programmes.</p><p> TRUE POTENTIAL Mr Dharsono's project, though, represents a fraction of the true potential if huge investment is channelled into well-managed and well-funded projects.</p><p> South Pole, a Swiss firm that has developed more than 800 carbon offset projects globally, sees big opportunities for investment.</p><p> \"Nature-based solutions - such as forest protection and restoration - can actually provide over a third of the climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to stabilise warming to below 2 deg C very cost-effectively. So investing in a cost-effective solution that can mitigate over 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions seems like a no-brainer,\" said Ms Leah Wieczorek, South Pole's business development lead for Asia, who is based in Singapore.</p><p> Under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, nearly 200 nations agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 deg C and aim for 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels if possible.</p><p> Professor Koh Lian Pin runs the Centre for Nature-Based Climate Solutions at the National University of Singapore. He and his team have analysed areas of the planet that could yield good returns for investors.</p><p> In a recent study published in Nature Communications, Prof Koh and colleagues show that at an initial carbon price of US$5.80 (S$7.70) a tonne, the protection of tropical forests can generate investible carbon amounting to 1.8 billion tonnes a year globally - roughly the annual emissions of Japan and Australia combined.</p><p> Financially viable carbon projects could generate return-on-investment totalling US$46 billion a year, with the highest returns in the Asia-Pacific at US$24.6 billion, followed by the Americas and Africa.</p><p> And the higher the carbon price, the greater the area of forest carbon sites that could be conserved.</p><p> The recent surge in interest in carbon offsets is pointing to higher prices, especially buyers locking in future flows of offsets at higher prices for high-quality projects.</p><p> Groups such as former Bank of England governor Mark Carney's task force on scaling up the voluntary carbon market foresee exponential growth over the coming decade.</p><p> \"In 2019, just over US$300 million worth of trading took place on the voluntary market when these projects should be measured in the tens of billions of dollars per year,\" he told a green finance summit in London last November.</p><p> Investors such as HSBC and Australia's Pollination group, a climate change advisory firm, agree.</p><p> Last year, both teamed up with the aim of creating the world's largest dedicated natural capital asset management company. They are launching a natural capital fund to invest primarily in regenerative agriculture and sustainable forestry projects. A second carbon fund is also planned aiming to ramp up investment in carbon offset projects. Overall, the intention is to raise up to US$6 billion in funds.</p><p> \"We take the view that there is a huge amount of demand and very little supply such that investment is required in the underlying projects to scale them up rapidly,\" said Mr Martijn Wilder, Pollination's founding partner.</p><p> The funding model for nature-based projects has to change, he said, with significant upfront funding crucial to ensure projects get off the ground, are well managed and well protected.</p><p> \"Protecting a rainforest is an infrastructure project. That's what you're doing.\"</p><p> HSBC said escalating risks to the climate and biodiversity have changed mindsets.\"Today, nature is undervalued and overlooked by our investment community. This must change,\" said Ms Melissa McDonald, the bank's global head of responsible investment.</p><p> HOW TO SCALE UP The existing voluntary carbon market has been around for about two decades and has strict standards for offset projects. But trading has always been small and opaque because it's purely between buyer and seller and not on an open exchange. That needs to change, market players said.</p><p> The main standard-setting body that certifies offset projects, Washington-based Verra, has issued offsets representing 622 million tonnes of CO2 reduced from 1,697 projects to date. That's the equivalent of taking 132 million cars off the road for a year.</p><p> And the market is growing. \"We've seen that in terms of the volumes of the projects coming through the door. That's definitely growing. We've seen in the last few years an increasing trend towards natural climate solutions,\" said Verra CEO David Antonioli.</p><p> South Pole's Ms Wieczorek said interest is growing in Asia, too. \"We are seeing a dramatic increase in clients in Asia looking to make carbon reduction commitments,\" she noted, adding that some clients are looking to lock in long-term offtake contracts.</p><p> \"The vast majority of humankind's carbon emissions are currently unpriced, so having a dedicated budget for offsetting also helps companies set or at least consider an internal price on carbon,\" she added.</p><p> For now, though, Mr Carney, who is the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance, said the voluntary carbon market still struggles with low liquidity and scarce financing.</p><p> To scale things up, Prof Koh said the market must overcome \"pain points\". \"The market will grow with our ability to improve the quality of those nature-based credits, our ability to reduce the cost of validation, of certification, to improve the transparency of monitoring those projects.\"</p><p> Mr Larsen of DBS agrees.</p><p> \"The thing that has plagued the voluntary carbon market for the longest time is issues around trust and integrity. The quality and integrity of the projects is believed to be too low,\" he said. People buy a project and it doesn't do what it is said to do, that's the integrity. Or it creates problems and social issues, that's the quality, he said.</p><p> \"There's no doubt that carbon offsets projects, if done right, do work, and they do sequester carbon,\" he said. But he also feels that transparency around pricing and verification is needed. Technology can help by improving the science and technology around projects, around verification of carbon stock, for example finding ways of improving carbon sequestration.</p><p> One firm that has brought price transparency is Singapore-based AirCarbon Exchange, a digital platform that trades fully verified carbon offsets. The exchange treats carbon offsets like a commodity with a range of offsets available for trading.</p><p> \"The current market construct fails to send a strong price signal due to a fragmented project-based trading environment. A strong price signal will unleash pent-up capital to finance climate mitigating projects,\" said Mr Bill Pazos, AirCarbon's chief operating officer and co-founder.</p><p> Few in the market question the integrity of the standards set by Verra - it's more that the problems lie elsewhere in the market as it has evolved. \"These standards have been around for 15 to 20 years. They are very robust. They are constantly evolving and improving themselves,\" said Pollination's Mr Wilder.</p><p> Verra's Mr Antonioli said they are constantly updating their standards according to changes in technology, regulations and latest scientific evidence.</p><p> GENUINE ACTION? Some conservation groups say offsets are just a dodge, allowing polluters to buy their way out of making deep emission cuts to their operations.</p><p> That is untrue, key players said.</p><p> \"It is impossible right now for most companies to achieve climate neutrality, a key milestone on the journey to meet net-zero pledges, without the use of carbon credits,\" said South Pole's Ms Wieczorek.</p><p> Offsets from well-run, fully verified projects can help firms that are already cutting emissions go the last mile.</p><p> For DBS' Mr Larsen, carbon credits are responding to an urgent need. \"We talk about carbon offsets as a potential point of delay and inaction. And I always really struggle with that because with a football field of rainforest being cut down every six seconds, the inaction lies in not trying to help.\"</p><p> Mr Wilder said that for now, carbon financing remains a vital source of funding for conservation, despite the detractors. \"The global climate is in crisis and we have to do everything we possibly can to reduce the risks. We shouldn't be ideological about offsets and how we do it, provided the actions are real and have integrity.\"</p><p>TOMORROW \u00b7A look at two Indonesian forest carbon projects</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Investors such as HSBC and Australia's Pollination group, a climate change advisory firm, agree.

This is captured in the film, which has won awards at several film festivals.</p><p> Its director is one-half of the couple, John Chester, a 48-year-old film-maker and television director.
