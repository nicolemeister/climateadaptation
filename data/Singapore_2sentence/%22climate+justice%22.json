What happens if they don't'</p><p> Mixed recordICJ opinions have a mixed record of success. </p><p> Some past decisions have been ignored and the court itself cannot punish states that fail to abide by its rulings. </p><p> Its key role is to settle disputes between countries and clarify international law as it applies to nation states. </p><p> The court's opinions carry immense moral weight and clearly set out how existing laws can and should be applied. </p><p> But it cannot enforce this.</p><p> In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to \"immediately suspend\" military operations in Ukraine. </p><p> In response, Russia set out its opposition to the ruling and said the court lacks jurisdiction in the case. </p><p> The war has ground on with Russia defiant against all sanctions and international condemnation.</p><p> In 2013, the court ruled that Cambodia has sovereignty over the whole territory of the Preah Vihear temple, and that Thailand is obligated to withdraw its military personnel from the area. </p><p> But that ruling has failed to end border tensions and deadly clashes between Cambodia and Thailand have flared again in July 2025. </p><p> In 2008, the court rendered a judgment that Singapore has legal title to Pedra Branca island and Malaysia has legal title to Middle Rocks. </p><p> In 2010, the ICJ helped end a dispute between Argentina and Uruguay over a long-running row over a pulp mill on the banks of their shared river.</p><p> In 2019, the court affirmed that the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which had been occupied by Britain for more than 50 years, should be returned to Mauritius. </p><p> In 2024, Britain and Mauritius reached an agreement to cede the archipelago, except for a vital military base, to Mauritius. </p><p> Now comes the hard partSo, what will be the impact of the July 23 climate ruling'</p><p> Well, it is not going to immediately halt US President Donald Trump's \"drill, baby drill\" plans to ramp up oil and gas production, nor bring a swift end to multibillion-dollar oil and gas expansion projects around the globe. </p><p> Mr Trump, like some other world figures, has little regard for international law or the ICJ -- national laws come first. </p><p> What the ICJ has done has set a clear legal path for all countries and lays out the possible consequences of causing environmental climate harms for current and future generations. </p><p> Now comes the hard part -- putting the ruling into action. </p><p> \"The ICJ's rulings are immensely influential and serve as authoritative pronouncements of international law and states' obligations under international law,\" Ms Elizabeth Wu, a transnational governance lawyer based in Singapore, told The Straits Times.</p><p> Governments must now translate their international law obligations articulated by the ICJ into domestic rules and policies and with increased regulatory enforcement. </p><p> \"The private sector should be fully prepared for changing regulations and legal risk. Corporations must ensure that they remain relevant and competitive by getting ahead of the regulatory direction of travel,\" she added. This would include business and human rights-related risks.</p><p> All this will take time. The courts are likely to be key drivers of long-term change, with the opinion expected to boost the success of climate cases against governments and companies. </p><p> COP30A more immediate test of the advisory opinion will be November's COP30 UN climate talks in Brazil.</p><p> \"This opinion should reset the negotiating table going into COP30, making clear that the starting point for the talks is not where politicians landed last year, but where the law requires them to be,\" Ms Nikki Reisch, director of the climate and energy programme at the Center for International Environmental Law, told ST. </p><p> The court's 15 judges made clear that states' climate plans, called nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, must be of the highest ambition and aimed to limit warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key limit backed by scientific research. </p><p> Many nations have yet to submit their updated climate plans to the UN this year and the ICJ opinion could lead some governments to rethink, and possibly strengthen, them ahead of COP30. </p><p> \"The ICJ ruling reflects the demand for climate justice. The 1.5 deg C temperature threshold is a legal obligation, and the fossil fuel industry and particularly petrostates cannot continue to argue that staying within 1.5 deg C is optional,\" said Ms Vesga Correa.</p><p> Intense interestWhat makes this ICJ opinion a bit different is the sheer level of interest and support from nations. </p><p> The Pacific island state of Vanuatu, a nation acutely affected by climate-linked disasters, championed a student-led effort to place questions of states' climate obligations before the ICJ. </p><p> In 2023, the UN General Assembly unanimously supported a resolution for the ICJ to consider states' obligations. </p><p> The court's public hearings in late 2024 generated huge global interest. A total of 96 states -- including Singapore and the US -- and 11 international organisations presented oral arguments, along with 91 written statements and 62 follow-up comments. </p><p> The unprecedented level of participation is proof the court's opinion matters, said Ms Reisch. </p><p> \"No country voted against the UN General Assembly resolution asking the court for its opinion; even the major petrostates wanted the ICJ to clarify the law,\" she said.</p><p> Despite the interest, can countries still ignore the opinion'</p><p> \"No country is immune to climate impacts and no government is exempt from climate obligations. </p><p> \"Denying the clarity of international law no more shields polluters from responsibility than denying the reality of climate change shields the public from its harms,\" Ms Reisch. </p><p> The fossil fuel industry will face mounting public pressure. </p><p> The court's ruling will likely open up new avenues for people and communities to bring lawsuits against oil and gas companies, said Ms Vesga Correa. </p><p> Lawsuits against fossil fuel companies globally and in Asia will also become more commonplace. The number has already increased sharply in the past decade. </p><p> \"The court also confirms that individuals and groups, including future generations, can bring claims under applicable treaties and human rights instruments, even outside the framework of state responsibility. </p><p> \"This greatly expands potential avenues for climate litigation, both domestically and internationally,\" she said. </p><p> Carbon impunityBig polluters have long refused to take responsibility for the impacts of their emissions or to agree to deep emissions cuts or cough up large sums for climate finance. </p><p> The ICJ's ruling challenges the nation-first doctrine of some countries by affirming that all states have the obligation to act with due diligence to prevent significant harm to the climate system, as an obligation of customary international law, said Ms Wu. </p><p> This is regardless whether that state is a party to climate change treaties. \"This narrows the ability for states and corporates to act with impunity,\" she said. </p><p> Ms Reisch said the largest polluters may well contend that the court's opinion does not bind them. \"That's a red herring, because the obligations it lays out do,\" she said. </p><p> The court made clear that the duties to prevent and remedy climate harm are rooted in multiple sources of law.</p><p> This included well-established environmental and human rights law principles and treaties with which all countries must comply -- no matter which way the political winds blow, she added. </p><p> What next'Vanuatu says immediate next steps include tabling a UN resolution that welcomes the opinion and supports its implementation, urging rich nations to ramp up climate finance flows and using the opinion to underpin stronger regional positions. </p><p> \"For Vanuatu, the opinion is both shield and sword: a shield affirming its right to survival and a sword compelling the world's major emitters to act in line with science and justice,\" the government said in a statement after the ruling. </p><p> For the big polluters, the ICJ's ruling means they will face growing pressure on multiple fronts -- in UN climate negotiations, boardrooms, the halls of government and the courts. </p><p> \"It is high time for the age of impunity to end,\" said Ms Reisch.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["In a 133-page advisory opinion, the ICJ made clear that all states -- and the companies they regulate -- have a legal obligation to prevent harms caused by climate change.

And it could lead to a revision of duty-of-care protections by governments. </p><p> Earlier in July, Australia's Federal Court rejected a landmark case brought by Torres Strait Islanders who argued the government had a duty to protect them from climate change impacts.</p><p> The court found the government was not legally obligated to shield the islands from climate change, despite acknowledging the climate threat and the vulnerability of the Torres Strait communities to said threat.</p><p> But, should the islanders appeal, a superior court could revisit the government's obligations in light of the ICJ ruling, legal experts in Australia said on July 24. </p><p> \"No country is exempt from the obligations the court laid out,\" Ms Lennon noted.</p><p> National climate policiesThe ICJ judges also took aim at weak climate policies in a decision that could strengthen the hands of nations calling for stronger climate action at UN climate talks. </p><p> The judges made clear that states' climate plans, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, must be of the highest ambition and aimed to limit warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key limit backed by scientific research.</p><p> Under the Paris pact, nations must submit updated and more ambitious NDCs every five years. In 2025, states must submit NDCs up till 2035. So far, only about 30 states, including Singapore, out of nearly 200, have done so.</p><p> \"Given the assessments of NDCs to date, many states may, in fact, have to update their climate policies and then implement them. The court was clear -- merely having an NDC is not enough,\" said Ms Lennon. </p><p> Moral weightAnalysts say the ICJ opinion, while not legally binding, carries strong moral authority and will inform how national and international courts interpret laws, including those regarding negligence and harm caused to other states.</p><p> It also raises the very real possibility of reparations to poorer nations for climate harms. </p><p> The ICJ made clear that states have to regulate private actors -- companies -- and ensure that their activities are not causing climate damage. </p><p> \"Additionally, the court stated that a breach of these duties could trigger legal consequences, including financial compensation, for example for loss and damage, as well as non-financial reparations and cessation of harm,\" said Ms Lennon. </p><p> The court also confirmed that harm from climate impacts could be established and scientifically attributed to specific polluter states whose acts or omissions resulted in significant harm.</p><p> Climate litigationLegal cases by citizens, rights groups and others targeting companies and governments have grown strongly in recent years. </p><p> At least 226 new climate cases were filed in 2024, bringing the total number of cases filed between 1986 and 2024 to 2,967 across nearly 60 countries, according to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p><p> Most of the cases are in the United States, Europe and Australia, but that is changing, with cases growing in developing nations, including much of Asia. </p><p> The ICJ's strong opinion is likely to increase litigation in international tribunals and forums, said Dr Joana Setzer, Grantham Research Institute's associate professor of climate governance and climate litigation.</p><p> \"The opinion could also shape judicial understandings of climate change, particularly in jurisdictions where international law and norms can influence domestic 'standards of care' in the context of assessing state and non-state actor responsibility to address climate change,\" she told ST.</p><p> And for Asia? </p><p> The opinion gives solid legal ground for vulnerable communities to bring claims not only against states for climate inaction but also against corporations that seek to expand fossil fuel extraction and subsidies, on human rights grounds for irreversible climate harm -- as Ms Nicole Ponce, an environmental and human rights lawyer-advocate from the Philippines with the World's Youth for Climate Justice campaign group, told ST. </p><p> Observers said that for now, governments, companies and lawyers will be closely studying the 133-page opinion for next steps.</p><p> Vanuatuan minister Regenvanu, a key figure in bringing the case before the ICJ, said one quick result could be the strengthening of national climate plans ahead of the UN's upcoming COP30 climate conference in Brazil in November.</p><p> \"We hope to see many more NDCs submitted, and even those that have already been submitted, revised and resubmitted to ensure they are at the standards required by these legal obligations,\" he said. </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["It is the first time the ICJ has addressed states' obligations regarding climate change under existing laws.

While non-binding, previous advisory opinions by the ICJ have led to change. </p><p> This has sparked hope among climate observers that the latest advisory opinion could refocus global attention on the urgency of tackling climate change, especially in the current geopolitical climate, which is not conducive to environmental action. </p><p> \"Amid turmoil in geopolitics and economic uncertainties, the court has reaffirmed the obligation of states to also protect the environment,\" said former Singapore climate negotiator Rueban Manokara, who is now with conservation group World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). </p><p> One example of an ICJ ruling that had a tangible impact is when the court issued an advisory opinion on the Chagos Islands in 2019. The sovereignty of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean had been disputed by Britain and Mauritius, a former British colony. </p><p> The court found that Britain's claims on the islands were wrongful, preventing Mauritius from being fully independent. </p><p> This prompted Britain to enter into negotiations with Mauritius, leading to an agreement in May 2025, when Britain signed a deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, said the Singapore front of the World's Youth for Climate Justice (WYCJ). </p><p> Associate Professor Jolene Lin, director of the NUS Asia-Pacific Centre for Environmental Law, told ST: \"The power of this opinion is that it gives a lot more legal foundation... to (argue) that states owe an obligation to cut emissions, even if they have withdrawn from the Paris Agreement.\"</p><p> What impact could the advisory opinion have  for Singapore'Singapore's contribution to global emissions is small, at about 0.11 per cent. Its historical emissions are low as it is a young country. </p><p> But given its status as a finance and petrochemical hub, Singapore could come under greater scrutiny. </p><p> With the ruling, the ICJ has made it clear that states can be held responsible for pollutive actions of companies, especially those that contribute to fossil fuel production, consumption and financing. </p><p>Singapore has emitted \"significant amounts of greenhouse gases because of our bunkering and industrial activities\", noted Prof Lin. </p><p> She added: \"There can be climate litigation emerging where corporations and financial institutions are being sued for continuing to finance fossil fuel extraction and production.\"</p><p> The WYCJ's Singapore chapter said: \"Singapore may be in breach of its obligations in international law for failing to take adequate measures against emitting companies located here.\" </p><p>Singapore's carbon tax, levied on large emitters here, is one way that the country is trying to curb the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> In 2024, the tax rate rose from $5 per tonne of emissions to $25 per tonne. The rate will go up to $45 a tonne in 2026 and 2027, with a view to reaching between $50 and $80 a tonne by 2030. </p><p> But Mr Sean Tseng, an adjunct senior research fellow at the NUS Faculty of Law, noted that Singapore's carbon price could be more closely scrutinised.</p><p> Mr Tseng said: \"One key question to ask may be: What carbon prices do we need to be consistent with the emission reductions needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement'\" </p><p> The International Monetary Fund recommends a minimum carbon price of US$75 (S$97) for high-income countries. </p><p> How could the advisory opinion affect climate targets set by countries? Countries are given the discretion under the Paris Agreement to determine their own climate change targets and climate policies. </p><p> But with the ICJ ruling, countries may be forced to set more stringent targets for cutting emissions. </p><p> This is because the advisory opinion calls on nations to take more due diligence in laying out the \"highest possible ambition to realising the temperature goals under Paris\", said Mr Tseng. </p><p> \"A reappraisal of current and successive (climate targets) may well be warranted -- not only for Singapore, but for all nations,\" he added.</p><p> In assessing if a country's climate targets are ambitious, a country's level of development, circumstances and historical emissions should be considered, added Mr Manokara, who is global lead of the carbon finance and markets task force at WWF. </p><p> Under the climate pact, countries agreed to strive to limit global warming to \"well below\" 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels. They also agreed to try to limit this warming to 1.5 deg C, to avoid harsher climate impacts. </p><p> Countries must set stronger climate change targets every five years. </p><p> The latest set of climate change targets for 2035 was officially due in February. Only over 20 countries, Singapore included, have submitted them to the UN so far.  </p><p> In its climate ruling, the ICJ said the primary goal should be the 1.5 deg C target, not the 2 deg C one. </p><p> The year 2024 was the first year when global temperatures exceeded 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. While that is one year of data, global warming is forecast to breach the 1.5 deg C Paris limit by the early 2030s, said the UN climate science body. </p><p> But climate scientist Winston Chow from Singapore Management University said that if the world reaches net-zero emissions by 2050, there is still hope of limiting warming to this threshold. </p><p> \"There is still hope to get back down to a liveable world if we get our act together,\" said Professor Chow at the 2025 Bloomberg Sustainable Business Summit on July 30.</p><p> \"Coming up with a new (target) might lead to a more uncertain, confused world, and give the opportunities to people who are for delay and for denial... to muddy the waters and reduce the momentum for any sort of action.\" </p><p> Will the advisory opinion  spur more climate lawsuits  in South-east Asia? The region is highly vulnerable to climate-change impacts, from increasingly powerful typhoons to deadly heatwaves.</p><p> It is possible for countries in South-east Asia to consider bringing accountability lawsuits against developed countries, said NUS' Prof Lin. </p><p> This is because the advisory opinion clearly states that reparations and compensation can be sought, she said. </p><p> Prof Lin noted that there are several ongoing cases in South-east Asia related to air pollution and climate change. </p><p> For example, in 2022, residents of a small island off Jakarta -- at threat of being swallowed up by rising seas -- hauled Swiss cement corporation Holcim to court for its significant contribution to climate change. Holcim is one of Switzerland's largest emitters. </p><p> Pari Island, home to 1,500 people, was partially inundated 10 times in 2023 by exceptionally high tides. </p><p> The residents are demanding Holcim compensate them for climate damage suffered, finance flood-protection measures and commit to deeply cut its emissions. </p><p>NUS Law's Mr Tseng said it will be interesting to see if the landmark opinion leads to climate youth activists pursuing governments for climate inaction, as seen in South Korea and Japan. </p><p> At the same time, South-east Asia is not only a victim of climate change. While the region is not a historical emitter unlike the US, China and Europe, its emissions are rapidly rising.</p><p>WWF's Mr Manokara said: \"As the region develops further, more will be expected from South-east Asian countries to do more for the climate.\" </p><p> He added that the advisory opinion could spur countries in the region to work together on climate change, such as on the Asean power grid -- a regional initiative aiming to have countries trade renewable energy resources -- or on carbon credits. </p><p> Mr Manokara said: \"South-east Asia's forests can (also) be a powerful tool to combat climate change.\"  </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The sovereignty of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean had been disputed by Britain and Mauritius, a former British colony.

No official reason was given, but Ms Villarama's team believes political pressure from China played a role. </p><p> \"It was clear these efforts were not about artistic dialogue,\" Ms Villarama told The Straits Times. \"They were about control. The Chinese government has long used economic pressure to influence institutions into pushing a single narrative. </p><p> \"But here is the thing: We have listened to their stories. We buy their products. We have watched their films and respect their culture. I just hope they have the same courage to listen and to watch ours this time.\"</p><p> Despite the controversy, the Philippine premiere is set for July 27 at a popular shopping mall in Manila. The government's board of censors had rated the film suitable for general viewing with parental guidance since March, days before it was pulled from the local film festival. </p><p> The film made its international debut on June 30 at the Doc Edge Festival in New Zealand, where it screened to positive reviews despite a formal protest from the Chinese Consulate-General in Auckland. Screenings in Wellington and Christchurch have been scheduled for later in July. </p><p> In a letter to festival organisers before the screening, which was later posted online, the Chinese Consulate-General called the film \"rife with disinformation and false propaganda\", and urged the organisers to refrain from screening it, saying it would \"mislead\" the public and harm China-New Zealand relations.</p><p> Doc Edge rejected the request, affirming its commitment to \"independence and curatorial freedom\". Food Delivery won the Tides of Change award, which the festival grants to films that highlight global issues, such as conflict, human rights and climate justice. </p><p> The Straits Times has reached out to the Chinese government for comment. </p><p> The controversy only drew more attention to Food Delivery, which offers rarely seen civilian and military perspectives from the Spratly Islands, a region in the disputed sea claimed by the Philippines, China, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.</p><p> Told through the lens of Filipino troops delivering supplies to remote military outposts and fishermen facing Chinese harassment at sea, the film seeks to humanise an issue often framed in technical or political terms.</p><p> \"It is about so much more than the West Philippine Sea. It is about how food, a basic human need, becomes a language for connection, resistance and care,\" said Ms Villarama. \"And in that way, it becomes something every audience can understand -- Filipino, Chinese or anyone who has ever craved meaning in the middle of chaos.\"</p><p> Despite the global attention, Food Delivery has not secured commercial distribution in the Philippines. No major cinema operator has agreed to screen it as tensions between Manila and Beijing simmer on. </p><p> In general, documentaries rarely reach mainstream cinemas in the country, where commercial chains favour blockbuster fare. Independent film-makers often rely on film festivals, university circuits or grassroots community screenings.</p><p> Ms Villarama's team has embraced this model, coordinating independent screenings with advocacy groups, schools and film collectives. The documentary will be shown again at the same Manila shopping mall in August, with more community screenings planned after that.</p><p> Associate Professor Danilo Arao, who teaches journalism at the University of the Philippines (UP), said China's efforts to block the film reflect both media suppression and diplomatic overreach.</p><p> \"It is not just an issue of media freedom, it is also an issue of overreach on the part of China because they are trying their best to deodorise their image and to control the narrative pertaining to what they claim to be control over the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea. So, it is deplorable that they are doing that,\" he said. </p><p> Dr Arao believes the Philippine government should be more proactive in defending artists and journalists from foreign political pressure.</p><p> Ms Villarama said that since reports of China's intervention in New Zealand, some Philippine officials have quietly reached out to her team.</p><p> \"We are not expecting uniform support from them, especially when geopolitics are involved. But I do hope this film encourages our leaders to defend freedom of expression, and to stand with the people whose lives and labour make that freedom necessary,\" she said.</p><p> Dr Aries Arugay, visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore and chairman of UP's Political Science Department, called China's actions \"undue intrusion into the internal affairs of another country\".</p><p> He said Beijing increasingly uses seemingly benign sectors such as trade, art and cultural exchange as tools of influence.</p><p> \"There are no benign aspects of relationship with China because they can weaponise and use it against the country,\" Dr Arugay told ST.</p><p> He said Food Delivery might not contain direct criticism of China, but its existence contradicts Beijing's tightly managed narrative on the maritime dispute. </p><p> In April, then Senator Francis Tolentino accused the Chinese Embassy in Manila of running a \"hidden and sinister\" disinformation campaign to sway public opinion and discredit critics of Beijing's South China Sea claims. China denied the allegation and has since banned Mr Tolentino from entering the mainland and its territories.</p><p> Dr Arao and Dr Arugay said Food Delivery's visual storytelling is especially powerful in the Philippines, where television and cinema heavily shape public consciousness.</p><p> \"A documentary is potent from a Filipino cultural perspective because we are visual as a people. It will penetrate the public consciousness more, so it is threatening to them (China),\" said Dr Arugay.</p><p> The backlash from Beijing has only strengthened Ms Villarama's conviction that her film's message is more urgent than ever.</p><p> \"The attempts to block the film didn't intimidate us.

ASEAN, China and the GCC all face common pressures for policy reform, governance resilience and regional autonomy in an era of complex global challenges.\u00a0</p><p>                        People inspect the damage at the site of an Israeli strike that targeted a house in the Nuseirat camp for Palestinian refugees in the central Gaza Strip on 1 June 2025.</p><p>                        The joint statement\u2019s expression of concern over the Middle East situation shows an alignment among all three parties over the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in sharp contrast to US President Donald Trump\u2019s avoidance of the issue during his Gulf visit. This alignment reflects not only shared humanitarian values but also a growing confidence among global south actors to speak with a more unified stance on international affairs.\u00a0</p><p>                        Economic complementarity\u00a0</p><p>                        Economically, the summit leverages complementary strengths: ASEAN\u2019s resources and youthful population, China\u2019s industrial capacity and the GCC\u2019s energy wealth and capital. Chinese media and academic commentary describe the summit as laying the groundwork for a \u201ctriangular platform\u201d, a potential new growth driver amid global economic fragmentation. </p><p>                        As Premier Li Qiang noted, \u201cIf we draw a line between China, ASEAN and the GCC, we get a big triangle \u2014 and triangle is the most stable structure.\u201d This metaphor underscores Beijing\u2019s view of the trilateral framework not only as geographically coherent, but also as a structurally resilient basis for long-term cooperation.</p><p>                        As the global economy reels from trade tensions and fragmented supply chains, such partnerships may help buffer shocks. Areas such as clean energy, the digital economy and infrastructure development offer space for practical collaboration. These are areas where real progress is already visible, from Belt and Road infrastructure projects to burgeoning tech investments in the Gulf and Southeast Asia.</p><p>                        Cultural connectivity and soft power</p><p>                        Culturally, the summit highlights the importance of people-to-people exchanges, leveraging ASEAN-GCC Islamic ties and centuries of trade and religious interactions. Premier Li Qiang emphasised the value of mutual learning between civilisations, framing ASEAN, GCC and China as regions rich in historical ties and cultural diversity. These civilisational linkages can underpin new forms of soft power engagement, from tourism promotion, youth collaboration to educational exchange.\u00a0</p><p>                        From China\u2019s perspective, trilateral cooperation offers a complementary, non-exclusive and development-oriented model of multilateral collaboration for global south countries.</p><p>                        China\u2019s Premier Li Qiang attends the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)-China Summit after the 46th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Kuala Lumpur on 27 May 2025.</p><p>                        In a tangible step to support these aspirations, China announced a one-year visa-free policy for four Gulf countries: Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain, effective from 9 June. With the UAE and Qatar already enjoying mutual visa exemption agreements, this move completes China\u2019s visa-free coverage of all GCC member states.</p><p>Malaysia\u2019s proposal for a Confucian-Islamic civilisational dialogue received support from China, signalling Beijing\u2019s interest in positioning itself as a culturally resonant actor in Muslim-majority societies. Yet the impact of such cultural diplomacy remains limited and largely symbolic at this stage.</p><p>                        China\u2019s enthusiasm and the GCC\u2019s ambivalence\u00a0</p><p>                        Nevertheless, China\u2019s high-level attention to the summit reflects its aspiration to shape a model of cooperation and development for global south countries. China has long emphasised its identity as part of the global south. The summit\u2019s narrative fits neatly into Beijing\u2019s broader diplomatic playbook, which includes the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Initiatives, and south-south institutional outreach.\u00a0</p><p>                        From China\u2019s perspective, trilateral cooperation offers a complementary, non-exclusive and development-oriented model of multilateral collaboration for global south countries. This model focuses on comparative advantages of each party, rather than ideological confrontation, and draws on China\u2019s framing of a non-zero-sum global order. China hopes the framework will attract broader participation from global south countries and contribute to a more connected south-south cooperation network.\u00a0</p><p>                        Despite these strategic alignments and aid-based initiatives, tangible outcomes of the GCC\u2019s engagement with the global south have remained limited.\u00a0</p><p>                        A view of the Abu Dhabi skyline on 14 May 2025.</p><p>                        That said, whether this narrative will be genuinely embraced by the Gulf countries remains to be seen. Unlike ASEAN, which is widely recognised as part of the global south due to its postcolonial legacy, developmental status, and active role in south-south cooperation, the GCC countries occupy a more complex position. In classifications by the United Nations, Human Development Reports and the World Bank, they are often listed as \u201chigh-income developing countries\u201d or \u201cnon-OECD high-income countries\u201d, reflecting a hybrid or peripheral global south identity.\u00a0</p><p>                        From a strategic and diplomatic standpoint, however, the GCC states frequently advocate for south-south cooperation and align themselves with developing countries on key issues such as climate justice, decolonisation, and global governance reform. </p><p>                        For instance, the UAE has positioned itself as a strategic partner of the global south through BRICS engagements and climate-related efforts, including the establishment of the \u201closs and damage\u201d fund at COP-28. Qatar has launched public health and education initiatives specifically targeting developing nations, with officials explicitly aligning these programs with \u201cthe priorities of the global south\u201d. Kuwait, too, reaffirmed its commitment to south-south cooperation in a 2022 UN statement, expressing its \u201cconstant readiness to support initiatives that improve the living conditions of the peoples of the south\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>                        Institutional gaps and structural constraints</p><p>                        Despite these strategic alignments and aid-based initiatives, tangible outcomes of the GCC\u2019s engagement with the global south have remained limited. </p><p>                        For example, the GCC-Mercosur Framework Agreement, signed in 2005 to enhance economic cooperation with Latin American countries, has achieved little substantive progress. A study analysing this agreement found that the narrow scope and lack of substantive follow-through have hindered the development of meaningful economic spaces between the GCC and other global south regions. </p><p>                        A similar pattern is evident in GCC\u2013ASEAN relations. Despite multiple ministerial meetings and joint declarations, especially since the early 2000s, no institutional frameworks comparable to ASEAN+3 or ASEAN\u2013EU have been established.\u00a0</p><p>                        China-GCC FTA talks, launched in 2004, have progressed slowly. Although 90% of the terms were reportedly settled by 2024, negotiations have been hampered by geopolitical issues and the GCC\u2019s close ties with the US.</p><p>                        An aircraft flies over the Christ The Redeemer statue at Corcovado hill, as seen from Icarai beach, in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, on 13 May 2025.</p><p>                        Within this \u201cgolden triangle\u201d of the global south, cooperation has followed distinct trajectories shaped by differing priorities and geopolitical realities. In particular, Gulf engagement has been constrained by strategic concerns. </p><p>                        Take free trade negotiations as an example: the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), established in 2010, has seen robust development, with trade reaching $911.7 billion in 2023. The ACFTA 3.0 upgrade, substantively concluded in October 2024, expands cooperation in digital economy, green energy, and supply chains, covering 90% of tariff lines at zero for core ASEAN members. </p><p>                        In contrast, China-GCC FTA talks, launched in 2004, have progressed slowly. Although 90% of the terms were reportedly settled by 2024, negotiations have been hampered by geopolitical issues and the GCC\u2019s close ties with the US. Talks were suspended in 2009 due to China\u2019s protection of its domestic petrochemical industry. Further delays were caused by disagreements over Syria and internal divisions within the GCC. Although negotiations resumed in 2016, a final deal remains elusive after 11 rounds, casting doubt on whether an agreement is truly within reach.</p><p>                        A platform in search of structure</p><p>                        Ultimately, one of the key questions following the summit is whether the trilateral framework can evolve into a more structured mechanism for cooperation. Unlike the more developed China\u2013ASEAN partnership or the China\u2013GCC strategic dialogue, this trilateral platform is still in its early stages. Without regular follow-up meetings, working groups, or investment coordination mechanisms, its full potential remains to be realised.

These include the designation of a marine park, the OneMillionTrees planting initiative, and other efforts to help wildlife species, including the once-extinct otters and hornbills, thrive. </p><p> However, care needs to be taken to ensure natural ecosystems are looked after even as the country continues to develop, Ms Puentes Riano said. </p><p> Citing the example of the future Long Island project, which involves reclaiming land at higher levels off East Coast and placing them in the form of islands to protect the coastline from sea-level rise, Ms Puentes Riano said: \"It is of great importance to prevent and minimise impacts of ecosystems including in the face of new and upcoming projects such as the Long Island project.</p><p> \"Impacts on the marine ecosystems need to be adequately assessed and prevented, as damage to ecosystems can be irreversible,\" she added. </p><p>Singapore can also ensure that its development does not come at the expense of nature loss elsewhere.</p><p> Reclamation projects need to be accountable for the impacts on the source countries that land materials come from, and developers should prevent and reduce reclamation's impact on the Republic and abroad, Ms Puentes Riano stressed. </p><p> She added that findings from all environmental impact assessments (EIAs) should be publicly available, and this, alongside public engagements, should be coded into law. </p><p>Singapore has guidelines about when an EIA should be done, such as if proposed developments are close to sensitive nature areas, but has no EIA law. </p><p> She added: \"One of the gaps here is that there is a lack of clarity about when EIAs are done, when (they are) published, what is published.

It charts a clearer path for entrepreneurs looking to solve the urgent issue of the plastic pollution crisis[1]. <br/>The need for this is clear in Southeast Asia, where the abundantly visible plastic pollution crisis has already inspired hundreds of entrepreneurs to collect, sort, and innovate plastics at every stage of the manufacturing process, from waste pickers (\u200b\u200bthe people who derive an income for picking material from waste streams) to researchers and startup founders. <br/>A clear(er) opportunity for our entrepreneurs <br/>The exciting opportunity of the Global Plastics Treaty lies in clarifying and unifying a fragmented policy landscape. <br/>By now, news about the plastics pollution crisis is no longer surprising, nor are the attempts to solve it. Where nations have lacked waste management infrastructure, informal waste pickers have collected, sorted, and managed plastic waste for decades.  <br/>In fact, they are responsible for 97 per cent of PET bottles[2] collected for recycling, a formal part of the waste management system, which means they often don't receive social and economic protections. <br/>Each nation has different goals, metrics and approaches to tackle the plastics pollution crisis. Not to mention how regional initiatives (such as the ASEAN regional action plan for combating marine debris[3]) often sit separately too.  <br/>The Global Plastics Treaty has the opportunity to create a single framework and reporting system for all stakeholders to align with. This will greatly benefit entrepreneurs, as a clearly defined problem to solve makes for a better target for innovation. <br/>Across Southeast Asia, entrepreneurial individuals are already applying themselves to the plastics pollution crisis. <br/>Also Read: Why interest in cleantech lags and how startups can overcome[4] <br/>For example, Vietnam-based ReForm Plastic currently empowers over 20 informal waste workers while operating six decentralised factories across Southeast Asia via a social franchise model with over 100 tons of non-tradable plastic waste processed in 2021. <br/>The startup currently empowers 10 informal waste workers while operating four factories across Southeast Asia, with 85 tons of plastic waste diverted in 2021. <br/>ReForm Plastic <br/>With a global treaty that clearly outlines the steps toward tackling plastic pollution, the markets for solutions to these issues become a lot clearer.  <br/>In turn, this de-risks the innovation opportunity for entrepreneurs. Starting your venture involves an element of luck but creating one that meets a clearly defined problem with legally-binding goals makes it an opportunity that is both more secure and stable to explore.  <br/>When we de-risk innovation, we open the doors wider for a more diverse range of entrepreneurs to enter the market. <br/>Enabling more sustainable livelihoods <br/>Plastic pollution disproportionately impacts the poor and the marginalised. Innovating today is not just important but urgent. <br/>Limited choices and incomes restrict households to rely on single-use plastic packaging, while underdeveloped infrastructure can leave communities drowning in plastic waste.  <br/>Yet these communities are not simply victims of plastic pollution; they had played a critical role in tackling this crisis before the treaty was even on the table. <br/>It's exciting to see that stakeholders across the plastic value chain are not just advocating for the voices of some of these unheard voices. The efforts of waste workers and the informal sector were explicitly named in the treaty, so we hope their interests and voices will be represented in the final agreement. <br/>Also Read: Why corporates and investors must climb the mountain called sustainability[5] <br/>These perspectives, and expertise, are critical to ensure solutions meet the needs of affected communities, and innovations will be built with, not enforced on, those on the frontlines. <br/>While anyone can innovate, not everyone has the resources. When entrepreneurs face fewer risks or resistance, they're more likely to start pursuing their innovation - and succeed. <br/>At The Incubation Network[6], we have the privilege of supporting an incredible number of entrepreneurs innovating for the better on a daily basis.  <br/>One fantastic example in Indonesia is Reciki Solusi which has launched a new project to improve the livelihoods of women waste workers and the impact of waste banks by establishing a buy-back centre for rigid plastic.  <br/>Women at their centre will have the opportunity to be formally employed, be enrolled in the national social security and health insurance program, and be given opportunities to upskill. <br/>A compass, not a map <br/>The foundations of the treaty have made one direction clear: the entire plastics value chain, from source to sea, needs to be revisited. If we want to reimagine the whole lifecycle of plastics, we need to take a holistic approach and come up with circular solutions. <br/>The circular economy promotes closed-loop production, think reduce, reuse, recycle. Instead of a cycle of extraction and waste, we follow a cycle of sustainable resource usage. <br/>Tackling such a visible and prominent problem like the plastics pollution crisis could help carve a path for other industries to consider a circular economy approach.  <br/>While the finer details and deliverables of the Global Plastics Treaty are being discussed, entrepreneurs have a clear remit to tackle the plastic pollution crisis. Those who move ahead of the treaty's legally binding requirements stand to gain from a first-mover advantage once it is finalised.  <br/>The details may not be clear, but the sentiment is: there are opportunities for innovators at every stage of the plastics value chain and space for new players to emerge. <br/>There is already a growing swell of energy and interest in the opportunities that a circular approach to plastics and waste could offer.  <br/>In the last two and a half years alone, The Incubation Network has worked with upwards of 200 solutions looking to do just that and will continue to build on the ecosystem's momentum to further progress. <br/>Policies can be an important innovation catalyst. The Global Plastics Treaty presents an opportunity to put an overdue target on our region's plastic pollution crisis. Bringing attention to the entrepreneurial gap is critical to inviting more stakeholders and startups into this space. <br/>- <br/>Editor's note:e27aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.

The city-state - regarded as a trusted broker in the COP28 negotiations - lies \"at the vanguard of climate research\", and is a major player in climate finance. Yet, a key issue that has preoccupied Singapore is energy transition. As a \"renewable-energy disadvantaged\" nation, it ultimately has to rely on imports to meet its decarbonisation goals.On this score, the past year has been productive. Singapore has unveiled plans to import wind-powered renewable energy from Vietnam and also rapidly secured deals with Cambodia and Indonesia. </p><p>These moves allow Singapore to hit, and potentially even surpass, its target of having 30 per cent of its electricity demand supplied by \"low-carbon\" imported sources by 2035. Collaboration with fellow Asean member states is the more welcome given that every bilateral renewable energy trading link is a step towards the establishment of the elusive Asean Power Grid, a power-sharing arrangement in the region. It would build off the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, which proves the feasibility of bringing renewable energy across multiple borders.Some challenges remain but, overall, the Singapore government's mission and drive on this front are more than evident. Water and oil analogiesThe ability to hit its own domestic targets provides the platform for Singapore to look towards a bigger ambition: going beyond decarbonisation and energy security, and reconfiguring itself as a renewable energy hub.The historical analogy often drawn by commentators and policymakers for Singapore's efforts to decarbonise its energy mix has been its proud \"water story\", which is perhaps a misleading comparison. The \"water story\", in brief, is a narrative about how resource-poor Singapore managed to overcome its dependence on imported water by leveraging developing technologies and a collective determination to achieve water self-sufficiency.It might be more appropriate to think of Singapore replicating its history as an oil-trading state. While it produces no oil, it has had an essential role in global oil trade, by leveraging its strategic location at the southern tip of the Strait of Malacca and providing high-quality services in bunkering, oil pricing and associated services. Singapore's \"oil story\" is no less important than its \"water story\". Playing a middleman role in distributing and re-exporting oil and petroleum-derived products has allowed Singapore to achieve several strategic objectives all at once. First, it has ensured a steady supply of oil for domestic use. Second, by playing a key role in the circulation of global commodities, it has established the Republic's relevance in the global political economy, a deeply entrenched foreign policy aim. And third, it has laid the foundation for a significant maritime industry, which contributes to its economic growth.Singapore is seeking to replicate the strategy and recast itself as a renewable energy hub. By leveraging its strategic location and advanced infrastructure, Singapore can position itself as the distribution point to serve markets around South-east Asia and potentially beyond. This would yield major strategic benefits, as outlined above. But it would require overcoming several obstacles.Challenges to renewable energy hub aspirationsOne of the more tricky challenges is having to navigate any links between renewable energy and energy nationalism. A big part of the draw of renewable energy is its ability to produce energy self-sufficiency. Global trends and events, especially the war in Ukraine, has alerted countries to the fragility of energy supply chains. This has led to growing attention on and investments into renewable energy. As the International Renewable Energy Agency states, \"Renewable energy resources are available in one form or another in most countries, unlike fossil fuels which are concentrated in specific geographic locations. This reduces the importance of current energy choke points, such as the narrow channels on widely used sea routes that are critical to the global supply of oil.\" Unfortunately, Singapore is an exception though - unpropitious geographical circumstances mean that it cannot produce sufficient renewable energy to meet its own demand. The proliferation of energy nationalism as a result of the global move towards renewable energy may therefore prove detrimental for Singapore and complicate its hub aspirations, given that it would stunt the global circulation of energy commodities. Singapore would have no global markets to serve, and no middleman role to play.Betting on green hydrogen'Hence Singapore's strategic investment into low-carbon hydrogen. This is reflected in significant policy documents, including the Energy Market Authority's (EMA) major report on Singapore's possible pathways to net zero, as well as the National Hydrogen Strategy launched in 2022. While hydrogen is not an energy source in and of itself but instead a carrier of energy, it can be produced by renewable energy sources, and is thereby labelled green hydrogen. There are several reasons behind this push. First, hydrogen can mimic natural gas in that it can be liquified and therefore be shipped across longer distances - and thereby traded. This spells potential for a global trading market. Second, there has also been some promise in the ability of hydrogen to be able to fuel both ships and aircraft. This means that there is potential for Singapore to simultaneously decarbonise its emissions-heavy industries. Last, for Singapore, which currently has most of its electricity derived from liquefied natural gas (LNG), there are also infrastructural benefits. Singapore has made moves to be an LNG hub, and the infrastructure supporting the use of LNG can be adapted relatively seamlessly for hydrogen use.As a clean \"alternative fuel\", green hydrogen thereby can lubricate Singapore's transition to a renewable energy hub.

The city-state -- regarded as a trusted broker in the COP28 negotiations -- lies \"at the vanguard of climate research\", and is a major player in climate finance. Yet, a key issue that has preoccupied Singapore is energy transition. As a \"renewable-energy disadvantaged\" nation, it ultimately has to rely on imports to meet its decarbonisation goals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On this score, the past year has been productive. Singapore has unveiled plans to import wind-powered renewable energy from Vietnam and also rapidly secured deals with Cambodia and Indonesia. These moves allow Singapore to hit, and potentially even surpass, its target of having 30 per cent of its electricity demand supplied by \"low-carbon\" imported sources by 2035. </p><p> Collaboration with fellow Asean member states is the more welcome given that every bilateral renewable energy trading link is a step towards the establishment of the elusive Asean Power Grid, a power-sharing arrangement in the region. It would build off the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, which proves the feasibility of bringing renewable energy across multiple borders.</p><p> Some challenges remain but, overall, the Singapore government's mission and drive on this front are more than evident. </p><p> Water and oil analogiesThe ability to hit its own domestic targets provides the platform for Singapore to look towards a bigger ambition: going beyond decarbonisation and energy security, and reconfiguring itself as a renewable energy hub.</p><p> The historical analogy often drawn by commentators and policymakers for Singapore's efforts to decarbonise its energy mix has been its proud \"water story\", which is perhaps a misleading comparison. The \"water story\", in brief, is a narrative about how resource-poor Singapore managed to overcome its dependence on imported water by leveraging developing technologies and a collective determination to achieve water self-sufficiency.</p><p> It might be more appropriate to think of Singapore replicating its history as an oil-trading state. While it produces no oil, it has had an essential role in global oil trade, by leveraging its strategic location at the southern tip of the Strait of Malacca and providing high-quality services in bunkering, oil pricing and associated services. </p><p>Singapore's \"oil story\" is no less important than its \"water story\". Playing a middleman role in distributing and re-exporting oil and petroleum-derived products has allowed Singapore to achieve several strategic objectives all at once. First, it has ensured a steady supply of oil for domestic use. Second, by playing a key role in the circulation of global commodities, it has established the Republic's relevance in the global political economy, a deeply entrenched foreign policy aim. And third, it has laid the foundation for a significant maritime industry, which contributes to its economic growth.</p><p>Singapore is seeking to replicate the strategy and recast itself as a renewable energy hub. </p><p> By leveraging its strategic location and advanced infrastructure, Singapore can position itself as the distribution point to serve markets around South-east Asia and potentially beyond. This would yield major strategic benefits, as outlined above. But it would require overcoming several obstacles.</p><p> Challenges to aspirationsOne of the more tricky challenges is having to navigate any links between renewable energy and energy nationalism. A big part of the draw of renewable energy is its ability to produce energy self-sufficiency. Global trends and events, especially the war in Ukraine, has alerted countries to the fragility of energy supply chains. </p><p> This has led to growing attention on and investments into renewable energy. As the International Renewable Energy Agency states, \"Renewable energy resources are available in one form or another in most countries, unlike fossil fuels which are concentrated in specific geographic locations. This reduces the importance of current energy choke points, such as the narrow channels on widely used sea routes that are critical to the global supply of oil.\" </p><p> Unfortunately, Singapore is an exception though -- unpropitious geographical circumstances mean that it cannot produce sufficient renewable energy to meet its own demand. </p><p> The proliferation of energy nationalism as a result of the global move towards renewable energy may therefore prove detrimental for Singapore and complicate its hub aspirations, given that it would stunt the global circulation of energy commodities. Singapore would have no global markets to serve, and no middleman role to play.</p><p> Hence Singapore's strategic investment into low-carbon hydrogen. This is reflected in significant policy documents, including the Energy Market Authority's (EMA) major report on Singapore's possible pathways to net zero, as well as the National Hydrogen Strategy launched in 2022. </p><p> While hydrogen is not an energy source in and of itself but instead a carrier of energy, it can be produced by renewable energy sources, and is thereby labelled green hydrogen. </p><p> There are several reasons behind this push. First, hydrogen can mimic natural gas in that it can be liquified and therefore be shipped across longer distances -- and thereby traded. This spells potential for a global trading market. </p><p> Second, there has also been some promise in the ability of hydrogen to be able to fuel both ships and aircraft. This means that there is potential for Singapore to simultaneously decarbonise its emissions-heavy industries. </p><p> Last, for Singapore, which currently has most of its electricity derived from liquefied natural gas (LNG), there are also infrastructural benefits. Singapore has made moves to be an LNG hub, and the infrastructure supporting the use of LNG can be adapted relatively seamlessly for hydrogen use.</p><p> As a clean \"alternative fuel\", green hydrogen thereby can lubricate Singapore's transition to a renewable energy hub. Singapore has made strategic moves towards this end, with GIC, its sovereign wealth fund, pumping capital into companies specialising in green hydrogen.</p><p> Eggs not all in one basketWhile the government is watching developments in green hydrogen closely, this is not to say that Singapore is putting all its eggs in one basket, or that green hydrogen is without sceptics. </p><p> Scholars have, for example, scrutinised the buzz around green hydrogen and raised queries around technical and commercial ambiguities.

The flow of oil has grown by roughly 800,000 barrels a day since early 2022, and analysts expect the industry to add 500,000 more barrels a day next year.The main driver of the production surge is a delayed response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which sent the price of oil to well over US$100 a barrel for the first time in nearly a decade. The wells that were drilled last year are now in full swing.With the surge in output, gasoline prices have fallen by close to US$2 a gallon since summer 2022 and are back to levels that prevailed in 2021. The increase in production has also provided the Biden administration with substantial leverage in its dealings with oil-exporting foes such as Russia, Venezuela and Iran while reducing its need to cajole more friendly countries such as Saudi Arabia to temper prices.But the comeback in US oil production poses big risks, too. More supply and lower prices could increase demand for fossil fuels when world leaders, who are meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are straining to reach agreements that would accelerate the fight against climate change.Scientists generally agree that the world is far from achieving the goals necessary to avoid the catastrophic effects of global warming, which is caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.\"We're achieving energy security and reducing inflation by leveraging high-emitting, carbon-intensive oil production,\" said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University. </p><p>\"We're going to need to address that conflict.\"The United States now exports roughly 4 million barrels a day, more than any Opec member except Saudi Arabia. On balance, the United States still imports more than it exports because domestic demand exceeds supply and many American refineries can more easily refine the heavier oil produced in Canada and Latin America than the lighter crude that oozes out of the shale fields of New Mexico, North Dakota and Texas.Nearly every extra barrel of American crude produced is being exported, mostly to Europe and Asia, where supplies are tight. In addition, the natural gas that often bubbles up with oil has led to record exports of gas and helped to lower prices for that fuel and for electricity, much of which is produced at gas-fired power plants in the United States.The surge in US production has helped to end the energy crisis that gripped Europe after Russia invaded Ukraine - at least for now. European countries have replaced much of the gas they were buying from Russia with gas from the United States, Qatar and other exporters. They have also reduced their use of natural gas, a phenomenon that a mild winter last year helped.\"There is a foreign policy dividend in keeping a lid on oil prices,\" said David Goldwyn, a leading energy diplomat in the Obama administration.Not long ago, the US oil industry was in deep trouble. It had suffered repeated busts since 2015, culminating in a collapse of prices during the pandemic. Investors fled. Exxon Mobil was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average, and some European oil companies announced plans to pivot from fossil fuels to renewables more quickly.With concerns over climate change growing, Joe Biden, during his 2020 presidential campaign, promised to stop drilling on federal lands and federal waters offshore. He also pledged to accelerate the transition to renewable energy and electric cars to drastically reduce the emissions responsible for climate change.But as president, Biden has taken a much different tack. Although he has supported green energy and battery-powered cars, he has also hectored oil companies to increase production in an effort to drive down prices for consumers. He has approved a large drilling project in Alaska over the objections of environmentalists and a small number of offshore oil and gas permits.Biden has been under pressure from some Democrats to trumpet gains in oil production as a way of reaching out to voters who are leery of high gas prices. He has yet to do so - but his administration has not complained about the production, either.John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said the administration was committed to keeping energy prices low.\"The president is going to keep focusing, as he has been, on a healthy global market that's properly balanced and that can continue to bring the price of gasoline down here in the United States,\" Kirby said.The pandemic took a heavy toll on US oil production, which fell to just over 11 million barrels a day at the end of 2020 from 13 million at the end a year earlier. Dozens of oil companies went out of business, and the number of rigs in use fell to 350 in 2020, from 800, as thousands of field workers lost their jobs.Most of the new US oil production is coming from the Permian Basin, which straddles Texas and New Mexico. There are also some new projects and expansions in Alaska and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.\"It's the mother of all comeback stories,\" said Robert McNally, who was a senior energy adviser under President George W.

For Ms Marlina, it is clear how climate change affects her daily life - the heat in her flat has become increasingly unbearable and air-conditioning units, even portable ones, are considered a luxury for her family. The community worker said that the heat adds not only to her stress at work but poses financial stresses as higher temperatures lead to increased water consumption, risk of skin problems and doctor's visits. Mr Syazwan, who runs the social platform Wan's Ubin Journal, spoke about emphasising the importance of including indigenous voices and history in policy planning and education of climate change. Drawing on his experience of learning his heritage as a descendant of the Ubin Orang Pulau from his mother, Mr Syazwan said: \"The Orang Pulau were champions of sustainability. They understood what nature provided for them and the symbiotic relationship between humans and nature.\" Rally organiser Kristian-Marc James Paul said that advocating for climate justice means being aware that climate change and the ways we tackle this issue is \"fundamentally related\" to other bread-and-butter issues. Besides speeches, environmental groups such as Students for a Fossil Free Future and the People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM.Haze), as well as civil society groups, such as Migrant Mutual Aid and Workers Make Possible, set up community booths to raise awareness about their causes. One activity available at the booths allowed participants to write postcards to MPs about the various concerns and suggestions that they had about climate change. By the end of the rally, about 300 postcards had been submitted. Mr Ho from LepakInSg, an environmental group, said that systemic change cannot be done alone and that the work of raising awareness included tedious tasks like reading reports and writing feedback. While individuals might feel jaded and powerless alone, Mr Ho said that the rally was a good reminder that while individuals \"cannot make a difference alone\", in a community, they could. Ms Nur Hazeerah Mohamed Basri, 29, a freelance fashion designer, agreed that being able to attend the rally in-person was heartening because she met other people who felt strongly about the environment and now feels less alone. \"Even if they might think about things in a different way, they still have the same end goal, and I think it's really cool to build community as we go through this together,\" said Ms Nur who uses sustainable materials and practices in her craft since learning about waste in the fashion industry.

WHY DON'T S'POREANS SEE CLIMATE CHANGE AS AN URGENT MATTER? The Southeast Asia Climate Outlook Survey Report 2023, which was published on Thursday by the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, showed that climate advocacy in Singapore is lower than other countries in the region. Only 43.7 per cent of Singaporeans polled believe that climate change \"is a serious and immediate threat to the well-being of the country\", a significant drop from 66.4 per cent in 2021, but a slight increase from 40.5 per cent in 2022. The survey showed that fewer Singaporeans took steps to sign climate change related petitions (17.6 per cent) and attend protests (3.2 per cent) compared to Asean's average of 18.2 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively. When asked about why Singaporeans seem to view climate change as much less of an urgent issue as compared to our neighbours, Mr Paul said discussing climate change may not be a \"muscle\" that Singaporeans commonly use, but that the rally hopes to be a space to start conversations about climate change and how it affects society in uneven ways. Hoping that climate awareness would become less of a \"niche\" issue, Ms Ardhanari said that while a small group of Singaporeans may have a \"high level of awareness\", overall climate awareness in Singapore has not caught up to the scale and nature of impact of climate change. She added that Singaporeans could no longer afford to remain in \"echo chambers\" around climate change. \"This is something that affects all of us, but it seems like the people who want to talk about it is a very small group of people, and are often disconnected with the people who are facing the most of who are most vulnerable to impact.\"</p>", "publisher": "Today (Singapore) - Online", "instances": ["Drawing on his experience of learning his heritage as a descendant of the Ubin Orang Pulau from his mother, Mr Syazwan said: \"The Orang Pulau were champions of sustainability.

And 120 countries co-sponsored a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) landmark resolution introduced by Vanuatu in March this year for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on climate change-related obligations. </p><p>Two UN groups, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) together with the Small Island Developing Countries (SIDS), have become lobby champions against climate change. The present chair of AOSIS, Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Mata'afa, has rallied UN member states for the upcoming COP-28 in Dubai to press for more progress on \"loss and damage finance\". </p><p>PIF countries have also demanded simplified access to climate financing, more investments in disaster risk reduction and early warning systems, and raised concerns about insufficient grants, inadequate funding for adaptation, and a lack of locally-led climate action initiatives.  </p><p>Infrastructure financing, until recently the niche for China and Japan, has become the flavour of the day.  </p><p>Pacific Island countries are leaders in the global fight against climate change. They have been pushing the global agenda on the ocean and climate change connection, and on climate justice. </p><p>Spiralling debt problem </p><p>According to the Lowy Aid Map, aid to the Pacific was up 47% during the Covid-19 crisis. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had tripled its aid and became the biggest and Australia the second biggest development partner. But nowadays, almost half of the aid are concessional loans, not grants. Infrastructure financing, until recently the niche for China and Japan, has become the flavour of the day. </p><p>In 2021, the ADB provided 34% of all infrastructure loans, Australia 18%, China 15%, Japan 12%, World Bank 6% and the EU 4%. Pacific countries are now in a position to be choosy about their partners for much-needed infrastructure investments. </p><p>Unfortunately, this will also increase already precarious debt levels. According to a 2021 IMF report, six Pacific countries were at high risk of debt distress after the economic downturn during the Covid-19 pandemic. The three major creditors are the ADB, China and the World Bank. </p><p>China's strategic goals in the region </p><p>The Pacific Island region has long been important to China's geostrategic interests. China has pursued various goals in its engagement with the Pacific: seeking naval access to the region, achieving diplomatic victories against Taiwan, securing fishing and seabed mining rights in the vast economic zones of the Pacific States, and protecting its Chinese diaspora.  </p><p>China's development assistance to the Pacific peaked in 2016 (US$287 million). In 2020, it was US$187 million, the lowest since 2008. This downward trend continued in 2021.  </p><p>China has become the largest trading partner for most Pacific Island countries. It has invested in ten Pacific countries within the framework of its Belt and Road Initiative and built numerous large infrastructure projects which it financed by loans. These were projects which other countries or donor institutions were not able or not willing to finance. </p><p>China has also provided generous scholarship programmes and training facilities to a number of countries in the region and established six Confucius Institutes. Numerous high-level diplomatic visits, among them two visits by Chinese President Xi Jinping, have highlighted China's interest in the region as early as 2012. </p><p>Development financing and security agreements remain key diplomatic tools for China. According to last year's Lowy Institute Pacific aid analysis, China's development assistance to the Pacific peaked in 2016 (US$287 million). In 2020, it was US$187 million, the lowest since 2008. This downward trend continued in 2021. One of the reasons for this lies in the slowdown of the Chinese economy. </p><p>China's infrastructure financing now focuses mainly on two countries: Kiribati and the Solomons Islands. In 2019, these countries switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. China subsequently financed three major projects in the Solomon Islands: a Huawei telecommunications project, the upgrade of its major port and a sports stadium for the ongoing Pacific Games, a pet project of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. </p><p>Recent US steps in the Pacific </p><p>In 2022, the Biden administration of the US kickstarted its rather dormant engagement with Pacific Island countries with a number of high-ranking political and military visits, among them that of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the first visit of a US secretary of state in 40 years, and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who attended the PIF Leaders Meeting in July last year. President Joe Biden twice hosted PIF heads of government at a US-Pacific summit at the White House in November 2022 and in September this year. The US also announced the US-Pacific Partnership Strategy, a roadmap to strengthen cooperation with the Pacific. </p><p>After having reduced its aid to the Pacific in the years before, President Biden last year announced a US$810 million aid package, spread over 10 years, of which US$130 million was designated for climate change projects. The US government also pledged support in the control of illegal fishing, with the US Coast Guard assisting to strengthen local capabilities, especially in Papua New Guinea (PNG).  </p><p>Fiji has become a focal point of the US's Pacific Islands strategy.  </p><p>The US has had longstanding relations with its strategically important Compacts of Free Association (COFA) allies, Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia, which received the lion's share of US aid and investments in the Pacific. It recently signed an unprecedented package of US$7 billion over 20 years with the three countries, almost double the amount of the previous Compact package. The US hopes that they will remain US partners despite Chinese efforts to pull them into its orbit. </p><p>The US also increased its diplomatic presence in Pacific countries by reopening its embassy in the Solomon Islands after 30 years of absence, established diplomatic relations with the Cook Islands and Niue, and opened a USAID office in Fiji and embassies in Tonga, Kiribati and Vanuatu. </p><p>Fiji has become a focal point of the US's Pacific Islands strategy. Both countries strengthened security ties with a landmark Defence and Security Agreement in 2020. The US also pledged help in controlling illegal fishing. The US and Fiji have also concluded a Trade and Investment Treaty (TIFA). Fiji as the only Pacific Islands country also joined the 14-member US economic initiative Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). </p><p>In tandem with the US, Australia and New Zealand have also intensified their longstanding relations with the Pacific, especially with Fiji, Vanuatu and PNG. Australia increased its aid to the Pacific, slightly improved its previously unambitious climate policy and pledged to work with Pacific Island countries on a more equal footing. However, Australia's recent and much-touted security agreement with Tuvalu, which also gives Australia veto power in Tuvalu's foreign and security affairs, seems to be an ominous sign for equal partnership cooperation with the Pacific.  </p><p>Lack of trade agreements and access to the US market compares unfavourably to China which has become the leading trading partner for most Pacific countries.  </p><p>Potential pitfalls </p><p>There could be potential pitfalls for the US re-engagement. US trade with the Pacific (except with the Compact states) remains minimal. Lack of trade agreements and access to the US market compares unfavourably to China which has become the leading trading partner for most Pacific countries. </p><p>The US as well as China are competing with many other players who have been active for a long time such as Australia, New Zealand, the Asian Development Bank, Japan, and the EU. Pacific countries have more choices as to their development partners. </p><p>Pacific countries fear being drawn into a potential regional conflict between the US and China. Memories of American and French nuclear tests in the Pacific and insufficient compensation for nuclear damage explain some negative reactions to the AUKUS partnership. There is concern about nuclear-propelled submarines in the South Pacific. Without careful consultations, this complex issue could create divisions between Pacific Island nations and AUKUS member countries. </p><p>The US and Australia need to check their domestic and international climate policies. Granting of drilling rights for US gas and oil explorations and approvals for Australian new coal projects as well as non-support of UN resolutions do not go down well with Pacific countries. </p><p>The US re-engagement with Pacific Island countries will not be judged by high-ranking visits or new embassies but by its willingness to address the Pacific Islands' major concern, i.e., climate crisis, to contribute towards sustainable development and to increase trade with the region. China will focus its diplomacy on a few selected countries, further increase its trade with the whole region and use some soft power. The geopolitical tug of war in its courtyard is an opportunity for Pacific Island nations. They will pragmatically pick the best development offers. Competition for influence in Oceania will increase. </p><p>This article was first published as aRSIS Commentaryon 27 November 2023. </p><p>Related:Fiji an important regional power broker as great power politics intensifies in the Pacific|China gearing up for intense competition in the Pacific|The South Pacific Ocean: Another battleground for China-US competition?</p>", "publisher": "ThinkChina", "instances": ["Infrastructure financing, until recently the niche for China and Japan, has become the flavour of the day.

Following the presentation of the GST text, Samoa lead negotiator Anne Rasmussen quickly requested the floor, explaining that her delegation had been consulting fellow members of the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis) and arrived late to the plenary.</p><p>\"We didn't want to interrupt the standing ovation, but we are confused,\" says Rasmussen. \"It seems you just gavelled the decision, and the small island states were not in the room.\"</p><p>\"We were working hard to coordinate the 39 small island developing states that are disproportionately affected by climate change, and so we were delayed in arriving here. So allow me, Mr President, to deliver the statement that we were going to deliver before this text was adopted,\" she adds.</p><p>While she commends the \"strong references to science\", Rasmussen says some paragraphs in the final text remain weak. \"We do not see any commitment or even an invitation from parties to peak emissions by 2025. We reference the science throughout the text and even in this paragraph, but then we refrain from agreeing to take the relevant action to act in line with what the science says we have to do.\"</p><p>Rasmussen adds: \"It is not enough for us to reference the science and make agreements that ignore what the science tells us we need to do. This is not an approach that we should be asked to defend.\"</p><p>She highlights Paragraph 11, which \"recognises the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country parties, especially those particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change\".</p><p>\"We have repeatedly requested that this be moved to the preamble to align with the Paris Agreement.

We do not consider Para[graph] 11 to have any effect on the obligations and benefits contained in the Paris Agreement and convention on the special circumstances of the seats and [least developed countries].\"</p><p>Speaking after Rasmussen, US climate envoy John Kerry highlights the standing ovation given to Samoa, which lasted longer than the one for Al-Jaber after the GST's conclusion. \"The applause that we just saw for Aosis is a clarion call to all of us about our obligation and responsibility over these next months to ensure we're reaching as far as we can to implement as fast as we can.\"</p><p>Kerry, the former US secretary of state under President Barack Obama, commends the work of negotiators. \"While all of us can find a paragraph, sentences or sections where we would have said it differently, where we would have liked it not to appear, we would have liked something else to appear; but in a multilateral venue, to have as strong a document as has been put together, I find is cause for optimism, cause for gratitude and cause for some significant congratulations to everybody here.\"</p><p>Tom Evans, policy adviser at global climate change think-tank E3G, says \"not everyone is ready to admit the truth of what's needed to avert climate disaster\".</p><p>He adds: \"Champions for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels - both small island states and major economies - have pushed the rest of the world to realise this transition cannot be stopped.

Al-Jaber's role as the head of the state oil company Abu Dhabi National Oil Company was already cause for concern, but he faced further controversy days before the summit began. Leaked briefing documents revealed the UAE had discussed fossil fuel deals with 15 nations.</p><p>The documents - obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working with the BBC - were prepared by the UAE's COP28 team for meetings with at least 27 foreign governments before the summit. In a Nov 26 report, the UAE team did not deny using COP28 meetings for business talks, maintaining that \"private meetings are private\".</p><p>After the summit's first weekend, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said in a televised interview on Dec 4 that the world's top oil exporter would \"absolutely not\" agree to a text that calls for the phase-down of fossil fuels.</p><p>He called out countries pushing for a phase-out of fossil fuel for their hypocrisy. \"I'm not naming names,\" he said. \"But those countries who believe in phasing out and phasing down hydrocarbons, you should come out and put together a plan for how, starting Jan 1, 2024.\"</p><p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), too, complicated matters. In a leaked letter dated Dec 6, Opec Secretary General Haitham Al-Ghais urged Opec+ members to reject draft texts that target fossil fuels.</p><p>Citing \"undue and disproportionate pressure against fossil fuels\", Al-Ghais urged members to \"proactively reject any text or formula that targets energy that is fossil fuels rather than emissions\".</p><p>Sentiment soured further after the second and final weekend of the talks, when a draft agreement released on Dec 11 dropped references to the phase-out of fossil fuels, a day before the talks were due to end.</p><p>This sparked widespread criticism from experts, including climate advocate and former US Vice President Al Gore, who said COP28 was \"on the verge of complete failure\". Gore says in a post on X: \"This obsequious draft reads as if Opec dictated it word for word. It is even worse than many had feared . It is deeply offensive to all who have taken this process seriously.\"</p><p>From the first weekend, Gore was critical of the host country, telling Reuters in Dubai that the UAE is \"abusing the public's trust by naming the CEO of one of the largest and least responsible oil companies in the world as head of the COP\".</p><p>Commenting on the final text, Gore calls the agreement \"the bare minimum we need\" and \"long overdue\". \"The influence of petrostates is still evident in the half measures and loopholes included in the final agreement.\"</p><p>He says fossil fuel interests \"went all out\" to control the outcome, \"but the passionate work of millions of climate activists worldwide inspired and motivated delegates from many nations to loosen the industry's grip\".</p><p>Gore adds: \"We must ask ourselves how much longer will the world have [to] wait before all nations summon the political will to overcome these narrow special interests and act on behalf of the future of humanity. It is up to all of us to hold our leaders accountable to their promise to transition away from fossil fuels once and for all.\"</p><p>As climate negotiators stare down one another in Dubai, the fossil fuel industry continues deal-making, doubling down on a business generating billions in supernormal profits over the past few years.</p><p>On Dec 12, Houston-based Occidental Petroleum shook hands with shale producer CrownRock in a US$12 billion ($16.13 billion) acquisition deal. The move by Occidental Petroleum, which Warren Buffett backs, is the latest in a slew of mega-billion M&amp;As in the oil industry over three months. On Oct 12, ExxonMobil announced it was buying Pioneer Natural Resources for US$60 billion and within days, Chevron announced the purchase of Hess for US$53 billion.</p><p>Singapore not a claimant</p><p>The climate summit had started strong, with world leaders agreeing on a loss and damage fund on the opening day. At least US$790 million has been pledged, and the fund will be hosted through the World Bank for the first four years.</p><p>Al-Jaber hailed the \"unprecedented\" speed of the agreement, which is intended to pay poorer countries for the harm caused by climate change.</p><p>Singapore will not claim from the loss and damage fund and will instead support fellow Aosis member states to receive money, says Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Dubai on Dec 11, Fu says the city-state \"does not intend to access this finance\". \"We will not be claiming from this fund, although we have to invest very significantly into coastal protection.\"</p><p>Following her ambiguous comments in Parliament in February, her comments ended speculation that the republic could be a potential claimant. \"Singapore belongs to [the] developing countries, and we stand as a potential claimant from this loss and damage fund,\" said Fu then. \"We have not even had the chance to discuss this internationally, and we have to decide whether to contribute or claim from this fund.\"</p><p>Singapore targets coal</p><p>The republic endeavoured to make itself heard at the summit. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) managing director Ravi Menon kickstarted the second edition of the Singapore Pavilion on Nov 30, which then hosted 12 days of announcements and panels.</p><p>Over a hectic weekend for Singapore's delegation, MAS launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (Singapore-Asia Taxonomy) on Dec 3, outlining detailed thresholds and criteria for defining green and transition activities contributing to climate change mitigation.</p><p>As the world's first taxonomy to pioneer the concept of a \"transition\" category, the Taxonomy adopts a \"traffic light\" classification system - \"green\" to denote activities that are aligned today with a 1.5\u00b0C outcome, and \"amber\" to denote activities that will move to \"green\" over a defined period, or facilitate significant emissions reductions in the short term.</p><p>Against the fossil fuel fracas, the Taxonomy provides a credible framework to phase out coal-fired power plants. This is a critical part of the energy transition in the Asia Pacific, says MAS, as coal accounts for almost 60% of power generation in the region.</p><p>Formerly referred to as the Singapore Taxonomy, the guidelines had been expected to be published in June. Instead, MAS sought feedback on additional criteria, such as the phase-out of coal-fired power plants.</p><p>Defining transition is particularly salient in Asia, says MAS. \"The progressive shift towards a net-zero economy is taking place alongside economic development, population growth and rising energy demands. Clarifying what constitutes sustainable and transition financing will also help reduce the risk of green or transition washing, as financial institutions will be able to identify and disclose how their financed activities and labelled products are aligned with the taxonomy.\"</p><p>Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean announced a new Asia-focused blended finance initiative that same day. He added that the government is prepared to contribute \"catalytic capital\" to support the partnership to mobilise up to US$5 billion for green and transition projects.</p><p>He first spoke about Financing Asia's Transition Partnership, or Fast-P, when delivering Singapore's national statement at COP28 a day prior. \"The initiative will draw on concessional capital to catalyse commercial capital from a range of partners, including multilateral development banks and philanthropists, in support of Asia's transition to net zero,\" says Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.</p><p>As Teo says, \"some partners\" have already pledged their support for Fast-P. \"We are confident that more will follow.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Singapore", "instances": ["He adds: \"Champions for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels - both small island states and major economies - have pushed the rest of the world to realise this transition cannot be stopped.

And few countries will be spared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Torrential monsoon rains, coupled with melting glaciers, submerged one-third of Pakistan's lands in September. The calamity left 1,500 people dead, washed away homes, destroyed livestock and racked up damage worth US$40 billion (S$54.7 billion). Worse, the Pakistan economy will suffer a further projected 3 percentage-point decline in gross domestic product growth in 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Even tested systems are drowning in water. Great powers like China were not spared after floods ravaged cities and wreaked havoc on its mountainous countrysides and busy cities during this year's monsoon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hurricane Ian tore through Florida and North and South Carolina in the United States in late September, with the devastation setting a new US$100 billion global record for insurance claims for a natural disaster.</p><p> Worryingly, this partial list does not include droughts and other extreme weather mayhem. From January through September, there were 29 weather-related disasters with losses of at least US$1 billion, according to insurance broker Aon, with the total economic cost still being counted. The estimate for 2021 was US$329 billion. </p><p> More valuable are the costs we cannot put figures to as climate change acidifies oceans, raises sea levels, alters ecologies and generates more extreme weather events: the loss of lives, biodiversity, heritage and the dangers to health. </p><p> A 'here and now' crisisBut loss may finally be giving way to action. At the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, delegates agreed to include \"loss and damage\" on the agenda, recognising the unavoidable, destructive impact of climate change even with best-laid plans to cut greenhouse gases and adapt to a changed climate.</p><p> This is a long time coming. The most vulnerable developing countries have demanded aid to cover permanent climate-related loss and repairable damage for more than 30 years. In 1991, the Alliance of Small Island States -- a coalition of 39 low-lying coastal nations -- called for help for countries most exposed to rising sea levels. </p><p> But the proposal had little traction, with rich countries -- responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions for the better part of three centuries -- resisting the idea. </p><p> Some baby steps have been taken in recent years. Countries agreed to set up The Santiago Network to catalyse the provision of technical assistance to vulnerable countries in managing climate risks at the Madrid COP25 in 2019. </p><p> But hesitancy continued swirling. At COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, rich countries pledged to start a two-year dialogue to discuss funding, but refused funding commitments. They feared opening themselves up to unlimited liabilities -- even though the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change stated that loss and damage would not involve compensation.</p><p> While true in a legal sense, the cold hard truth is that developed nations are some of the largest emitters, prospering through highly pollutive industrialisation. Yet it's poor countries, whose contributions to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions have been minuscule, which bear the brunt of destruction from climate-related natural disasters. It just doesn't seem fair.</p><p> Africa, which has 17 per cent of the world's population, accounts for less than 4 per cent of current global emissions. Understandably, poor countries believe, as Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados pointed out at Sharm El-Sheikh, that they have \"a moral and just cause\".</p><p> Climate justiceAt its core, loss and damage is about climate justice. This concept has been barely acknowledged in the climate debate, with scant mention. </p><p> The iconic 2015 Paris Agreement mentions the word \"justice\" only once in the preamble: \"The Parties to this agreement... noting the importance for some of the concept of 'climate justice'...\" (my emphasis in italics) -- making clear that justice does not have universal support.</p><p> But there is a budding change of heart. At the 2021 Glasgow summit, host Scotland committed US$2.2 million to loss and damage -- a drop in the bucket, but symbolically important as the first actual commitment of funds. </p><p> At this year's COP27, the president of the European Commission, Dr Ursula von der Leyen, endorsed the idea of separate funding for poor nations affected by loss and damage. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Ireland stepped forward with contributions. </p><p> But conspicuous by its absence from the list was the world's largest cumulative carbon emitter, the US. Perhaps mindful of the fraught political process required to secure funding for such an outlay from the country's divided Congress, US climate envoy John Kerry confined himself to supporting further discussion on loss and damage, but committed nothing.</p><p> Why have some rich countries changed their tune on funding loss and damage? Maybe with climate-related disasters having hit them, they have come to realise the shared nature of the threat and the tragedy of global commons. </p><p> Or maybe they recognise a key consequence of uncompensated climate-related damage long warned before: A surge of climate refugees heading to their shores from the Middle East, Africa and Central America. </p><p> Immigration can be a firecracker igniting policy innovation. Already, there are about three times more climate refugees than the number of people forced to flee armed conflicts, according to the Geneva-based research organisation Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. And the number is forecast to rise to 200 million by 2050, from 30.7 million in 2020.</p><p> The third pillar of climate financeWhile a financing mechanism for loss and damage has yet to be set up, the idea now at least has some support and more momentum. It will be the third pillar of climate finance to supplement funding for mitigation and adaptation. </p><p> Vulnerable countries, climate activists and non-governmental organisations have their wish lists on how such a mechanism should work. Its disbursements should be automatic, following incidences of climate-related loss and damage. </p><p> They should come primarily from countries that have contributed most to the climate crisis and the contributions should be mandated, not voluntary, ad hoc acts of charity. </p><p> The facility should be separate from humanitarian and development aid serving a different purpose. The amount pledged should also be in addition to the US$100 billion in climate finance rich countries had promised to transfer to the developing world by 2020 as part of COP16 in 2009 -- a pledge on which they have fallen short. </p><p> Some funding can be routed through multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as they raise their game on climate finance, but other sources of funding should also be explored.</p><p> Formidable obstaclesBut the idea of a loss and damage facility faces formidable obstacles, even leaving aside political hurdles. Already, there is a lack of enthusiasm for existing global climate initiatives, particularly in the US. </p><p> One issue will be determining what types of loss and damage the facility would cover and the extent to which they are caused by climate change. Many incidences of floods, for instance, are also the result of poor domestic policies, such as drainage channels being built over or the removal of mangroves, as well as deforestation and faulty land-use policies. </p><p> Air pollution can also be traced to generous fossil fuel subsidies, the absence of mitigating measures such as carbon taxes, stubble-burning -- seen in the seasonal transboundary haze afflicting South-east Asia -- uncontrolled construction activities and poor vehicle emission standards. </p><p> Transfers may have to be conditional on the adoption of minimum standards of mitigation and adaption. Opponents of a loss and damage facility after all would have powerful arguments to deny funding to countries guilty of such self-inflicted malpractices. </p><p> Standards and benchmarks must also be set, made transparent and be independently verifiable, to pre-empt gaming, corruption and the diversion of funds to other uses, with transfers to be closely monitored.</p><p> Then there are issues around the form that loss and damage funding should take, and its sources. Rich countries rely mainly on insurance, but this works poorly in developing countries.

The United Nations' (UN) Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change has issued a stark warning with its latest Synthesis Report that the repercussions of inaction are monumental. A broad consensus has already been established on the urgent practical steps required to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. We now only have a headroom of 0.4 deg C, with global warming at 1.1 deg C above pre-industrial levels. </p><p>To never get past 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels down the track, we will need to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and get to net-zero CO2 emissions around mid-century. While few would dispute the moral necessity of climate action today, the practical battle against climate change remains stagnant. A major mindset shift is needed for us to bridge the gap between belief and action. As renegade economist Kate Raworth pointed out in her book Doughnut Economics, economists now need to confront the reality that the environment is not separate from the economy and society. The 21st century economist will now need to think holistically to create a model that meets societal needs, protecting planetary boundaries and supporting human progress. Think of two concentric rings - an inner ring representing a social foundation that addresses life's essentials, and an outer ecological ceiling to protect planet Earth's life-supporting systems. Serving as a compass for human prosperity in the 21st century, the \"doughnut\" lies in the space between these two sets of boundaries that is both ecologically safe and socially just, where humanity can thrive.Doughnut economics: Building in circularity in how we consumeMany countries have announced national legislation and action plans to put the circular economy in motion. While there is no dearth of immediate circular value creation opportunities, the true value of a circular economy lies in wider systemic changes. China announced its five-year action plan in 2021 for reducing plastic pollution and effectively curbing white pollution by 2025 by cutting plastic production and usage, as well as promoting alternatives (such as bamboo, wood, paper and degradable plastics), especially in the retail, e-commerce and express delivery sectors, with the goal of significantly reducing plastic waste in landfills and environmental wastage. Here in Singapore, we are stepping up the national movement in support of the circular economy with the National Environment Agency's recent, islandwide initiative of reverse vending machines to recycle drink containers, and new guidelines proposing a charge on plastic bags. However, given the state of the climate emergency, our current recycling efforts are simply not enough. We need drastic changes in our lifestyles and expectations. It does mean curbing our consumption of \"modern conveniences\" - afforded by endless choice and a convenience culture - and being intentional when we make a purchase. We need to confront the inconvenient truth. Will there be additional waste generated through the consumption of each new material good? Will it have a long useful life? What happens at its end-of-life'The retail industry can play a role in supporting consumers to adopt sustainable practices. Retailers can encourage consumers to take bold action by building in the true cost of waste and ensuring a well-thought-through circular strategy for all the things that we use. While it's now common practice to charge for a disposable container, a better way would be to invest in a reusable container system and eliminate waste altogether. The industry has the opportunity to remake itself through value creation opportunities in retailers' interactions with suppliers and customers. How do brand owners circulate their products and materials in the system, and not downcycle them as waste'The hardest but most impactful part is in the start and end of life - when a product interfaces with nature. Rather than extracting materials and disposing of used products, companies need to move towards a regenerative model and supporting natural processes. Product companies need to rethink innovative ways to incorporate materials that are upcycled and renewable, which in turn encourage best practices across the supply chains. Climate justice: Rethinking our economy to redistribute valueWhile several major corporations are starting to pledge to achieve net-zero operations by the end of 2030, many are also looking at carbon credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions to reduce their tax liabilities. Despite the recent controversy around carbon credits, ensuring greater transparency on carbon offset projects and the benefit on indigenous and local communities can help to redirect financing to areas where real impact can be made.Higher taxes and stricter regulations may be needed for companies to reduce emissions, and minimise the extent to which companies can propagate vague net-zero pledges, as these may be misleading and could amount to greenwashing. Economists now need to consider how to redesign the flow of economic value to redistribute it for the sustainability of the environment and the community. To be effective, it is necessary for price signals to be sustained, strengthened and extended to a greater portion of global emissions. However, Asia has been unable to take concrete action owing to soaring inflation, rising energy prices and economic instability. While the region's carbon taxation is said to be too low to be punitive for major polluters, Singapore's increase of its carbon tax, now the highest in Asia, may well throw a curveball for companies that have not taken heed of the call to reduce emissions. Government revenue from the introduction of significantly higher carbon tax across the region could be redirected to adaptation measures, especially for vulnerable communities that are often the hardest hit by climate inaction.No Planet BAs the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres pointed out, \"the climate emergency is a race we are losing, but it is a race we can win\". As we face rising sea levels, melting ice caps, burning forests and dying coral reefs, inaction is not an option. To inspire bold action, we need to offer more than just rewards, dangling carrots for carrying out feel-good and do-good initiatives. We will need to make inertia too expensive for everyone with the stick approach. The most vulnerable among us will be the hardest hit. The most tangible form of charity is not to give our time or money (that helps too), but to slow down and ideally reverse the climate crisis - not to save the Earth, but to save ourselves.

The fossil fuel savings are equivalent to 9 per cent of total fossil fuel costs in these countries between January and June. </p><p> China has the greatest solar capacity in the world, with Japan, India, South Korea and Vietnam also being among the global top 10 states in terms of solar power generation. </p><p> In 2020, China had only 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar power, but it had ramped up capacity to 307GW by the end of 2021. This year, it is expected to add between 75GW and 90GW of new solar energy to its electricity grid. </p><p> Expanding its solar capacity has allowed China to meet 5 per cent of its total electricity demand within the first half of 2022, with US$21 billion avoided in additional coal and gas imports. </p><p>Vietnam, on the other hand, had close to zero terawatt hours of solar generation in 2018, but it has reached the point where solar power accounted for 11 per cent of electricity demand -- equivalent to 14 terawatts -- from January to June.  This has allowed the country to avoid US$1.7 billion in additional fossil fuel costs. </p><p> Although Vietnam rapidly expanded its solar capacity, the energy grid was not ready for a sudden increase in solar power, causing the solar output to fall by 30 per cent to 40 per cent in some areas, the report noted. </p><p> Though this has since improved, investment into new solar capacity has dropped dramatically, largely due to grid instability and continued delays to the country's eighth power development plan.</p><p> International companies and industries have been driving solar investments in the development of microgrids, for example, to feed their demand for clean energy sources. </p><p> Ember's Asia electricity analyst Achmed Shahram Edianto said Vietnam needs to reconfigure the whole power system around clean energy into its policy, and expanding solar power should go beyond alleviating power shortages. </p><p> \"Its upcoming power development plan should be to rebuild the country's power systems around clean energy, rather than one that merely incorporates a few more transmission lines, to alleviate the network bottlenecks,\" he added.</p><p> The report said that while growth in solar has been slower in Thailand and the Philippines, the avoided fuel costs have still been notable. </p><p> \"While solar accounted for only 2 per cent of Thailand's electricity in the first six months of 2022, an estimated US$209 million of potential fossil fuel costs were avoided,\" it said. </p><p> \"The Philippines avoided US$78 million in fossil fuel spending, despite solar accounting for only 1 per cent of (electricity) generation.\"  </p><p> The Philippines now has favourable policies towards solar energy, according to its recently revised energy plan, the report noted, adding that two of its largest players in solar now have substantial solar capacity that has been permitted or is under construction. </p><p> But access to financing for solar projects still proves challenging. </p><p>Thailand led Asean in solar investments in 2016 but has failed to keep pace with the rest of the region, with just under 600 megawatts of additional solar power since then, according to the report. </p><p> Therefore, while it may have the solar capacity, a more concerted decarbonisation effort is required.</p><p> Dr Edianto said one of the most significant barriers that the Philippines is facing in ramping up solar capacity was the notion that coal remains the cheapest energy source. </p><p> \"But current international market prices could show how vulnerable the countries that rely on import commodities such as gas and coal really are,\" he noted. </p><p> The report concluded that if these countries could meet their 2030 solar capacity targets, at least US$44 billion in fuel costs could be avoided. </p><p> The region's solar capacity is expected to acquire an average annual growth rate of 22 per cent a year till 2030 across China, India, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines.</p><p> This story was published with the support of Climate Tracker's COP27 Climate Justice Fellowship.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["The report concluded that if these countries could meet their 2030 solar capacity targets, at least US$44 billion in fuel costs could be avoided.

Such manual methods can be labour- and time-intensive, and are often more expensive in remote areas such as marine environments. <br/>Underwater line transect survey in a seagrass meadow <br/>Technologies such as acoustic monitoring, camera traps, and drones allow for more data on wildlife to be captured and analysed and hence provide an avenue to scale up monitoring for larger areas through: <br/>Accessing remote and previously inaccessible areas via drones and sensors Improving the efficiency of analytical processes e.g. sorting images via AI for species identification Enabling community-based monitoring and citizen science via mobiles apps where users can input data that are uploaded to cloud dashboards or open-source databases Alerting enforcement units to any illegal forest activities occurring through acoustic monitoring of forests, or measuring and monitoring biodiversity Environmental DNA[6] has emerged as a powerful tool to pick up on the presence of species in an area, both historical and present, based on trace amounts of samples <br/>Enforcement and monitoring of protected areas <br/>Tracking devices, camera traps, and other sensors can help with the enforcement of protected areas and track illegal wildlife activities through real-time monitoring and alerting rangers of any anomalies in the area. <br/>The Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool[7] (SMART) exemplifies the use of a technology platform, coupled with conservation capacity-building activities to empower communities to manage conservation areas. <br/>Unlocking additional finance for biodiversity conservation <br/>Web3 generally refers to the next phase of the web characterised by decentralisation and distributed networks, particularly blockchain-based technology. <br/>Blockchain has been promoted as a solution to enable transparency and traceability of restoration projects, while the sale of carbon or ecosystem tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have been adopted as business models to raise funds for wildlife conservation. <br/>Conservation technology is not a panacea: Challenges and limitations <br/>A key challenge lies in the accessibility of MRV technologies due to costs and affordability, especially for newer technologies that have yet to scale commercially. Technologies such as eDNA are still prohibitively expensive for most projects; they are mostly used in academic research and are less accessible to lower-income communities. <br/>Also Read: As the demand for energy soars, climate tech is here to save the day[8] <br/>These tools can also be inaccessible due to technical expertise and capacity gaps. For example, GIS software often requires specialist knowledge to generate analytical information. <br/>Biodiversity measurement techniques and methodologies are just as important as the tools used. As compared to well-established protocols for manual data collection for forests or coral reef surveys, there is currently no standard for analysing some of the data from emerging technologies, such as eDNA. <br/>Moreover, we are just beginning to explore and understand some of the unintended impacts that conservation technologies may have on wildlife and nature. For instance, there are (inconclusive) studies[9] on how drones can result in behavioural and physiological changes in animals and debates regarding the invasive nature of biologging devices. <br/>On the crypto front, there have been criticisms regarding the environmental impact of blockchain-based tokens, given that blockchain technology is energy-intensive and contributes to carbon emissions that need to be accounted for. <br/>Additionally, given the distributed network of data input and verification, there is currently no standard ensuring that robust measurement methodologies are used and quality data about the conservation or restoration project is recorded onto each 'block' when creating tokens or NFTs. <br/>Thus, third-party verifiers, standard-setting organisations, and regulators still play a role in standardising the quality of credits in the market. <br/>Holistic frameworks and project designs are vital <br/>Conservation technology presents an exciting opportunity[10] for revolutionising the way we measure and evaluate projects, through providing new data, expanding the spatial extent of existing data, or providing real-time information for prompt intervention. <br/>However, biodiversity conservation will require more than tech fixes; ultimately, the agency lies with the people who design and deliver the intervention. Community engagement and capacity building are core to project design and implementation, and ultimately a project's sustainability. <br/>Rather than seeking to replace manual data collection, technologies can be used to enhance community-based monitoring in project areas that are also home to local communities and indigenous groups. <br/>Nonetheless, the race against the ongoing sixth extinction event demands that we act fast, and catalyse scalable solutions for conservation and regeneration.

The floods and mudslides killed more than 440 people, leaving thousands homeless and houses and infrastructure in ruins.</p><p> \"This is part of the new normal that a city like mine is going to have to deal with,\" said Dr Roberts in her keynote speech on Monday at SIWW on how climate change is affecting water systems.</p><p> Scientists believe the south-eastern coast of Africa is becoming more vulnerable to violent storms and floods as greenhouse gases are warming the Indian Ocean.</p><p> Dr Roberts, 61, co-chairs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Working Group 2, which released its major report in February. She highlighted the sobering implications that rising temperatures, sea-level rise and other indicators will have.</p><p> \"Our report shows very clearly that two-thirds of all adaptation is in response to water-related hazards,\" she said. Adaptation refers to implementing ways to reduce climate risks, such as building seawalls to keep out rising sea levels.</p><p> In an interview with The Straits Times yesterday on the sidelines of SIWW 2022, Dr Roberts noted that nature-based solutions play a key role in managing water-related impacts. For example, restoring floodplains and wetlands can help to reduce flood risks, as wetlands enable more natural water retention. Restoring mangroves will help mitigate climate change impacts with their ability to soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide.</p><p> But nature-based solutions will start to fall off the table as the temperature increases beyond the 1.5 deg C threshold, she warned.</p><p> Limiting warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels is a key goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p><p> \"By the time we reach global warming levels of 1.5 deg C, we will probably experience irreversible losses of warm water coral reefs and coastal wetlands, so they won't be able to play that (adaptation) role,\" she noted.</p><p> Moreover, poor planning can cause adaptation measures to backfire and spark other environmental issues, she warned. For example, sea walls at some coastal sites can cause coastal erosion further down the coastline.</p><p> She also emphasised that science and technology, and the knowledge of indigenous people should be brought together to tackle the climate crisis since those local communities know their land well.</p><p> Dr Roberts recounted how an Inuit hunter from Canada had noticed that an ice sheet was about to break off. However, satellite images did not spot anything wrong with the glacial ice.</p><p> \"But that ice sheet broke away.

Indeed, one running joke about Canadians is that the first words that come out from their mouths are often \"I'm so sorry...\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Against this backdrop, it was truly shocking to hear a Canadian politician say on BBC Radio that Canada's actions on climate change would not make a real difference since the country contributed only 1.5 per cent of current global emissions. She added that it was all up to China and India, the largest new emitters, to save the world from climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Superficially, this claim by a Canadian politician seems reasonable. Indeed, it is highly likely that many Singaporeans will buy into this hugely unfair and unjust Western perspective on climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This is why it is important for Singaporeans to understand the real story of climate change, especially in the build-up to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (or COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland on Nov 1.</p><p> To paraphrase Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, there are three \"hard truths\" that its people should know.</p><p> The first hard truth is that climate change is not happening just because of the new \"flows\" of greenhouse gases from newly developing countries like China and India. Climate change is also a result of the \"stock\" of greenhouse gas emissions put up by the Western industrialised countries, including Canada, since the Western Industrial Revolution began two centuries ago.</p><p> BBC commentators regularly refer to China as the world's \"largest emitter\" of greenhouse gas emissions. This is true only if \"flows\" are measured. But if the \"stocks\" are added to the picture, the largest emitter in cumulative terms is the US. Here is the data for the \"stocks\" of carbon dioxide emissions: the contribution of the US is 25 per cent, the European Union 22 per cent, China 13 per cent and India 3 per cent. For the record, Canada's historical contribution is 2 per cent.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;DIFFERENTIATED RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; To be fair, in all the early negotiations on how to cope with climate change, the Western countries acknowledged their historical contributions and accepted that they had to contribute more to fight climate change. This is why the UN agreed on the concept of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" during the first Earth Summit held in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro in 1992, with developed countries (then known as Annex I countries) doing more and developing countries (non-Annex I countries) doing less.</p><p> The Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997, rested on these key pillars: legally binding commitments by the wealthy Annex I countries to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and a set of mechanisms including clean development, emissions trading and joint implementation to help countries efficiently reduce emissions.</p><p> If the Kyoto Protocol had been faithfully implemented by all the parties since its adoption, we would have seen 24 years of effective actions taken against climate change. Unfortunately, the Bush administration (from 2001-2009) decided to walk away from the Kyoto Protocol.</p><p> Traditionally, it would have been the responsibility of the host country (in this case, Japan) to fight for and defend the Kyoto Protocol. But the then Japanese government, in a sad act of cowardice, failed to defend the protocol. It instead sought to weaken the agreement. Many precious years were lost in the fight against climate change.</p><p>  To be fair, in all the early negotiations on how to cope with climate change, the Western countries acknowledged their historical contributions and accepted that they had to contribute more to fight climate change.</p><p> This is why the UN agreed on the concept of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" during the first Earth Summit held in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro in 1992, with developed countries (then known as Annex I countries) doing more and developing countries (non-Annex I countries) doing less.</p><p>    Since the world's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases had walked away from its Kyoto Protocol obligations, it would have been reasonable for new emitters, especially China and India, to also walk away from international agreements on climate change.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; The second hard truth they could have used to justify their refusal to join any international agreement is that on a per capita basis, China and India still contribute far less to carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p> The respective figures for the major countries and regions are: the US (15.5 tonnes), Germany (9.4 tonnes), China (7.4 tonnes), India (1.9 tonnes), Australia (17.1 tonnes), Canada (18.6 tonnes). For the record, only European countries have made significant progress in reducing their per capita emissions, averaging 6.4 tonnes.</p><p> It was an extraordinary act of responsibility for China and India to return to the global negotiating table on climate change and accept a whole new agreement on climate change after the Bush administration had walked away from the Kyoto Protocol.</p><p> The result was the famous Paris Agreement of December 2015, at COP21. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, where countries like China and India did not take on any obligations, the Paris Agreement called on all countries, both developed and developing, to make contributions.</p><p> Specifically, the Western developed countries agreed to make deeper cuts in emissions. But this also required the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities to be diluted.</p><p> Instead of the legally binding commitments for wealthy countries in the Kyoto Protocol, countries were allowed to set their own targets. All that was required was domestic political will. It was hoped that this would dissuade countries like the US from withdrawing from painstakingly negotiated agreements again.</p><p> The whole world breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Paris Agreement was reached. This sigh of relief did not last long. After the Trump administration came into office in January 2017, it walked away from the Paris Agreement. Four more years were lost in the battle against climate change.</p><p> When the Trump administration refused to respect its commitments under the Paris Agreement, many feared that China and India, as well as other developing countries like Brazil or Indonesia, would be given the opportunity to follow suit. Doing so would certainly have killed the Paris Agreement.</p><p> Instead, once again, in another massive act of responsibility, China and India, and the rest of the world, respected their commitments. This left the door open for the US to return when Mr Joe Biden became President.</p><p> What is truly remarkable here is that China has not just met its commitments, it has also enhanced them. When President Xi Jinping announced that China would become carbon neutral by 2060, a well-known scholar, Professor Adam Tooze of Columbia University, said that President Xi may have saved the planet with these new contributions.</p><p> Prof Tooze wrote that \"China's leader may have redefined the future prospects for humanity... As the impact of his remarks sank in, climate modellers crunched the numbers and concluded that, if fully implemented, China's new commitment will by itself lower the projected temperature increase by 0.2-0.3 deg C. It is the largest favourable shock that their models have ever produced\".</p><p> All this brings us back to the claim by the Canadian politician that it is up to China and India to do more. Canada, whose per capita income is US$46,327 (S$62,425) in 2019, has not reduced its per capita emissions of carbon dioxide by much. At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, its emissions per capita was 20.5 tonnes. By the Paris Agreement in 2015, Canada's number was 19 tonnes. China and India, whose per capita income in 2019 is much lower at US$10,217 and US$2,101 respectively, also have much lower per capita emissions at 7.4 and 1.9 tonnes.</p><p> A lot of Canada's emissions is due to the hugely damaging tar sands fracking project in its state of Alberta. As the distinguished environmentalist and writer Bill McKibben points out, the Alberta tar sands \"would produce about a hundred and twelve billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is 28 per cent of the world's total remaining carbon budget if we want to have a 50 per cent chance (not a guarantee - a 50 per cent chance) of meeting the climate goals we set in Paris\".</p><p> He adds: \"Lay aside for the moment the devastation caused by mining the sludgy tar sands for oil. There's no way that a country with less than 1 per cent of the world's population can lay claim to more than a quarter of the atmosphere.\"</p><p> Canadian leaders have spoken passionately about the danger of climate change. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said: \"Canada is a committed partner in the global fight against climate change, and together we will build a cleaner and more prosperous future for all.\"</p><p> So this is the final hard truth: Will rich countries abandon environmentally irresponsible projects like tar sands to save planet Earth'</p><p> The answer to this question will determine the future of planet Earth.</p><p>\u00b7 Kishore Mahbubani, a veteran diplomat, is a distinguished fellow at the Asia Research Institute (ARI) at the National University of Singapore, and the author of Has The West Lost It? and Has China Won'</p><p>\u00b7 Bertrand Seah is a research assistant at the ARI.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 60, "title": "Financing the region's renewable power grid", "published": "2022-12-18", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> While the sight of wind farms by the coast and rows of solar panels floating across a reservoir may have become familiar in the region, what escapes attention are the cables that connect the electricity generated from these projects to households. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Indeed, energy analysts told The Sunday Times that the upgrading of grid infrastructure in South-east Asia to integrate the increasing use of renewable energy still remains an overlooked area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> To boost funding for the green transition, the European Union announced at the Asean-EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday that it would put forward a EUR10 billion (S$14.4 billion) investment package for Asean till 2027.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This will include investments in clean energy, and the \"integration of electricity infrastructure\" and electricity markets in Asean, said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. </p><p> Current grid infrastructure, which typically transmits electricity from fossil fuels such as coal and gas, are often not able to withstand the variability of renewable energy, which requires striking a balance between peak supply (when there is plenty of sunshine or wind) and peak demand (which might be during the night) from consumers. </p><p> A failure to strengthen the grid, as was the case in Vietnam, will limit the growth of renewables, said global research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie's head of power and renewables consulting for the Asia-Pacific Melvin Chen. </p><p> Solar capacity there had expanded rapidly from 2018 to 2020, but as the energy grid was not ready for a sudden increase in power, solar output had to be restricted by up to 40 per cent in some areas.</p><p> Though the situation has since improved, investments in new solar capacity have dropped dramatically, largely due to grid instability and continued delays to the country's latest power development plan, according to a report published in November by environmental think-tank Ember, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).</p><p> One solution to manage the variability of renewables would be through battery storage, where excess electricity is saved for periods of high demand. However, battery technology for renewables is still years away from cost competitiveness, said Mr Chen.</p><p> A significant amount of funding would be needed to upgrade the electricity grid to accommodate more renewables. But most electricity markets in South-east Asia are still regulated and operated by a single, state-owned grid operator, which may not be able to generate the funding necessary without private-sector investments, he added. </p><p> According to a report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2022, more than 70 per cent of grid investments in South-east Asia were from state-owned enterprises, but greater involvement by the private sector is needed if greenhouse gas emissions are to be cut rapidly and the global temperature rise kept to 1.5 deg C.</p><p> While policy changes, such as in Vietnam, may allow foreign investments for the grid, this could still be challenging without a clear regulatory environment and revenue framework for investors, said Mr Chen.</p><p> Dr Rishikesh Ram Bhandary, a climate finance expert at the Boston University Global Development Policy Centre, said another difficulty in mobilising private-sector investments for renewables would be that it is still profitable to invest in fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. </p><p> The IEA report noted that for every dollar invested in renewable power in South-east Asia in recent years, another dollar was also invested in fossil fuel generation. </p><p> This means investments in renewables are \"heavily reliant\" on policy incentives and stable regulatory frameworks. In South-east Asia, the cost of capital is also high, which has a direct bearing on profitability, Dr Bhandary added.</p><p> Lack of international climate financeBut climate finance, channelled from rich nations to poorer ones to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions, has also not been sufficient. </p><p> At the COP27 conference held in Egypt in November, a report released by the United Nations high-level expert group on climate finance found that developing countries would need to spend US$2.4 trillion (S$3.26 trillion) a year on climate-related issues by 2030, underscoring a need to scale up climate finance exponentially to help them.  </p><p> But developed nations once again failed to make good on their US$100 billion target, which was meant to be delivered annually to developing countries from 2020 to 2025 to help them green their economies and adapt to climate change. </p><p> Instead, they emphasised the role of private finance in helping to increase the overall scale of climate finance. </p><p> Dr Bhandary, the climate finance expert, said that not fulfilling the US$100 billion pledge not only impacts the amount of finance available to South-east Asian countries but also curtails the \"catalytic role\" played by public finance from these countries in mobilising private finance. </p><p> Due to the lack of financing, the Climate Investment Funds' (CIF) Renewable Energy Integration programme -- an investment programme that will help developing countries transform their power grids to carry a larger share of renewables -- still has a number of countries on its waitlist, unable to marshal the funds to carry out works.</p><p> The programme, which was introduced at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November 2021, was extended to Columbia, Fiji, Kenya, Mali and Ukraine, each of which received a toolbox of financial instruments and technical assistance. </p><p> Each of these countries was invited to submit an investment plan. Examples of projects that were eligible for financing included developing battery storage solutions or investing in grid interconnectors to integrate various regional markets.</p><p> Another five countries, Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia and Turkey, were also invited to develop their investment plans, and were then placed on the waitlist for the next phase of the programme.</p><p> Giving an update to The Sunday Times in December, CIF's clean energy lead Daniel Morris said that the five countries will remain on the waitlist until more financial resources -- from government donors and the private sector -- are made available.</p><p> Stressing the difficulties in pooling more finance due to competing demands, Mr Morris said his team remains \"hopeful\" that the resources would come through for them to implement all their investment plans.</p><p> \"But even if we aren't able to gather more finance, the hope is that the exercise of undertaking an investment plan will set these countries up for success if other types of resources become available, or if they decide to divert domestic resources for their grid upgrades,\" he added.</p><p> Financing the Asean gridWithout sufficient finance being channelled to upgrade domestic electricity grids, some experts are sceptical that these countries would be in a position to export clean energy via the Asean grid, at least in the next few years. </p><p> The Asean grid would connect the national power grids of the current 10 member countries to enable them to trade and transfer electricity to one another.</p><p> Dr Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior principal fellow at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute, said doing so would allow for more efficient use of resources. For instance, joint investments in transmission lines could save countries from having to tap their own expenditure in creating new power generation capacity. Clean energy can also be transmitted from areas with surplus energy to areas with a deficit, which brings about energy security, he added.</p><p> But the Global Wind Energy Council's South-east Asia taskforce chair Mark Hutchinson said the costs of building long transmission lines between countries could be very expensive, and that it would make more economic sense for countries to build their own domestic renewable energy projects before turning to exports. </p><p> \"Most countries, at the moment, are really focusing on meeting their own climate targets and are not likely to export a significant share of their clean energy until maybe well into the 2030s,\" he added.</p><p> To share electricity between countries, transmission lines could either go through a few countries, as with the Laos hydropower project that exports energy to Singapore via transmission lines in Thailand and Malaysia, or electricity could be transmitted directly from one country to another via subsea cables.  </p><p> Both options are very expensive, and would depend on the amount of electricity being transmitted, noted Mr Hutchinson. </p><p> Currently, the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project exports only 100MW of renewable energy to Singapore, which is at a very small scale that does not require any infrastructural upgrades, he added.</p><p> The 100MW accounts for about 1.5 per cent of Singapore's peak electricity demand in 2020 and could power around 144,000 four-room Housing Board flats for a year.</p><p> But when infrastructure upgrades are needed, the question of who pays for them becomes critical, said Mr Hutchinson. </p><p> Grid upgrades in Thailand and Malaysia would be needed to deliver large-scale renewable energy from Laos, but these upgrades would also provide stability to the Thai and Malaysian grids. Allocating the significant costs of grid upgrades between the sellers (for example, Laos), the transit countries (Thailand and Malaysia) and the buyer (Singapore) can get very complicated, Mr Hutchinson noted. </p><p> However, investment in transboundary transmission lines has generally been low, said Dr Andrews-Speed. </p><p> \"A large proportion of lines are from hydroelectric dams in Laos to neighbouring countries, mainly Thailand. These are generally based on bilateral power purchase agreements linked to specific dam projects,\" he added. </p><p> And even within archipelagic countries such as Indonesia, investment in transmission lines between islands has also been low.  </p><p> The funding for transmission lines would have to come from the grid company for one or both of the countries involved, or the developer of a power project who wants to sell the power. </p><p> Many Asean grid companies are generally state-owned, however, and, in some cases, lack the financial capacity or willingness to invest in more infrastructure.</p><p> To help prop up the Asean grid, the IEEFA's energy, economy and policy specialist Putra Adhiguna said that Singapore, with its higher gross domestic product per capita and aggressive push to decarbonise its industries, has the ability to pay a premium for its green energy when importing from neighbouring countries.</p><p> \"That way, countries which have the potential, but not yet the domestic demand to drive their renewable deployment to an economic scale, can export to countries like Singapore to begin with,\" Mr Adhiguna added. </p><p> This, he said, would provide these countries with the \"strategic opportunity\" to kick-start their domestic renewable energy production, which they can leverage in the longer run to green their economies and meet their climate targets. </p><p> This story was published with the support of Climate Tracker's COP27 Climate Justice Fellowship, which the writer was awarded to cover COP27.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["\"That way, countries which have the potential, but not yet the domestic demand to drive their renewable deployment to an economic scale, can export to countries like Singapore to begin with,\" Mr Adhiguna added.

Remote working is here to stay, and here's what you need to know. The year is 2016. I had just moved to Metro Manila, one of the densest metropolitans in the world with a population of just under 13 million in a land area of 619 square kilometers. With this many people, a typical daily commute from Quezon City to the bustling business district of Ortigas meant spending forty minutes in traffic from my house to the closest train station, thirty minutes to fall in line and squeeze myself inside a packed train, twenty minutes to get to the station closest to my work, and another twenty minutes to walk to the office. </p><p>By the time I arrive, I would already be exhausted from the mere act of getting there on time, and often drenched in sweat after spending two hours inside packed vehicles under the blinding tropical heat. This means, a typical workday for me consisted of nine hours at the office and four more hours on the road. This is just a conservative estimate as the 12-hour workday I illustrated operates under three important assumptions: that I don't spend more of my hours doing extra work, that the weather is being cooperative, and that our often unreliable third world transport system isn't clunking out. I was not alone in this predicament. People all over Metro Manila have to deal with the exact same problems, while those in other similarly dense cities around the world like Mumbai and Dhaka have to contend with their own versions of the same harrowing story. To be able to work remotely cuts back four full hours from my workday and relieves me from the violence and terror that a tedious commute system entails. With remote working, not only am I able to perform better, but conversely, the companies I work for get to maximise my time and energy better, rendering a mutually beneficial partnership between employer and employee.Environmental impact of remote workOf all the things modern society has to contend with, the one thing we cannot deny is the impact of carbon emissions to our climate. With climate justice taking on an increasingly important role in how we shape society, it is important to recalibrate how we operate in our daily lives to mitigate the effects of climate change. A recent report from the Carbon Trust found that greater adoption of home working could save around 3 million tons of carbon emissions in the UK alone[1]. Because of our growing knowledge on the impact we have towards the natural environment, it is likely that organisations big and small will continue to push for remote working as a means to reduce our carbon footprint. In the US, the city of San Antonio, Texas is encouraging businesses to authorise more flexible working arrangements for employees such as getting them to work a four-day week (instead of five) to decrease their time on the road and improve the city's air quality. On the other hand, the Philippines has passed a recent law that allows employers in the private sector to offer remote working and promote people's capacity to earn without the need to exhaust their valuable resources and energy in commuting. These initiatives are mere examples of how institutional change are being enforced across multiple parts of the world to better accommodate the increasingly precarious state that our natural environment finds itself in. Not only is it important for governments to implement these solutions in the labor force framework, but it is becoming increasingly necessary. As such, we can realistically project that remote working as a solution to this problem will only take on a more prominent role as the decade unfolds. Not just as a trend, but as a norm, remote working coupled with tools and technologies is a viable and impactful solution to the pressing problems that come with climate change.Business continuity planning in times of crisisBusiness continuity planning (BCP) is the process of creating a system of prevention and recovery efforts from potential threats to a company. The plan ensures that personnel and assets are protected and are able to function quickly in the event of a disaster. These disasters can span from anything between situations of environmental calamity like typhoons, to less common predicaments like concerns surrounding health and other related issues. With global threats and health risks becoming more and more prominent, there is an acute awareness among big and small companies that preemptive measures and proactive systems must be in place in order to err on the side of caution. Such is the case in Singapore where, due to certain public health risks, many multinational companies are encouraging remote and flexible working arrangements[2] in order to better protect the their employees while still managing the daily grind that comes with operating a business Given these developments, business continuity planning is more important than ever as it helps strike a balance between securing the health and safety of employees while at the same time, making sure that the company gets to continue rendering products and services for its consumers. Remote working is a great way to circumvent these problems and equip companies with a formidable business continuity planning system. Given the right set of tools, a lot of businesses especially in the tech ecosystem will be able to function normally with the help of remote working despite certain public threats.The right set of toolsThere are many technologies out there that can help a company promote business continuity planning and provide ample tools for remote working. One of the greatest markers of a powerful tool when it comes to effective remote working is an integrated system that combines all conversations, documents, and meetings in one seamless platform. Because remote working means one's workforce is somewhat scattered and fragmented and often across multiple time zones, the best way for it to work is by streamlining and simplifying operations that can only be achieved in an effective integrated model. One of the best examples of these technologies is Lark, the new unified communications and collaborations solution for teams of all sizes. With tools such as messaging, calendar, video conferencing, and docs all synced in real-time and under one platform, Lark is a great example of a technology that can help one's business ease into a remote working environment. Not only that, but you can also install third-party tools into the platform that you may need in order to function as you would in an office-setting.

There is no \"penalty\" as such, but countries that do not keep their commitments will lose credibility and international standing, which may impact trade and diplomatic relations.</p><p> Some within this movement argue that Paris has failed on two counts. First, that even though the treaty aims to limit warming to under 2 deg C, with a view to further cap it under 1.5 deg C, it does not outline concrete or legally binding targets for countries to get there.</p><p>Britain-based magazine New Internationalist, in calling the Paris agreement an \"epic fail on a planetary scale\", pointed out that pledges made by countries, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, fall short of what is needed and is not consistent with the latest science. Critics also take issue with the fact that the deal requires no emission reductions from countries before 2020.</p><p> The second complaint, held particularly by civic groups in India, is the lack of mention of \"carbon space\" or carbon budget. These activists believe emission limits should be set for countries - less for developed nations, more for developing ones - so that the world remains within the safe limit of warming.</p><p> While both arguments have their merit, the reality is more complex.</p><p> The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997 with participation from 192 parties and which is in place till 2020, has demonstrated that legally binding targets are ineffective because enforcement is weak and countries (such as Canada) could simply drop out to avoid penalties. International UN treaties, where nations agree to a punitive framework, are simply no longer politically achievable.</p><p> Under the Paris agreement, targets are not binding, but countries are obliged to declare, communicate and maintain their targets. There is no \"penalty\" as such, but countries that do not keep their commitments will lose credibility and international standing, which may impact trade and diplomatic relations.</p><p> The desire to allocate specific emission limits to countries is not realistic either, because no politician will be able to get such a plan approved by its domestic citizens or Parliaments.</p><p> The next best approach is to have voluntary targets that are transparent and open to public scrutiny and pressure. This is exactly what the Paris agreement offers, with options to review these targets every five years and to ramp up cooperation in areas such as finance, forest protection and technology transfer.</p><p> More importantly, the Paris agreement is a big deal because it is a powerful show of global willingness to transition into a cleaner, more sustainable era. It sends a clear message - particularly to corporates - that the world has recognised climate change as a serious threat and has set out pathways to tackle it.</p><p> The fact is, we are - and climate justice is - better off with the Paris agreement than without it. Rather than slamming it, a more constructive response by the international community would be to encourage the process and mobilise governments and businesses to finance the infrastructure projects needed to achieve a low-carbon, more stable world.</p><p> Developing countries should view the agreement as an opportunity to embrace a path of development that leapfrogs existing inefficient and pollutive fossil fuel energy systems. Developed nations must honour their promise of providing the US$100 billion (S$141 billion) floor of financing each year to help developing countries get there.</p><p> Let's also not forget that this treaty is the hard-fought result of two decades of tough negotiations and that it went down to the wire. Speaking to reporters late on Dec 12 when the agreement was adopted, Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan shared that it was only in the wee hours of that morning that \"it all came together\", and that he \"wouldn't have taken it for granted\".</p><p> I was in Paris covering the talks and indeed, there were moments when I thought they might fail and we would leave empty-handed.</p><p> Tensions ran high on the last day, in anticipation of the final draft. After it was released, an angry activist from India denounced the agreement at a press conference, urging India's officials not to sign on to it. But as more reactions to the draft started to pour in, it became clear that the French presidency, thanks to masterful diplomacy, had managed to navigate countries into common \"landing zones\" so that everyone could accept the final agreement. Make no bones about it: Gaining consensus from 194 parties is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p> Even NGOs known for their tough demands gave their cautious approval. Friends of the Earth climate justice coordinator Lucy Cadena said the agreement \"marks a turning point for the balance of power\" , while Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said of the agreement that \"the human race has joined in a common cause\".</p><p> \"%5BIT%5D is only one step on a long road... but it is progress. This deal alone won't dig us out of the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep,\" he said.</p><p> Extreme activists who describe Paris as a failure ironically chip away at the potential of the deal to bring about the very outcomes they desire. A real Paris failure would be a repetition of what happened in Copenhagen at the same summit six years ago, which would have meant an irrevocable breakdown of trust between nations. Fortunately in Paris, it was the spirit of compromise and cooperation that prevailed.</p><p> \u00b7The writer is editor of Eco-Business, an Asia-Pacific sustainable business online publication.</p><p> \u00b7From January, this column will appear on the second Friday of each month.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["But some others have labelled it a total hogwash and \"epic failure\".

The United States and European Union would like some aspects of the document to be legally binding and, perhaps, in some way enforceable. But, then, that was what the 1997 Kyoto Treaty set out to do.

Their country sits next to the world's most intense typhoon generator, a huge expanse of deep, warm ocean in the North West Pacific.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> More than 20 tropical storms and typhoons buffet the islands each year. But even by Philippine standards, Super Typhoon Haiyan - or Yolanda as it is locally named - is a catastrophe of epic proportions. And the effect it has had on the country's people may have been significantly worsened by the Philippine government's siphoning of funds meant for infrastructure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Haiyan's winds were greater than either the 2005 Hurricane Katrina or Tropical Cyclone Yasi that hit North Queensland in 2011. They may have been the strongest winds ever recorded to make landfall.</p><p> In the worst hit areas, the super typhoon destroyed 70 to 80 per cent of the houses and structures in its path. One can only imagine how it treated the people sheltering inside.</p><p> One stranded resident told a journalist the hurricane aftermath resembled an apocalyptic horror film. It's estimated the human toll in one city alone will reach 10,000.</p><p> Haiyan is now considered the most destructive natural disaster ever in the country's history.</p><p> Few people realise the Philippine islands are home to almost 100 million people, making it the 12th most populated country in the world. The vast majority live in the regional provinces outside the highly urbanised capital of Metro Manila.</p><p> Still, little news is coming from the countryside of the central Philippines, the region which bore the brunt of the typhoon. Entire provinces have been cut off from the country's main power grid.</p><p> It's an eerie silence.</p><p> In the hours before the typhoon hit land, the President Benigno Aquino appeared on TV assuring the public his administration was making \"war-like\" preparations... cargo planes, helicopters, even 20 navy ships on standby. He had ordered officials, he said, to aim for zero casualties.</p><p> It's unlikely any preparation could have been sufficient to meet that goal. Nonetheless, what is estimated as an enormous loss of life - the full extent of which is still unknown - will demand answers in due course.</p><p> And when the time for such questions arrives, two political questions will no doubt loom large over this humanitarian crisis. Is this a natural disaster with an unnecessary human toll? And what is the role of climate change'</p><p> On the first: in a country where geography makes it one of the most dangerous places in the world to live, what is the role of government inaction in the tragedy'</p><p> The World Bank has previously pointed to the Philippines' government's failure to address the link between poverty and vulnerability to natural disasters. The country desperately needs investment in long-term preventive infrastructure, but the government seems committed only to a reactive approach.</p><p> It's not really about lack of money. Just as people suffer the effects of this killer typhoon further south, a political storm continues to unfold in Manila: a corruption scandal implicating members of the political elite, including President Aquino himself, who came to power in 2010 pledging to clean up patronage politics.</p><p> Conspicuously, allegations centre on the ransacking of two government funds designed to boost spending on infrastructure and poverty reduction. Money that should have gone to house vulnerable squatters and build flood protection in coastal communities has brazenly been funnelled away.</p><p> Far from being quiescent, ordinary Filipinos have had enough. In August, 100,000 people marched in Manila calling for the abolition of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (aptly renamed the \"pork barrel\" fund) which allows the President billions of pesos in discretionary (read, unaccountable) spending. No doubt, in the wake of Haiyan, these nation-wide protests will continue.</p><p> Second, the unprecedented intensity and destruction of Haiyan has already prompted political discussion at the international level. While it may have been branded by some as \"bad taste\" to politicise the recent bushfires in Australia with links to climate change, in the case of this Philippines environmental disaster things couldn't be more different.</p><p> On Monday, as news of the suffering to the south shocked the country, the Philippines Movement for Climate Justice mobilised a thousand people to march on the US Embassy in Manila, carrying banners that read \"US Dirty Energy means Our Disaster and Our Misery\".</p><p>Philippine protests about the link between killer storms and climate change have not been limited to the streets. A year ago the head of the Philippines delegation to the UN Climate Summit in Doha wept while addressing the plenary. Just days before, Typhoon Bopha had made its destructive way through the Southern Philippines, leaving over a thousand people dead, tens of thousands dislocated, and livelihoods destroyed. \"Madam chair,\" he said, \"we have never had a typhoon like Bopha, which has wreaked havoc in a part of the country that has never seen a storm like this in half a century.\"</p><p> Almost a year later to the day, with his country even more shaken by Typhoon Haiyan's human carnage, the same lead negotiator for the Philippines on Monday brought the opening session of the 2013 UN Climate Summit in Poland to its feet in a standing ovation, as he made his emotional plea on behalf of Typhoon Haiyan's victims:</p><p> \"What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness, the climate crisis is madness. We can stop this madness right here in Warsaw.\"</p><p> The unprecedented scale of Typhoon Haiyan was influenced by climate change, scientists have confirmed.
