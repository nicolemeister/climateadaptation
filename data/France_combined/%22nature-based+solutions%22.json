Or to put it another way, less than a sixth of what they are right now.</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>It's easy to grow complacent - cynical, even - about climate action at the political level.<br/></p><p><br/>Anyone who was at the COP29 climate conference in Baku last year - as I was - will have sensed the futility of governments wrangling over what seem like pennies, given what's at stake. Added to which the US, which had already ramped up oil and gas production to world record levels under the Biden administration, has pulled out of the Paris Agreement.<br/></p><p><br/>But without the luxury of oil and gas reserves, Europe is now asking if it can afford to replace gas from the east with gas from the leaky fracking fields of America. The proposed 2040 target implies a more profound choice: one between import dependency and missing the target, or accelerating the green transition.<br/></p><p><br/>Seventeen years after Europe's first emissions reduction target was set in law, the appetite for fossil fuels remains high, thanks to the failure to insulate homes, switch heat pumps for gas boilers, or halt the rise of emissions from road transport.<br/></p><p><br/>The scale of investment now needed is beyond any New Deal or Marshall Plan, or the bank bailouts that followed the 2008 financial crisis.<br/></p><p><br/>It took a war with real bullets for Europe's champion of frugality to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/german-parties-strike-deal-to-on-historic-debt-funded-investment-package/\">tear off its self-imposed fiscal straightjacket</url>. Will that logic - coupled with a pooling of European debt, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/eu-agrees-to-set-aside-37-of-recovery-fund-for-green-transition/\">has only ever happened</url> in the face of a global pandemic - be replicated to reach the 90% target?<br/></p><p><br/>The fossil fuel industry will have to back up its talk of \"blue\" hydrogen and sequestering billions of tonnes of CO2 underground with serious investment of its own. The greening of the financial system will have to be accelerated, and questions may have to be asked about the pursuit of shareholder value, boardroom bonuses and GDP growth.<br/></p><p><br/>There is, of course, a risk that progress will be hampered by entrenched political ideologies. For the populist right - and increasingly parties on the traditional conservative centre - positions against climate action are part of a hymn sheet that includes opposition to immigration, culture wars on issues like sexuality, and asserting motorists' right to monopolise city streets.<br/></p><p><br/>These issues need to be dealt with separately. Progress will also require greens and left-wingers to reach across the political divide - and perhaps ask themselves why they have lost much of their traditional voter base to the right.<br/></p><p><br/>Plenty of public and political figures in Europe still claim that climate change is - as Trump would have it - bullshit.

If journalists are to hold authorities to account, to what extent is this mission compromised by subsidies that allow them to carry out that task? And even if you don't depend on public funds, does this not make you beholden to commercial interests? Such questions could keep Brussels media circles animated until the cows come home.<br/></p><p><br/>Having spent most of my time in Brussels managing a small media outlet, I know the struggle of competing with far larger operations. Not everyone has the luxury of a multi-million-euro parent company backing them, and it's a tough war of attrition. For all the canny efforts small media use to attract an audience and deliver a fresh take on current affairs, it is disingenuous to overlook the structural advantages that big media enjoy. Should we not provide a helping hand to smaller initiatives in the name of media plurality?<br/></p><p><br/>And setting aside the question of how media manages to be commercially viable, subsidies are surely not the main barrier to critiquing our legislators. More problematic is the closeness of journalists and public officials, where friendliness is rewarded with insider access to valuable information. This pursuit of leaks is incentivised by the concentration of lobbies that cluster around the institutions.<br/></p><p><br/>These are issues most of us will be familiar with, though how we address them - and the tenor of that argument - depends largely on the stakes, which are inevitably personal.

In the end, Poland's image as Kyiv's staunchest ally has been badly dented.<br/></p><p><br/>Tusk's final remarks to the press at the end of a rather bland June summit - usually an opportunity for presidencies to take a victory lap and trumpet their achievements - were lacklustre. A meeting with the Polish national press the day after descended into a parochial affair, dominated by questions on domestic affairs and Tusk's barbs against his conservative opposition.<br/></p><p><br/>For months, Tusk's government held back from bold policy moves, blaming the looming presidential election - which they lost regardless. Having done precious little to actually shape EU policy, Poland now hands over the rotating presidency, leaving Tusk to face a brewing domestic storm.

But when national leaders are too distracted by domestic concerns, their European agendas are invariably hijacked.<br/></p><p><br/>Poland is not alone in this.<br/></p><p><br/>France, during its presidency in 2022, was similarly inward-looking, obsessing over its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/editors-take-rocky-start-as-french-presidency-turns-out-very-french/\">\"Frenchness\"</url> as meetings, documents and debates had to be conducted in French.

So cosy in fact that many, if not most, people here have convinced themselves (and one another) that it's perfectly acceptable, normal even, for the EU to directly fund the media that cover them.</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>'What's the big deal?' was the response in some quarters to Euractiv's revelation this week that the institution is spending <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/money-for-nothing-commission-pours-millions-into-struggling-eu-media/\">vastly more than previously acknowledged</url>:\u00a0(EURO)\u00a035 million per year on average.<br/><br/><br/>What's so shocking about this to anyone not born and bred in the \"Bubble\" is the double standard. How is it that the Commission, which is so proud of its efforts to 'level the playing field' when it comes to competition in European industry, has no qualms about manipulating the marketplace of ideas by not just subsidising, but in some cases creating, pliant media <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/tapping-the-eus-media-slush-fund-kallas-view-from-nowhere/\">staffed by journalistic neophytes</url><br/><br/><br/>In most European countries (with the glaring exception of France), using taxpayer money to bankroll the national press in perpetuity would be taboo - and for good reason.<br/><br/><br/>Imagine for a moment if Berlin were to write a generous cheque every year to help Der Spiegel maintain its political coverage. It would lose all credibility. And no, such payments are not analogous to national public broadcasters, which rely on license fees earmarked solely for them.<br/><br/><br/>In Brussels, generous subsidies for media have long been par for the course, as the shocking example of Euronews, which has received nearly\u00a0(EURO)250\u00a0million over the past decade, makes all too clear.<br/><br/><br/>That dependency has consequences, most disturbingly in that it has created a passive and obsequious press corps. Journalists in Brussels like to think of themselves as the 'fourth estate'. In reality, they often function more like a fifth column that works\u00a0hand in glove with the people they are supposed to cover in exchange for access.<br/><br/><br/>If that sounds like an exaggeration, consider the following exchange that transpired in a WhatsApp group this week between reporters who covered the Polish presidency and Poland's press team.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Thank you Wojciech, Magdalena, Katarzyna, Magdalena, Inga and the others that worked to inform the press in such a helpful and detailed way, day after day for the last six months. You have set a precedent, an example to follow for the future of the EU presidencies,\"</emphasis> gushed a correspondent for Italy's Askanews.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"I agree - you guys rocked,\" </emphasis>responded a writer for the EUObserver.<br/><br/><br/>Not to be outdone, a Bloomberg editor wrote: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"I'd like to propose a binding measure to keep the PL press team in the current form for at least a year or so, to continue keeping us informed  Then a well-deserved promotion. You guys rocked.\"</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>That triggered a virtual orgy of praise with dozens of 'journalists' - including reporters for Mlex, Politico and Reuters - piling in to pay fealty to the Polish flacks.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Denmark is freaking out rn,\" </emphasis>a Politico man interjected at one point (This week Denmark took over the presidency from Poland).\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Once the elation had ebbed, the Bloomberg editor signed off with: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"And they ended with dozens of reporters dancing to Love is in the Air.\"</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>So much for holding power to account.<br/><br/><br/>Such behaviour is symptomatic of a broken journalistic culture that encourages cheerleading and discourages critical voices. Even if the EU's press subsidies are not the only cause of this dysfunction, they have contributed to making journalists dependent on the politicians who control their economic fate and skewing the market for everyone else.<br/><br/><br/>There's a simple way for the EU to fix that: defund the media.<br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Roundup</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU budget breakdown - </emphasis>The Commission will present the bulk of its new budget proposal on 16 July, kicking off more than two years of difficult negotiations.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024.

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo.

The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024.

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal.

The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo.

Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 14, Source: Company Website, 179 words </p><p>July 31: Scor: Second quarter 2025 results</p><p>SCOR SE's Board of Directors met on 30 July 2025, under the chairmanship of Fabrice Bregier, to approve the Group's Q2 2025 financial statements.</p><p>Thierry Leger, Chief Executive Officer of SCOR, comments: \"After a strong first quarter, all our business activities continue to perform well, contributing to a Group net income of EUR 226 million in the second quarter of 2025. The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date. I remain confident for the rest of the year and in SCOR's ability to execute the Forward 2026 strategic plan.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 14, Source: Company Website, 127 words </p><p>July 17: SCOR releases its 2024 Sustainable Business Report</p><p>SCOR has released its 2024 Sustainable Business Report, complementing the information set out in the Sustainability Statement of the Group's 2024 Universal Registration Document (Section 6, page 285).

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words</p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 14, Source: Company Website, 179 words </p><p>July 31: Scor: Second quarter 2025 results</p><p>SCOR SE's Board of Directors met on 30 July 2025, under the chairmanship of Fabrice Bregier, to approve the Group's Q2 2025 financial statements.</p><p>Thierry Leger, Chief Executive Officer of SCOR, comments: \"After a strong first quarter, all our business activities continue to perform well, contributing to a Group net income of EUR 226 million in the second quarter of 2025. The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event."]}, {"relevance_score": 320, "title": "Scor (SCR: EUR28.42) - PRE-MARKET CONFIRMATORY BULLISH SIGNAL FROM ITS ADR MARKET Tuesday August 05, 2025 06:08 CEST", "published": "2025-08-05", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 1  PRE-MARKET CUES FROM ITS ADR TRADING: (SCOR) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STOCKS RISING ON HIGH RELATIVE STRENGTH</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ADR Daily: Societe Commerciale de Reassurance (SCOR) ADR (SCRYY: US$3.29) lifts 1.2%, outperforming 89% of the market</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Societe Commerciale de Reassurance (SCOR) ADR (OT: SCRYY US$3.29) lifted 4.0c (1.2%) from its previous trading session to close at US$3.29.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Compared with the BNY Mellon Composite ADR Index which rose 2.4 points (1.2%) in the day, the relative price increase was 0.05%.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the International Depository Receipts market of 1,063 units traded today, the ADR has a 6-month relative price strength of 89 indicating it has outperformed 89% of the market.

The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect.

The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024.

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo.

Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 11, Source: Company Website, 243 words </p><p>July 02: Enhancing the Underwriting Process with SCOR's AI Assistant</p><p>One of SCOR's strategic objectives under the Forward 2026 plan is to be future-ready, and digital transformation is playing a key role in helping us to achieve this. We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words </p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event."]}, {"relevance_score": 55, "title": "Empowering the Next Generation: Nature-Based Solutions Education [Promoted content]", "published": "2023-06-02", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the face of glaring evidence for stepping up actions against climate change for our future generations, learning for sustainability is still in its infancy.

This unique technology enables the production of renewable hydrogen at a substantially lower cost compared to conventional methods, while offering an unparalleled carbon footprint.</p><p>Achieving the continuous production of competitive green hydrogen is a decisive step. Currently, the industry faces significant delays due to the excessive cost of decarbonized hydrogen. We are confident that our solution will accelerate the adoption of renewable hydrogen and enhance the sectors competitiveness. I want to congratulate the Haffner Energy team and our partners for this remarkable achievement, ushering the company into a new era, stated Philippe Haffner, Co-founder and CEO of Haffner Energy.</p><p>A Flexible and Economically Advantageous Production Model</p><p>The sites production capacity will be 15 kg of hydrogen per hour (kg/h), with an initial phase temporarily limited to 11 kg/h due to the existing PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) purification equipment. This equipment will be replaced in the coming months by a PSA designed to reach a 15 kg/h capacity. The unit already produces hydrogen at 8 bar pressure, ready for commercial distribution starting in the second half of 2025 to serve transportation and industrial markets.</p><p>Anticipated since late 2024, this commissioning required the site to be connected to the medium-voltage electrical grid, which was completed earlier this year, followed by the on-site presence of commissioning engineers focused on the main equipment suppliers for hydrogen purification.</p><p>The biomass thermolysis unit, operational since June 2024, exceeds the capacity required to produce 15 kg/h of hydrogen.</p><p>Press Release article 8 of 14, Source: West Corporation, 339 words </p><p>February 20: Haffner Energy and ATOBA Energy collaborate to unlock the SAF value chain and scale the market</p><p>This strategic partnership secures long-term offtake agreements, unlocking financing and accelerating the scale-up of SAF production. </p><p>Vitry-le-Francois, France / Lyon, France (February 20, 2025, 6:00pm CEST)</p><p>Haffner Energy, a leading solid biomass-to-clean fuels solutions provider, and ATOBA Energy, a SAF aggregator committed to unlocking the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) value chain by solving the financial dilemma between producers and final offtakers, are joining forces to accelerate the development of SAF projects and facilitate their financing, they announced today.</p><p>France-based Haffner Energy relies on its 31-year experience to design, manufacture, supply, license, and operate proprietary disruptive clean fuels solutions, including critical technology for SAF production, using all types of biomass residues wet or dry, such as agricultural and municipal waste. The company has already announced the development of a couple of SAF projects, notably Paris-Vatry SAF in France, where full scale production is expected to be reached by 2030 when the next stage of the European SAF mandate kicks in. Partnering with SAF aggregator ATOBA will significantly enhance SAF offtake then.</p><p>We are particularly excited about this partnership with ATOBA, as it will facilitate the financing of our SAF projects, starting with Paris-Vatry. One of the most crucial challenges in securing financing for SAF production facilities is the ability to obtain offtake contracts that guarantee the purchase of SAF at a stable, price for periods exceeding five years. The key advantage provided by ATOBA is that it offers this guarantee while significantly reducing risks and commitments for airline clients. This will facilitate and accelerate their engagement in SAF procurement. As such, it is a win-win model for all stakeholders and we are extremely pleased that ATOBA has identified us as a strategic and unique player in the SAF ecosystem, said Haffner Energy co-founder and CEO Philippe Haffner.</p><p>Indeed, the SAF market is facing challenges in expanding at the rate demanded by environmental needs and regulatory mandates.</p><p>Press Release article 9 of 14, Source: West Corporation, 264 words </p><p>January 28: Haffner Energy, LanzaJet, and LanzaTech join forces to unlock Alcohol-To-Jet SAF production from biomass residues</p><p>Vitry-le-Francois, France / Chicago, USA (January 28, 2025, 8:00am CEST / 1:00am CT)</p><p>Haffner Energy, a leading advanced solid biomass-to-clean fuels solutions provider, LanzaTech, a carbon management company providing a differentiated syngas-to-ethanol solution, and LanzaJet, the leading ethanol-to-jet technology company and fuels producer, announce today they are working together to explore joint biomass-to-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) projects covering the entire production value chain.</p><p>The three companies are exploring SAF production opportunities, including the development of commercial plants, joint technology licenses, and offtake opportunities as they become available, and funding support and/or investment in specific SAF projects.</p><p>The three companies together demonstrate the type of partnership and technology alignment this industry will need to be successful in meeting the global demands of aviation, says LanzaJet CEO Jimmy Samartzis.

The contribution of such crops to decarbonization is going to be significant. Haffner Energy has developed an innovative, patented biomass and organic waste thermolysis technology, backed by 30 years of experience. This technology produces renewable hydrogen and clean fuels for industry and mobility applications. In addition, it generates biocarbon (char or biochar), a natural carbon sink, and biogenic CO2. Bambbco is a nature-based solutions company that uses several species of bamboo to produce renewable energy, sequester carbon, prevent soil erosion, re-establish the water cycle, promote biodiversity, and contribute to the biomass-to-energy circular economy. Bambbco is a laureate of Frances start-up booster program French Tech. Bamboo produces up to four times as much biomass, as wood residues from a forest in standard conditions. In addition, bamboo displays remarkable characteristics such as being drought tolerant, requiring no chemical inputs, and capturing heavy metals and toxic chemical elements through its roots system.

Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 11, Source: Company Website, 243 words </p><p>July 02: Enhancing the Underwriting Process with SCOR's AI Assistant</p><p>One of SCOR's strategic objectives under the Forward 2026 plan is to be future-ready, and digital transformation is playing a key role in helping us to achieve this. We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words </p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo.

ESG</p><p>2.1 September 07 2023: ScorSCOR launches its new strategic plan: Forward 2026</p><p>Press Release</p><p>7 September 2023 - N 17</p><p>SCOR launches its new strategic plan</p><p>Forward 2026</p><p>Driving value creation. Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 3 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>3.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 11, Source: Company Website, 243 words </p><p>July 02: Enhancing the Underwriting Process with SCOR's AI Assistant</p><p>One of SCOR's strategic objectives under the Forward 2026 plan is to be future-ready, and digital transformation is playing a key role in helping us to achieve this. We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words </p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility. Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet. Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event."]}, {"relevance_score": 16, "title": "France's new climate adaptation plan prepares for +4\u00b0C in 2100", "published": "2025-03-10", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">France's new plan to adapt to climate change's most dire consequences outlines 52 measures to prepare the country for a climate 4\u00b0C warmer than in pre-industrial times by 2100.</emphasis></p><p>The national fund to prevent major natural risks, known as 'fonds Barnier', is increased by 30%, to (EURO)300 million a year, under the plan published on Monday.</p><p>Climate change adaptation will benefit from \"unprecedented resources,\" the France ecological transition minister Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher said at the press conference in which she presented the plan.</p><p>She announced that France's water management agencies will \"will be mobilizing nearly (EURO)1 billion for adaptation, including almost 40% to support nature-based solutions.\"</p><p>France's green fund, which helps local governments and administrators in the green transition, will see (EURO)260 million dedicated to climate change adaptation, the minister added.</p><p>Without action, the costs of climate change damages in could double in the next 30 years, she said.</p><p>\"Our lives, our habits, our landscapes, our homes and our jobs are all threatened by the growing impact of climate change.\"</p><p>\"Faced with this situation, I refuse to accept fatalism.

COP30 is not just another conference, it's an opportunity for a new axis of leadership to emerge. This is why we're calling on the Global South, led by Brazil and supported by committed partners like the EU, to seize this opportunity to lead and shape a strong agenda for the coming decades.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Global South's turn to lead</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>The world cannot afford another lost year of negotiations. COP29 exposed the dangers of disunity and geopolitical tensions, and these issues must not be repeated this year. This is why Brazil, alongside partners like Indonesia, Egypt, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Kenya, and others across the Global South, must step forward with initiative and lead the way.<br/></p><p><br/>Global climate policy, like so many other issues, has often been shaped through a Northern lens. COP30 offers a chance for a different story.<br/></p><p><br/>It's an opportunity to move from reactive participation to proactive leadership. The summit can be a success, if a coherent and focused agenda is set early on. Climate is not its own, siloed issue. It's integrated across trade, finance, industry, and every other sector, and therefore its policy should be integrated as well. Baku showed us the risks of a fragmented and incohesive narrative, and therefore the Global South must ensure a bold yet coherent agenda that will lead to concrete action in key areas.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rethinking climate alliances</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>But the Global South is not alone.<br/></p><p><br/>The EU should play a significant role supporting the efforts of the South, but must change its global view. There is no longer a need to default to US leadership - there can be an alternative transatlantic alliance.<br/></p><p><br/>This also requires an updated perspective on collaboration. Trade negotiations like the EU-Mercosur deal can serve as a model for climate cooperation, if managed holistically and equitably. The agreement shows the potential of the EU-South partnership, but also the pitfalls of compartmentalised negotiations.<br/></p><p><br/>As mentioned above, climate is not a singular issue that can be negotiated as such. Climate, trade, investment and technology must be aligned at a macro level, negotiated in tandem. Europe cannot cherry-pick areas of engagement and should be open to link key policies, such as the EU ETS, with emerging compliance carbon markets in the world.<br/></p><p><br/>To go further, there should also be a push for more domestic policy coherence from all sides. The EU and the Global South must lead by example at home. Greater alignment reinforces trust and reaffirms credibility. For success at the global level, policy compatibility is essential. Commissioner Hoekstra, this is your chance to show the EU is truly committed to the global climate cause, beyond the $1.3 trillion funding figure that hijacked Baku's tedious meeting.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COP30 and beyond</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>This year's summit will take place in Bel\u00e9m, deep in the heart of the Amazon, bringing the fragility and significance of nature to the centre of attention. But this is more than just symbolic. As leaders gather on the edge of the world's largest rainforest, the planet's ecosystems must move from the margins to the core of climate negotiations.<br/></p><p><br/>This must be the moment we move from rhetoric to delivery. A successful COP30 requires more than declarations, it demands a clear, actionable agenda and shared accountability. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) must become more than technical exercises; they should serve as national investment strategies, guiding the next phase of climate policy and economic planning.<br/></p><p><br/>More concrete projects between the Global South and Global North are needed - Article 6 progress is a positive signal, but we need to build on that to accelerate the pace and trigger the full potential of voluntary carbon markets bilaterally and multilaterally.<br/></p><p><br/>But not all countries can do this alone. Many in the Global South will need targeted support to design, implement, and finance these plans. It's in the collective interest of global partners, especially the EU, to help make this possible.<br/></p><p><br/>The private sector and regional development banks must also step up. Businesses cannot wait on regulatory and geopolitical certainty to begin acting.

What does success look like? What breakthroughs are needed on climate finance, loss and damage, nature, and transition pathways?

Such a budget could help ensure the responsible use of finite removal resources, prioritising them for emissions that are hardest to eliminate."]}, {"relevance_score": 39, "title": "'Survival of the fittest' critical for nature-based solutions to climate, argue entrepreneurs from Brilliant Planet and United Renewables", "published": "2022-08-26", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nature-based solutions for climate change that are created 'artificially' have been 'fraught with failure,' because of a reliance on complex and synthetic scientific methods, claims Riccardo Gubbioli, Director of Corporate Finance at carbon capture and storage (CCS) scale-up Brilliant Planet</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DOUGLAS, Isle of Man, Aug. 26, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Instead, the sector needs to embrace more natural and holistic methods to sustainably contribute to net-zero in the future, as CCS technologies come back into focus with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The cost of complexity</emphasis></p><p>Gubbioli issued this call to rethink organic CCS technologies whilst in conversation with<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=A-dI1B7ZVp6mubWgEiyDCjLgao-n1GWF44bhUovsoSMy5Zh8O9g0sbwMyWlggnsqvEEVW3pYP59IPt7JlmDvTp6_Pivhw24Qh2c07oUBZcMgNnahQgse5Rpz6ld3WAGAR73S_Fek93fJBfwywnY35A17SRBsMGMCiKiadmpBv7A=\">Chris Caldwell</url>, entrepreneur and founder of clean-energy firm United Renewables, on an episode of the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BfPPYiDIKHpgUU9NeQLIIrP-3H8l8cY1Xc51YdMdT7C06EkA1vVuNNdjoQ27F8GTxg2CWJ3UURxyndhfGqztKaPF4bKrIJ_cseuNBlm3JIpj1Y2veuWG5tFxycXdEW4R2xneQPHCqFj2_6bJdsplGA==\">Conversations in Climate</url>podcast released today.</p><p>Discussing the original boom-and-bust in nature-based solutions such as biofuels in the mid-2000's, Caldwell asked why the world hasn't 'gone back' to the same technologies with more investment in recent years.</p><p>Gubbioli answered by stressing the impact of 'high profile deaths' - such as green-oil microalgae firm Sapphire Energy - which scared investors away from these firms and technologies.

This enables them to support biodiversity, provide climate change resilience, adaptation and mitigation benefits, support for Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and health benefits to people and wildlife. For example protecting the last remaining tracts of forest ecosystems still high in ecological integrity protects biodiversity and reduces desertification while delivering multiple benefits for the climate, societies, and economies. Consider the vast remaining tracts of tropical forest across Central Africa. These provide habitat for critically endangered gorillas and forest elephants, whilst also providing essential services for wellbeing of our planet in the form of climate and water regulation."]}, {"relevance_score": 27, "title": "Innovate and maximise forest potential to fight food and climate challenges, says FAO [Advocacy Lab Content]", "published": "2024-09-30", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Innovation is essential for maximising the potential of forests and addressing global challenges while paving the way towards a sustainable future for the forestry sector, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.</emphasis><br/><br/>In its <url normalizedValue=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/722e0c62-cd6e-47dd-8cc2-976a854d577c/content/cd1211en.html#gsc.tab=0\">report</url>, \"The State of the World's Forests 2024: Forest-sector innovations towards a more sustainable future\", FAO explores ways to scale up forest conservation, restoration and sustainable use through innovation.<br/><br/>Although some countries have made significant progress in reducing deforestation - Indonesia by 8.4 per cent and Brazil's Legal Amazon by 50 per cent - climate change is increasing the vulnerability of forests to threats such as wildfires and pests.</p><p><br/><br/>The report highlights the rising intensity and frequency of wildfires, even in previously unaffected areas, releasing an estimated 6,687 megatonnes of carbon dioxide globally, whereas boreal fires have also reached a new high.<br/><br/>Extended droughts are worsening fire severity and fuel consumption, accounting for nearly a quarter of total wildfire emissions, according to the report.<br/><br/>In addition to fires, invasive species, including insects, pests, and disease pathogens, are also endangering tree growth and their survival.

Liege DeclarationWith memories still fresh of the deadly floods that killed 39 people in Wallonia in summer 2021, it's no surprise that the Li\u00e8ge Declaration on Adaptation to Climate Change, signed in early February by European networks and organisations of non-state actors - including businesses, researchers, civil society and local government - highlighted adaptation to climate change through nature-based solutions (NbS) and resilience as the number one priority. According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), 50% of all species in the EU rely upon agricultural habitats. It is therefore essential to have farmers' buy-in to implementing nature-based solutions. Agriculture relies on biodiversity. Food and fibre production depend on various genetic or natural factors such as soil and water conservation, soil fertility, pest and disease resistance, and pollination.

National restoration plansThe ELO therefore supports the European Commission's proposed Nature Restoration Law that would require EU countries to develop national restoration plans. These plans should define the restoration measures to meet binding targets up to 2050.", "Yafai added: \"This should include a focus on more innovative finance models, from incentives and blended finance models, through to addressing harmful public subsidies; including in reviewing and reforming key aspects of the EU CAP that aren't helping to defend farmers from the worst effects of climate change to come. The business case for those incentives seems self-evident. The European Central Bank has said: \"The loss of biodiversity and the degradation of natural ecosystems pose a significant threat to the broader economy and financial stability. Its report found that \"nearly three-quarters of all bank loans in the euro area are to companies that are highly dependent on biodiversity. Increasingly there are sectors - particularly renewables - that understand that the way to green and prosperous growth in the EU, is in getting these biodiversity policies implemented well and financed well. In the context of climate change mitigation, there are huge win-wins as nature-based solutions can help mitigate climate change emissions in a cost-effective way. Planting a tree, or restoring a riverbank is in many cases far cheaper than technological solutions. In short, nature is part of the toolkit to help protect agricultural communities, rural SMEs, farmers, etc. Businesses themselves understand this. Now politicians must get on board,\" concluded Yafai.

Carbon Streaming will receive 13.5% of total credits, which is expected to be approximately 438,000 carbon credits through 2052. \u00a0Closing of the Azuero Reforestation Stream is subject to customary conditions with closing expected to occur by the end of Q2 2024.The Project is the first streaming agreement where a majority of the carbon credits Carbon Streaming will receive are pre-contracted through an offtake agreement at closing, an investment model that the Company expects to replicate in the future. Carbon Streaming has also entered into a marketing agreement with ARC, pursuant to which Carbon Streaming has been appointed as sole marketer of ARC's carbon credits for the life of the Project, other than those already committed to the co-investors in the Azuero Reforestation Stream. The expected IRR from the Project is consistent with Carbon Streaming's target IRR for other investments, and the addition of a long-term carbon credit offtake partner in Microsoft has significantly de-risked cash flows.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Carbon Streaming</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-fy42yptXxnndm92ey878C_98G1gtM0Dzet3vj5Flun5LccwcCFGsU2te6M9FIyrVzIioTfAm3d6xMd7faT1rU3KIz0D-Uh2vTq-SbLKaAQ=\">Carbon Streaming</url>aims to accelerate a net-zero future.

The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/electricity/news/the-letta-report-whats-in-the-box-for-europes-energy-sector/\">Letta Report</url> echoed these points, and the forthcoming <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/draghi-eu-must-enact-radical-change-as-us-and-china-refuse-to-play-by-the-rules/\">Draghi Report</url> is expected to do the same.</p><p>It's election time, so these interventions are largely political slogans. But even after five years, it's not clear that Europe has managed to translate political slogans into a coherent policy framework.\u00a0</p><p>A key element, the Net Zero Industry Act, which was passed by Parliament last week, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/europes-net-zero-industry-law-will-do-little-for-manufacturing-ambitions-experts-say/\">considered by many to be toothless</url>.\u00a0</p><p>At the time of the Act's conception, an accompanying 'Sovereignty Fund' was also planned, to back up the new rules with serious cash.\u00a0</p><p>However Europe's subsequent fumbling on funding shows the existential challenge that industrial policy poses to the EU.</p><p>No fresh money materialised, thanks to deep scepticism from several national governments.\u00a0</p><p>In the meantime the Commission relaxed State Aid rules.

To preserve the Single Market - the EU's crown jewel -\u00a0 any industrial strategy funding would need to be decided in Brussels.\u00a0</p><p>But this implies a bigger EU budget, more transfers between countries and - probably - common EU debt as a structural solution.\u00a0Delivering this would mean crossing one of Europe's deepest faultlines.

It notes that early investment is much more cost-effective than later investment, and that prioritization is the best way to focus spending. This means that countries should focus financing on more risk-exposed areas or assets that may be vulnerable to disaster impacts and put people in danger or cause major disruptions, such as ageing infrastructure or critical networks.</p><p>The report notes that more research and data are needed on where those vulnerabilities are and what kinds of costs would be involved in remedying the situation. It suggests that countries develop climate \"adaptation pathways\" that set the direction of travel, combining current and future climate risk data.</p><p>Given current information, the report estimates that the cost of climate adaptation will vary between (EURO)34 to (EURO)110 per person per year, depending on where they live. Total adaptation costs in the European Union up to the 2030s could be between (EURO)15 billion to (EURO)64 billion annually - suggesting a necessary scale of adaptation finance between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent of EU GDP.</p><p>\"Adaptation pathways combine the needs and priorities across all economic and administrative sectors,\" explains Solene Dengler, a senior climate change adaptation specialist with the World Bank who worked on the report.</p><p>\"This means countries need to carry out more and better studies both at national and sectoral levels to identify adaptation gaps, costs, and benefits of adaptation measures and track adaptation expenditures and implementation,\" said Dengler.</p><p>The report concludes several specific case studies such as wildfires and extreme heat in Bulgaria, floods impact transport in Romania, and wildfire prevention in the forestry sector in Sweden.</p><p>But for costs to be correctly estimated so governments can steer financing in the right direction, better data is needed.</p><p>\"There is a lack of information on projected impacts of climate risks for the short to medium term from the 2030s to the 2050s), especially to inform sectoral or investment portfolio assessments,\" says Dengler.</p><p>She remarked: \"Strengthening a country's financial resilience will also require improved macroeconomic modelling that can better capture extreme impacts and take into account adjusted macroeconomic impacts when policymakers are considering a package of adaptation measures. At the EU level, the recent European Climate Risk Assessment and this report are important contributions to this evolving knowledge base.\"</p><p>In the end, neither climate change adaptation nor climate change mitigation strategies should distract from the other, she said, \"Climate change adaptation is complementary to climate change mitigation. Acting on both is economically beneficial, can reduce direct losses from disaster and climate impacts and have broader social and environmental benefits.\"</p><p>The report concludes that a major scale-up of public, private, and blended finance will be necessary and investment planning and financial strategies are not yet adequately informed by an understanding of the costs of climate change adaptation at national and EU levels.</p><p>One area of concern is that too much of the disaster and climate risk is managed through budgetary instruments at the EU level and by EU Member States, with gaps concerning pre-arranged funds and the use of risk transfer mechanisms, such as risk insurance.</p><p>Response operations to wildfires account for approximately one-third of total response costs in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/topics/civil-protection-mechanism/\">European Union Civil Protection Mechanism</url> budget. But if the EU experienced wildfires this year similar to the extremes of the 2017 season, there would need to be a 70 per cent increase in the annual budget. This, the report concludes, shows that not enough planning has gone into matching financing needs with disaster potential based on previous experience.</p><p>\"The major takeaway is that the EU's substantial climate risks require system-wide transformational adaptation, which includes reforming institutions, legal frameworks, and sectoral strategies,\" said Dengler, adding: \"A piecemeal approach is no longer enough. Adaptation measures must be mainstreamed and coordinated across sectors and ministries, including in planning, fiscal, and sectoral strategies.\"</p><p>[By Dave Keating\u00a0I Edited by Brian Maguire | <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["But this isn't to say that Europe's lawmakers aren't doing anything.

Holistic landscape restoration has more than just ecological benefits - by bringing people together to restore their landscape, it can build social cohesion and capital among and between communities, as well as serving as the backbone of thriving local and regional economies. By producing benefits for multiple sectors and stakeholder groups, holistic landscape restoration can contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future in line with the EU Green Deal's vision.</p><p>Through Landscape Finance, policymakers could catalyse transformative change via holistic landscape restoration, making lasting impact on Europe's landscapes.\u00a0Here are some recommendations for how EU policymakers can integrate a Landscape Finance approach into their work:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. LANDSCAPES AND LANDSCAPE PARTNERSHIPS NEED TO BE RECOGNISED IN POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE AND TO MEET MULTIPLE TARGETS\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU institutions and member states should allocate resources to support landscape partnerships that drive holistic landscape restoration</emphasis>. Public funds in the form of unrestricted and flexible grant funding should be made available to support multi- stakeholder landscape partnership and governance processes to catalyse restoration. This is the most catalytic of all funding opportunities within holistic landscape restoration as the partnership develops the vision and plan for the landscape, providing governance and driving long- term restoration.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Implement incentives that are aligned to nature</emphasis>. It is critical to redirect or eliminate environmentally harmful incentives, such as subsidies, on behalf of activities that restore ecosystems and enhance ecosystem services. Accelerating the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and applying the reform with integrity will be instrumental in aligning nature and agricultural biodiversity objectives and finance. By aligning policies to reward benefits appropriately and financially penalise harms, governments can encourage nature-positive actions and discourage harmful ones.\u00a0</p><p>Holistic landscape restoration can serve as an enabling platform to streamline implementation of national plans targeting the same landscape. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National and regional development plans (including National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans) of EU member states should recognise landscapes and landscape partnerships</emphasis>, facilitating vertical and horizontal policy coherence and integration of national spatial planning and budgeting across sectors. This should be done to best suit the policy and fiscal systems of each country. However, regardless of each country's level of decentralised decision-making, landscapes can be leveraged to implement adaptation, nature restoration and drought plans, among other policies.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should develop harmonised accounting and reporting frameworks for landscapes </emphasis>that enable the private sector (companies and investors) to report against emerging sustainable finance regulations such as the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. PUBLIC FINANCE CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL, CATALYTIC ROLE IN HOLISTIC LANDSCAPE RESTORATION\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All guidance documentation for the Nature Restoration Law developed by the European Commission should explicitly recognise the value of landscapes in tackling multiple goals and be translated in national restoration plans</emphasis>. By fostering cross-sectoral collaboration among government agencies, NGOs, businesses and local communities at landscape level, diverse interests can be aligned, and resources pooled, to implement strategies that tackle multiple challenges in a cost-efficient and effective way.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should produce a guidance document on how to incorporate landscape restoration into national restoration plans</emphasis>.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should develop a mechanism with the mandate to provide earmarked funding for landscapes</emphasis>. Within the current multiannual financing framework (MFF), Directorates-General that will benefit from restoration (CLIMA, ENV, AGRI, EMPL, REGIO, SANTE, etc.) should earmark portions of their budgets for landscape restoration. These earmarked budget elements could be put under one governance system, a dedicated restoration fund. Equally, dedicated financial support should be considered in the new MFF (2028-2034). This could be done through a funding programme similar to the European Innovation Council Accelerator, targeted towards attracting private finance to holistic landscape restoration activities and processes - for example, by providing guarantees to de-risk investments, or by providing subordinated funding as part of a blended-finance approach. The European Investment Bank could provide advisory support to such a vehicle and/or provide co- investment.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. WITHIN HOLISTIC LANDSCAPE RESTORATION, INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS SHOULD ADOPT A LONG-TERM HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE, INCORPORATING RESTORATION OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENHANCE CLIMATE RESILIENCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU institutions and member states should provide public funding for landscape restoration initiatives to enable the integration of grey infrastructure projects with improvements in associated green infrastructure</emphasis>. Taking a holistic approach to these investments at landscape level will be more cost-effective, and it will improve the resilience of the total investment to the physical risks of climate change while generating multiple valuable public benefits. Large scale landscape restoration projects should get similar financial support and attention as large grey infrastructure projects.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We need Landscape Finance more than ever</emphasis></p><p>As farmers protests crank up a notch and EU officials threaten to dial back Green Deal measures, the question of how to achieve the EU Green Deal's vision has never been more pressing. More than ever, we need new financing frameworks like Landscape Finance to support nature restoration as well as help farmers to transition to more regenerative practices at landscape scale.

By producing benefits for multiple sectors and stakeholder groups, holistic landscape restoration can contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future in line with the EU Green Deal's vision."]}, {"relevance_score": 498, "title": "Societe Generale: Second quarter 2024 earnings", "published": "2024-08-01", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RESULTS AT 30 JUNE 2024</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Press release</emphasis>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paris, 1 August 2024</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUARTERLY RESULTS</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quarterly revenues of EUR 6.7 billion</emphasis>, up by +6.3% vs. Q2 23, driven by an excellent quarter for Global Markets and Transaction Banking, increased margins at Ayvens and NII recovery underway in France despite facing headwinds from deposit beta and a slower loan origination in a muted environment</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Positive jaws</emphasis>, tight grasp on operating expenses, up by +2.9% vs. Q2 23 and by +0.7%* at constant perimeter and exchange rates</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cost-to-income ratio at 68.4% in Q2 24</emphasis>, improving by 2.2 percentage points vs. Q2 23 and 6.5 percentage points vs Q1 24<sup>1</sup></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cost of risk at 26 basis points in Q2 24</emphasis>, stock of provisions on performing loans of EUR 3.2 billion</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Group net income of EUR 1.1 billion</emphasis>, up +24% vs. Q2 23</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Profitability (ROTE) at 7.4%</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIRST HALF 2024 RESULTS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Half-year revenues of EUR 13.3 billion</emphasis>, up +2.9% vs. H1 23</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Positive jaws</emphasis>, operating expenses slightly up by +0.6% vs. H1 23, down by -3.2%* at constant perimeter and exchange rates</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cost-to-income ratio at 71.6% in H1 24</emphasis>, improving by 1.7 percentage points vs. S1 23<sup>1</sup></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Profitability (ROTE) at 5.8%</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLID CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CET1 ratio at 13.1%</emphasis><sup>2</sup><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">at end of Q2 24</emphasis>, around 285 basis points above the regulatory requirement, and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected to be above 13% at end-2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liquidity Coverage Ratio at 152% at end-Q2 24</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Provision for distribution of EUR 0.91</emphasis><sup>3</sup><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">per share,</emphasis>at end-June 2024</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Completion of the 2023 share buy-back programme</emphasis>of around EUR 280 million</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Slawomir Krupa, the Group's Chief Executive Officer, commented</emphasis>:\"In the second quarter, our commercial and financial performance is significantly improving, in line with our 2024 targets and our 2026 roadmap.

Growth in revenues, combined with our disciplined costs and risks management, allows us to significantly improve our cost-to-income ratio and profitability. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain very strong. We continue to move forward in an orderly and efficient manner with the implementation of our strategic roadmap, as demonstrated in the sustained development of BoursoBank which is exceeding the 6.5 million clients threshold, and as shown by the launch of the first phase of our 1 billion euros investment dedicated to the energy transition.

Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan.</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We have made good progress against our climate targets:</p><p>By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity - significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the third consecutive year we hit our target.</p><p>As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A]</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business.

This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%.</p><p>We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Driving towards a net-zero future</emphasis></p><p>We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition.

Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the\u00a0energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future.</p><p>Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for\u00a0many years with oil, gas and LNG.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to\u00a0build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technologies of the future</emphasis></p><p>We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too.</p><p>I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to\u00a0produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value with less emissions</emphasis></p><p>At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to\u00a0our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and shareholder support</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I\u00a0appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to\u00a0our\u00a0next engagement in April 2024.</p><p>The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update.</p><p>This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at\u00a0our\u00a0Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board\u00a0and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sir Andrew Mackenzie</emphasis></p><p>Chair</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Executive Officer's introduction</emphasis></p><p>This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we\u00a0published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our\u00a0progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for\u00a0energy will only grow.</p><p>At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero.</p><p>I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in\u00a0the direction of our strategy.</p><p>Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the\u00a0world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to\u00a0use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to\u00a0provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Progress towards our targets</emphasis></p><p>Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with\u00a0renewable energy.</p><p>We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of\u00a0methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of\u00a0the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value, less emissions</emphasis></p><p>At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In\u00a0this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the\u00a0same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In\u00a0Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as\u00a0biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future.</p><p>Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on\u00a0delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing emissions from production</emphasis></p><p>We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen.</p><p>We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It\u00a0continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as\u00a0wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by\u00a0replacing coal.</p><p>In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to\u00a0lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint\u00a0venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by\u00a0more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities.</p><p>The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around\u00a080% less carbon dioxide emissions over its</p><p>operating\u00a0life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting our customers as they decarbonise</emphasis></p><p>We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have\u00a0competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and\u00a0identify clear regulatory support from governments. The\u00a0transport sector is a good example.</p><p>We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to\u00a0help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in\u00a0biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to\u00a0focus on four regional energy\u00a0and chemicals parks, we are\u00a0creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future.</p><p>As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a\u00a0new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most\u00a0progressive in the world.</p><p>Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is\u00a0selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to\u00a0retail customers. As a result, we\u00a0expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our\u00a0net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis></p><p>In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices\u00a0for our customers.</p><p>Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into\u00a0a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are\u00a0the investment case and the partner of choice through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wael Sawan</emphasis></p><p>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions.</emphasis></p><p>1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%.</p><p>5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly.</p><p>6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year.</p><p>7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]</p><p>Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.</p><p>8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge.</p><p>9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p>10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our journey towards net zero</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023</emphasis></p><p>Invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions, of our total capital spending of $24.4 billion in 2023. This included the acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe.Our Timi platform in Malaysia, mainly powered by solar and wind energy, started production. The Vito platform in the US Gulf of Mexico also started production, with 80% less CO2emissions expected over its lifetime compared with the original design.The Hollandse Kust Noord wind park off the coast of the Netherlands became operational.Shell's management team hosted its first Capital Markets Day in New York and set out Shell's strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.Achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 6-8% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016.Reduced our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 31% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016, more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030 on a net basis.Won majority shareholder support (80% of votes) for our energy transition progress at our Annual General Meeting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2022</emphasis></p><p>Completed the acquisition of renewable power company Sprng Energy, and took a final investment decision on Holland Hydrogen 1 and LNG expansion projects in Qatar.Introduced three new metrics in the annual bonus scorecard to reflect Shell's role in the energy transition.

Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity.Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by 2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category 11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The energy system: our beliefs</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in\u00a0many developing countries where security of\u00a0supply and stable prices are critical to their\u00a0development.</emphasis></p><p>The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250\u00a0mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil,\u00a080 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas.</p><p>As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be\u00a0linear, as different countries take different approaches and\u00a0move at different paces.</p><p>Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to\u00a0create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at\u00a0scale. This will\u00a0require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the\u00a0new\u00a0energy system.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Developing our beliefs</p><p>We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u00a0and several other external bodies.</p><p>We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs.</p><p>Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of\u00a0Technology. We will continue to challenge our own\u00a0beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Increasing demand</emphasis></p><p>Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and\u00a0industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more\u00a0than a quarter of the world's population\u00a0still lack basic\u00a0energy provisions.</p><p>Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the\u00a0Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the\u00a0second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in\u00a0electric vehicles.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the\u00a0last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per\u00a0annum (mtpa) in\u00a01983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a\u00a0figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and\u00a0can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping.</p><p>Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by\u00a0strong demand in developing economies.

Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%.

The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heavy industry</emphasis></p><p>Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of\u00a0steel\u00a0and cement, which use high-temperature processes that\u00a0can\u00a0be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of\u00a0coal,\u00a0gas\u00a0and electricity.</p><p>Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A].</p><p>Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in\u00a0energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement.</p><p>The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the\u00a0industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two\u00a0decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations.</p><p>More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Light industry</emphasis></p><p>Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy\u00a0equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of\u00a0light\u00a0industry have already switched to electrification. We\u00a0see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also\u00a0needed to decarbonise the sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-energy use</emphasis></p><p>Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We\u00a0believe bio-feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this\u00a0sector.</p><p>Source: International Energy Agency.

In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive.

Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40\u00a0million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by\u00a02030. The availability of charging points will be\u00a0critical for\u00a0the growth in electric vehicles.</p><p>The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is\u00a0in China, the world's largest car market, followed by\u00a0Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport</emphasis></p><p>Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or\u00a0hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and\u00a0customer preferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation</emphasis></p><p>Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a\u00a0credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than\u00a00.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to\u00a0grow with support from governments.</p><p>Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it\u00a0costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shipping</emphasis></p><p>Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of\u00a0shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with\u00a0conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25%\u00a0of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We\u00a0believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the\u00a0long term, but we see challenges with both of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buildings</emphasis></p><p>Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be\u00a0key to continuing this trend.</p><p>Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to\u00a02026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power</emphasis></p><p>Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023.</p><p>Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040.</p><p>We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their\u00a0scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of\u00a0national electricity grids.</p><p>We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon abatement</emphasis></p><p>We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and\u00a0standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could\u00a0emerge.</p><p>Carbon credits\u00a0may be used to compensate for emissions in\u00a0line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation.</p><p>The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to\u00a0limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a\u00a0year carbon removals, which will need to\u00a0be financed by\u00a0emitters purchasing carbon credits.</p><p>Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2emissions. While there are\u00a0only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.</p><p>Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023.

We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry,\u00a0construction and road.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We are upgrading our retail network, with\u00a0expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to\u00a0supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils\u00a0used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support\u00a0the development of electric vehicle car batteries.</p><p>Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we\u00a0meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both\u00a0conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in\u00a0low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building for tomorrow (2025+)</emphasis></p><p>To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low-carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are\u00a0focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000\u00a0today.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future.</p><p>Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own\u00a0production and sales of biofuels in the coming years.</p><p>We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These\u00a0fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road\u00a0transport. To\u00a0support our production of biofuels, we\u00a0are\u00a0investing in new feedstocks through investments and\u00a0partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to\u00a0expand sales beyond our production volumes.</p><p>Through our Ra\u00edzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and\u00a0sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on\u00a0the\u00a0environment and food supplies.</p><p>Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the\u00a0largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power</emphasis></p><p>We will continue to grow our integrated power business with\u00a0selective investments in renewable power generation. We\u00a0will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our\u00a0ventures programme and investments in research and\u00a0development.</p><p>We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our\u00a0strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to\u00a0decarbonise our own operations.</p><p>Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at\u00a0around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.</p><p>Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing for the future (2030+)</emphasis></p><p>This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon\u00a0capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030.</p><p>We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to\u00a0deliver affordable low-cost solutions to\u00a0our customers.</p><p>We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be\u00a0directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and removal</emphasis></p><p>We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations.</p><p>We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable\u00a0CCS projects.</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in\u00a0the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground.</p><p>In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning\u00a0global carbon market will be a critical enabler of\u00a0an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a\u00a0diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers\u00a0decarbonise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our transitions plans cover all our businesses</emphasis></p><p>Leading Integrated Gas</p><p>Advantaged Upstream</p><p>Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused decarbonisation pathways</emphasis></p><p>We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Passenger road transport:</emphasis></p><p>Between now and 2030: Oil products, Biofuel solutions and electric charging</p><p>Between 2030 &amp; 2040: Electric charging, biofuel solutions and oil products</p><p>From 2040 onwards: Electric charging and oil products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport:</emphasis></p><p>Between now and the mid 2030's: Oil products, Biofuel solutions, liquified natural gas and electric charging</p><p>From the mid 2030's onwards: Biofuel solutions, electric charging, oil products and green hydrogen</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation:</emphasis></p><p>Between now and the end of the 2030's: Oil products, biofuels solutions and synthetic fuels</p><p>From the end of the 2030's onwards: Biofuel solutions, synthetic fuels and oil products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marine:</emphasis></p><p>Between now and the mid 2030's: Oil products, liquified natural gas and biofuel solutions</p><p>From the mid 2030's onwards: Oil products, biofuel solutions, liquified natural gas and hydrogen and derivatives</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Industry and Services:</emphasis></p><p>Pathway 1: Between now and the mid 2030's: Liquified natural gas with carbon capture and storage and renewable natural gas.

Our strategy is based\u00a0on\u00a0the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by\u00a02030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensityof our operations.</p><p>Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%,non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to\u00a0reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it\u00a0starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in\u00a02024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p>In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects.</p><p>By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this\u00a0decade.</p><p>Shell is working with shipping companies to\u00a0help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim\u00a0of\u00a0switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in\u00a0the longer term.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Artificial intelligence for LNG</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by\u00a0around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment.</p><p>Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a\u00a0founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or\u00a0reporting beyond our operations.</p><p>We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future.</p><p>We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor\u00a0the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at\u00a0our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800\u00a0tonnes since\u00a02017.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Aggregated average performance of Oil and Gas Climate initiative companies.</p><p>[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in\u00a0our Upstream business</emphasis></p><p>In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects.</p><p>Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf\u00a0of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80%\u00a0over its operating life, compared with its original design. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of\u00a0creating more value with less emissions.</p><p>Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta.</p><p>We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the\u00a0emissions needed to develop the project.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Reducing routine flaring</p><p>We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target\u00a0is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us\u00a0to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022.</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field\u00a0(Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas\u00a0recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be\u00a0powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity.</p><p>Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in\u00a0the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by\u00a0transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany.</p><p>In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025.</p><p>When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane\u00a0liquefaction plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our\u00a0customers decarbonise without having to change their cars,\u00a0trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of\u00a0the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of\u00a0the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\u00edzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in\u00a02022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to\u00a0build in Brazil.</p><p>In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns\u00a0and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant\u00a0in the Netherlands.</p><p>The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than\u00a0half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of\u00a0global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in\u00a0Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari</p><p>Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to\u00a0meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our\u00a0public charging network, currently operates in around 33\u00a0countries.</p><p>We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in\u00a0the\u00a0world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000\u00a0kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year.</p><p>The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has\u00a0a\u00a0utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business.</p><p>In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in\u00a0the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000\u00a0charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400\u00a0additional charge points in development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power positions</emphasis></p><p>Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia.</p><p>In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power.</p><p>We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also\u00a0developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and\u00a0Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands.</p><p>In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust\u00a0West.</p><p>We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in\u00a0select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in\u00a0late 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis></p><p>We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it\u00a0becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for\u00a0the future.</p><p>To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We\u00a0see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport.</p><p>At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in\u00a0the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of\u00a0our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and\u00a0industry.</p><p>In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up\u00a0to\u00a025 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by\u00a0the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity.</p><p>As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The\u00a0consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</emphasis></p><p>Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.</p><p>CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals\u00a0of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS\u00a0lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects.</p><p>By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of\u00a0increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000\u00a0tonnes a year [A].</p><p>Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2a year. The CO2will be shipped from two of \u00d8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea.</p><p>In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9\u00a0million tonnes of CO2equivalent by the end of 2023. In\u00a0addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the\u00a0world.</p><p>Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2a year. The\u00a0captured CO2will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast.\u00a0This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2emissions\u00a0by around 2% for 15 years from 2026.</p><p>[A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error.</p><p>In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in\u00a0the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round.

In 2023, we took the\u00a0decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in\u00a0Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated energy hubs</emphasis></p><p>As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and\u00a0Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into\u00a0our existing facilities.</p><p>We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help\u00a0to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and\u00a0chemicals park once operational.

They\u00a0may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon\u00a0benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a\u00a0high quality.</p><p>We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.</p><p>We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the\u00a0market.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by\u00a0Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units.</p><p>Tracking SAF with blockchain</p><p>We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and\u00a0molecules.</p><p>Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with\u00a0Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to\u00a0delivery into aviation fuelling networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology and innovation</emphasis></p><p>Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our\u00a0company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022.

This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and\u00a0CO2emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers.</p><p>We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in\u00a0the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus\u00a0on\u00a0electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and\u00a0materials.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Powering industry through investments</p><p>Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions.</p><p>In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to\u00a0help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat.</p><p>Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and\u00a0reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry.

With the right policy and\u00a0regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions.</p><p>Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.</p><p>Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our\u00a0advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world.</p><p>In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy and advocacy</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy Themes:</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Achieving net-zero emissions</emphasis></p><p>Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B Supplying the secure energy the world needs</emphasis></p><p>Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C Driving changes in demand</emphasis></p><p>Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">D Growing low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)</p><p>Read more about our policy positions on Shell.com/advocacy-and-political-activity</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy in action</emphasis></p><p>Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low-carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators.</p><p>In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects.</p><p>We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions.</p><p>In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p>We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal.</p><p>In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS.

Our investments in\u00a0producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell.

These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our\u00a0Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in\u00a0reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions intensity [A], [D]</emphasis></p><p>Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl.

Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.</p><p>Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of\u00a0five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing net carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of\u00a0the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050.</p><p>The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a\u00a02016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a\u00a0strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our\u00a0integrated power business, including renewable power, in\u00a0places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.</p><p>In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the\u00a0energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our\u00a0previous target of a 20% reduction.</p><p>Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a\u00a045% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The\u00a0chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030.</p><p>The change in our sales\u00a0of these products and services will also\u00a0reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the\u00a0adoption of public policies designed\u00a0to\u00a0encourage the energy transition.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in\u00a0grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)</emphasis></p><p>NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually.

That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world.</p><p>Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as\u00a0they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016.

For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report\u00a0(AR6).</p><p>We start with the complete set of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios [A] and\u00a0then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We\u00a0then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\u00b0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.</p><p>These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5\u00b0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a\u00a0scenario exceeds 1.5\u00b0C before returning.</p><p>We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.

As a result, we are developing a\u00a0multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for\u00a0aviation, that will be created through new technologies.</p><p>At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and\u00a0storage to further reduce emissions.</p><p>In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen.</p><p>While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share of global primary energy mix (%)</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Just transition and governance</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A just transition</emphasis></p><p>A successful energy transition depends on more than financial investment and technological advances.

This\u00a0requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce.</p><p>We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a\u00a0focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation.</p><p>In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and\u00a0storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p>We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights\u00a0and labour rights.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Equal opportunities</emphasis></p><p>Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under-represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most\u00a0diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of\u00a0our business.

The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery.</p><p>In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.</p><p>Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the\u00a02023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for\u00a0senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both\u00a0vesting in 2026.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Carbon management framework (CMF)</p><p>We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes.</p><p>To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and\u00a0generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per\u00a0unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each\u00a0other.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our\u00a0journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:</p><p>Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net basis (2016 baseline); Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025\u00a0[A]; andMaintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and\u00a0achieving near-zero methane emissions by 2030.</p><p>It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030\u00a0and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil\u00a0products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material.</p><p>In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our\u00a0annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to\u00a0build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:</p><p>LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were\u00a0517\u00a0million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Energy transition and advisory votes</p><p>Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself.</p><p>As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p>Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that\u00a0reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a\u00a0\"significant best efforts basis\".</p><p>We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change.</p><p>It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which\u00a0has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world.</p><p>Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024.

Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement.

Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>\"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>\"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan.</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas.</p><p>We have made good progress against our climate targets:</p><p>By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity - significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the third consecutive year we hit our target.</p><p>As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A]</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe.</p><p>In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%.</p><p>We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Driving towards a net-zero future</emphasis>We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending.</p><p>These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and performance please read the full report, online here:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at Shell's 2024 AGM. Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions.</p><p>Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from\u00a0our operations and energy products while becoming an\u00a0increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans\u00a0cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and\u00a0Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we\u00a0believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Helping reduce emissions for our customers</emphasis>We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to\u00a0sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel.</p><p>To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].</p><p>Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\u00edzenCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from\u00a0fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the\u00a0energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future.</p><p>Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for\u00a0many years with oil, gas and LNG.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to\u00a0build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technologies of the future</emphasis>We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too.</p><p>I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to\u00a0produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value with less emissions</emphasis>At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to\u00a0our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and shareholder support</emphasis>In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I\u00a0appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to\u00a0our\u00a0next engagement in April 2024.</p><p>The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update.</p><p>This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at\u00a0our\u00a0Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board\u00a0and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sir Andrew Mackenzie</emphasis>Chair</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Executive Officer's introduction</emphasis></p><p>This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we\u00a0published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our\u00a0progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for\u00a0energy will only grow.</p><p>At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero.</p><p>I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in\u00a0the direction of our strategy.</p><p>Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the\u00a0world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to\u00a0use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to\u00a0provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Progress towards our targets</emphasis>Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with\u00a0renewable energy.</p><p>We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of\u00a0methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of\u00a0the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value, less emissions</emphasis>At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In\u00a0this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the\u00a0same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In\u00a0Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as\u00a0biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future.</p><p>Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on\u00a0delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing emissions from production</emphasis>We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen.</p><p>We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It\u00a0continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as\u00a0wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by\u00a0replacing coal.</p><p>In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to\u00a0lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint\u00a0venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by\u00a0more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities.</p><p>The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around\u00a080% less carbon dioxide emissions over its</p><p>operating\u00a0life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting our customers as they decarbonise</emphasis>We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have\u00a0competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and\u00a0identify clear regulatory support from governments. The\u00a0transport sector is a good example.</p><p>We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to\u00a0help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in\u00a0biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to\u00a0focus on four regional energy\u00a0and chemicals parks, we are\u00a0creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future.</p><p>As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a\u00a0new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most\u00a0progressive in the world.</p><p>Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is\u00a0selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to\u00a0retail customers. As a result, we\u00a0expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our\u00a0net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis>In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices\u00a0for our customers.</p><p>Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into\u00a0a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are\u00a0the investment case and the partner of choice through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wael Sawan</emphasis>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions.</emphasis></p><p>1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%.</p><p>5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly.</p><p>6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year.</p><p>7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]</p><p>Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.</p><p>8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge.</p><p>9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p>10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our journey towards net zero</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023</emphasis></p><p>Invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions, of our total capital spending of $24.4 billion in 2023. This included the acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe.Our Timi platform in Malaysia, mainly powered by solar and wind energy, started production. The Vito platform in the US Gulf of Mexico also started production, with 80% less CO2emissions expected over its lifetime compared with the original design.The Hollandse Kust Noord wind park off the coast of the Netherlands became operational.Shell's management team hosted its first Capital Markets Day in New York and set out Shell's strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.Achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 6-8% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016.Reduced our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 31% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016, more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030 on a net basis.Won majority shareholder support (80% of votes) for our energy transition progress at our Annual General Meeting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2022</emphasis></p><p>Completed the acquisition of renewable power company Sprng Energy, and took a final investment decision on Holland Hydrogen 1 and LNG expansion projects in Qatar.Introduced three new metrics in the annual bonus scorecard to reflect Shell's role in the energy transition.

There is even greater reliance in\u00a0many developing countries where security of\u00a0supply and stable prices are critical to their\u00a0development.</emphasis></p><p>The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250\u00a0mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil,\u00a080 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas.</p><p>As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be\u00a0linear, as different countries take different approaches and\u00a0move at different paces.</p><p>Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to\u00a0create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at\u00a0scale. This will\u00a0require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the\u00a0new\u00a0energy system.</p><p>Developing our beliefs</p><p>We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u00a0and several other external bodies.</p><p>We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs.</p><p>Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of\u00a0Technology. We will continue to challenge our own\u00a0beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Increasing demand</emphasis>Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and\u00a0industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more\u00a0than a quarter of the world's population\u00a0still lack basic\u00a0energy provisions.</p><p>Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the\u00a0Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the\u00a0second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in\u00a0electric vehicles.</p><p>Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023).</p><p>Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the\u00a0last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per\u00a0annum (mtpa) in\u00a01983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023.</p><p>Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a\u00a0figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and\u00a0can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe.</p><p>The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping.</p><p>Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by\u00a0strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to\u00a0rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Primary energy demand by region and energy source, 2023 (exajoule)</emphasis></p><p>[A] Electric renewables are dominated hydroelectricity, wind, and solar.

To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Final energy demand by sector and energy carrier, 2023 (exajoule)</emphasis></p><p>[A] Gaseous is mostly natural gas; Solids is mostly coal; Liquids is mostly oil.

Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.</p><p>[A] Includes emissions from industrial processes, 18% of total.[B] Includes rail, 3.5% of total.[C] Emissions for operation of buildings - not construction (which is in industry sectors).[D] 70% methane, from agriculture and fossil production and use; 23% nitrous oxide; 7% others.[E] land use, land-use change emissions and forestry (LULUCF).Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Industry</emphasis></p><p>Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil,\u00a0gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand.</p><p>Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heavy industry</emphasis>Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of\u00a0steel\u00a0and cement, which use high-temperature processes that\u00a0can\u00a0be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of\u00a0coal,\u00a0gas\u00a0and electricity.</p><p>Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A].</p><p>Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in\u00a0energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement.</p><p>The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the\u00a0industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two\u00a0decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations.</p><p>More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Light industry</emphasis>Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy\u00a0equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of\u00a0light\u00a0industry have already switched to electrification. We\u00a0see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also\u00a0needed to decarbonise the sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-energy use</emphasis>Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We\u00a0believe bio-feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this\u00a0sector.</p><p>Source: International Energy Agency.

Global CO2emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a\u00a0year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions.</p><p>Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio-alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.</p><p>[A] Noth-west European retail prices.[B] Beyond production costs, taxes significantly increase the price customers pay for biodiesel, diesel and gasoline.[C] Electric costs (0.2-0.6$kWh) adjusted for 2.4x higher efficiency of electric versus international combustion engine vehicles.

Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40\u00a0million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by\u00a02030. The availability of charging points will be\u00a0critical for\u00a0the growth in electric vehicles.</p><p>The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is\u00a0in China, the world's largest car market, followed by\u00a0Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport</emphasis>Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or\u00a0hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and\u00a0customer preferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation</emphasis>Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a\u00a0credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than\u00a00.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to\u00a0grow with support from governments.</p><p>Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it\u00a0costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shipping</emphasis>Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of\u00a0shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with\u00a0conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25%\u00a0of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We\u00a0believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the\u00a0long term, but we see challenges with both of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buildings</emphasis></p><p>Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be\u00a0key to continuing this trend.</p><p>Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to\u00a02026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power</emphasis></p><p>Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023.</p><p>Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040.</p><p>We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their\u00a0scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of\u00a0national electricity grids.</p><p>We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon abatement</emphasis></p><p>We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and\u00a0standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could\u00a0emerge.</p><p>Carbon credits\u00a0may be used to compensate for emissions in\u00a0line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation.</p><p>The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to\u00a0limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a\u00a0year carbon removals, which will need to\u00a0be financed by\u00a0emitters purchasing carbon credits.</p><p>Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2emissions. While there are\u00a0only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.</p><p>Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023.

We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry.</p><p>We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry.</p><p>We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non-operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025.

Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice.</p><p>Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector.</p><p>We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Role of LNG in the energy transition</emphasis></p><p>Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp\u00a0up or down. LNG will be\u00a0essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of\u00a0renewables increases.</p><p>Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to\u00a0the emissions released by coal-fired plants.</p><p>Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas\u00a0and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on\u00a0their decarbonisation journeys.</p><p>Source: Shell interpretation of Kpler, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights and FGE data, Wood Mackenzie and FGW data.</p><p>Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector,\u00a0gas and LNG will also have an important role. They\u00a0will continue to provide\u00a0the flexibility electricity grids\u00a0will need,\u00a0and energy security in the coming decades in\u00a0developed countries.</p><p>Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels.</p><p>Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gas displacement of coal in US power generation is helping to drive CO2 emissions lower</emphasis></p><p>Source: US Energy Information Administration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advantaged Upstream</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while\u00a0keeping oil production stable</emphasis></p><p>We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maintaining oil production this decade</emphasis>Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023\u00a0had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to\u00a02030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our\u00a0high-margin deep-water positions.</p><p>Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A].</p><p>From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production.</p><p>As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on\u00a0the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.</p><p>A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).</p><p>[A] Peer range comprises BP, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Chevron and represents all Integrated Gas and Upstream related activities. based on external reporting and Shell internal analysis including peer working capital assumptions.[B] Shell internal analysis of Woodmac Lens data.

We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible.</p><p>We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transforming our businesses to offer more</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">low-carbon solutions while reducing sales</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">of oil products</emphasis></p><p>We are reshaping our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses with a more focused geographic portfolio of products to deliver more value with less emissions. We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments.</p><p>We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly.</p><p>In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for\u00a0cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives.</p><p>As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a\u00a0result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products.</p><p>Our strategy is to:</p><p>Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own production, will help\u00a0us\u00a0deliver affordable and low-carbon solutionsfor our customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future</emphasis></p><p>Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and lubricant offeringsBuilding for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuelsPreparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storageSupported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delivering today</emphasis></p><p>Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low-carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced.</p><p>We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the\u00a0USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell\u00a0Pakistan.</p><p>Oil for lubricants and chemicals</p><p>Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry,\u00a0construction and road.</p><p>We are upgrading our retail network, with\u00a0expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to\u00a0supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils\u00a0used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support\u00a0the development of electric vehicle car batteries.</p><p>Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we\u00a0meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both\u00a0conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in\u00a0low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building for tomorrow (2025+)</emphasis></p><p>To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low-carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are\u00a0focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000\u00a0today.</p><p>We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future.</p><p>Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own\u00a0production and sales of biofuels in the coming years.</p><p>We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These\u00a0fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road\u00a0transport. To\u00a0support our production of biofuels, we\u00a0are\u00a0investing in new feedstocks through investments and\u00a0partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to\u00a0expand sales beyond our production volumes.</p><p>Through our Ra\u00edzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and\u00a0sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on\u00a0the\u00a0environment and food supplies.</p><p>Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the\u00a0largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power</emphasis></p><p>We will continue to grow our integrated power business with\u00a0selective investments in renewable power generation. We\u00a0will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our\u00a0ventures programme and investments in research and\u00a0development.</p><p>We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our\u00a0strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to\u00a0decarbonise our own operations.</p><p>Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at\u00a0around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.</p><p>[A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing for the future (2030+)</emphasis></p><p>This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon\u00a0capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030.</p><p>We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to\u00a0deliver affordable low-cost solutions to\u00a0our customers.</p><p>We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be\u00a0directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and removal</emphasis></p><p>We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations.</p><p>We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable\u00a0CCS projects.</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in\u00a0the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground.</p><p>In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning\u00a0global carbon market will be a critical enabler of\u00a0an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a\u00a0diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers\u00a0decarbonise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our transitions plans cover all our businesses</emphasis></p><p>Leading Integrated Gas</p><p>Advantaged Upstream</p><p>Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused decarbonisation pathways</emphasis>We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry.

The commissioning process is expected to begin in\u00a02024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p>In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects.</p><p>By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this\u00a0decade.</p><p>Shell is working with shipping companies to\u00a0help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim\u00a0of\u00a0switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in\u00a0the longer term.</p><p>Artificial intelligence for LNG</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by\u00a0around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment.</p><p>Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a\u00a0founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or\u00a0reporting beyond our operations.</p><p>We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future.</p><p>We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor\u00a0the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at\u00a0our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800\u00a0tonnes since\u00a02017.</p><p>[A] Aggregated average performance of Oil and Gas Climate initiative companies.[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in\u00a0our Upstream business</emphasis></p><p>In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects.</p><p>Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf\u00a0of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80%\u00a0over its operating life, compared with its original design. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of\u00a0creating more value with less emissions.</p><p>Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta.</p><p>We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the\u00a0emissions needed to develop the project.</p><p>Reducing routine flaring</p><p>We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target\u00a0is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us\u00a0to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022.</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field\u00a0(Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas\u00a0recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be\u00a0powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity.</p><p>Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in\u00a0the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by\u00a0transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany.</p><p>In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025.</p><p>When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane\u00a0liquefaction plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis>We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our\u00a0customers decarbonise without having to change their cars,\u00a0trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of\u00a0the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of\u00a0the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\u00edzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in\u00a02022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to\u00a0build in Brazil.</p><p>In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns\u00a0and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant\u00a0in the Netherlands.</p><p>The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than\u00a0half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of\u00a0global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in\u00a0Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels.</p><p>Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari</p><p>Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to\u00a0meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis>Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our\u00a0public charging network, currently operates in around 33\u00a0countries.</p><p>We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in\u00a0the\u00a0world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000\u00a0kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year.</p><p>The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has\u00a0a\u00a0utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business.</p><p>In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in\u00a0the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000\u00a0charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400\u00a0additional charge points in development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power positions</emphasis>Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia.</p><p>In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power.</p><p>We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also\u00a0developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and\u00a0Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands.</p><p>In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust\u00a0West.</p><p>We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in\u00a0select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in\u00a0late 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis>We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it\u00a0becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for\u00a0the future.</p><p>To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We\u00a0see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport.</p><p>At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in\u00a0the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of\u00a0our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and\u00a0industry.</p><p>In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up\u00a0to\u00a025 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by\u00a0the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity.</p><p>As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The\u00a0consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</emphasis>Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.</p><p>CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals\u00a0of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS\u00a0lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects.</p><p>By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of\u00a0increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000\u00a0tonnes a year.</p><p>Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2a year. The CO2will be shipped from two of \u00d8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea.</p><p>In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9\u00a0million tonnes of CO2equivalent by the end of 2023. In\u00a0addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the\u00a0world.</p><p>Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2a year. The\u00a0captured CO2will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast.\u00a0This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2emissions\u00a0by around 2% for 15 years from 2026.</p><p>In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in\u00a0the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK.</p><p>Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2a year.</p><p>Direct air capture</p><p>Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the\u00a0decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in\u00a0Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated energy hubs</emphasis></p><p>As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and\u00a0Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into\u00a0our existing facilities.</p><p>We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help\u00a0to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and\u00a0chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will\u00a0be\u00a0powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust\u00a0(noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and\u00a0stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest\u00a0customer, and Aramis, a joint venture.</p><p>As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holland Hydrogen 1</emphasis>Power: Hollandse Kusst (noord) wind farm - 759MW to Data centres and Shell Holland Hydrogen 1 - 200MW</p><p>C02:Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to Aramis CCS- 5 mpta store and Porthos CCS- 2.5 mpta store</p><p>Hydrogen: From Shell holland Hydrogen 1 200MW to Shell</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon credits</emphasis>Carbon credits can make an important contribution to our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. They\u00a0may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon\u00a0benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a\u00a0high quality.</p><p>We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.</p><p>We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the\u00a0market.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by\u00a0Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units.</p><p>Tracking SAF with blockchain</p><p>We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and\u00a0molecules.</p><p>Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with\u00a0Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to\u00a0delivery into aviation fuelling networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology and innovation</emphasis>Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our\u00a0company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49%\u00a0of our total expenditure on research and development, up\u00a0from around 41% in 2022.</p><p>[A] Shell analysis of data published by peer companies (TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron) in annual reports with the note that definitions of R&amp;D vary between companies.</p><p>Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:</p><p>Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today. For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they emit.Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions.</p><p>The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors.</p><p>At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and\u00a0CO2emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers.</p><p>We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in\u00a0the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus\u00a0on\u00a0electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and\u00a0materials.</p><p>Powering industry through investments</p><p>Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions.</p><p>In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to\u00a0help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat.</p><p>Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and\u00a0reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The\u00a0storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate policy engagement</emphasis></p><p>Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial\u00a0part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and\u00a0regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions.</p><p>Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.</p><p>Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our\u00a0advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world.</p><p>In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy and advocacy</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy Themes:</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Achieving net-zero emissions</emphasis>Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B Supplying the secure energy the world needs</emphasis>Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C Driving changes in demand</emphasis>Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">D Growing low-carbon solutions</emphasis>Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)</p><p>Read more about our policy positions on Shell.com/advocacy-and-political-activity</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy in action</emphasis></p><p>Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low-carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators.</p><p>In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects.</p><p>We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions.</p><p>In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p>We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal.</p><p>In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross-border CCS\u00a0hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region.</p><p>In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy transition in action</emphasis></p><p>Selection of portfolio developments [A]</p><p>These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets, ambitions and\u00a0performance</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050</emphasis></p><p>It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring.</p><p>We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets and ambitions</emphasis></p><p>Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3)</p><p>Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030</p><p>Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>Updated</p><p>Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition</emphasis>New</p><p>Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)</p><p>On a net basis.Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions</emphasis></p><p>In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.</p><p>To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:</p><p>making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and reducing our\u00a0production through the natural decline of existing oil and\u00a0gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining integrated refineries intolow-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;using more renewable electricity to power our operations; anddeveloping carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities.</p><p>If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate.</p><p>The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our\u00a0Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we\u00a0expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in\u00a0producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions</emphasis>Scope 1 and 2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A], [B]</p><p>The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Operational control boundary.Including nature-based solutions.</p><p>Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO2e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria\u00a0Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our\u00a0Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions</emphasis>Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in\u00a0reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions intensity [A], [D]</emphasis></p><p>Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl.

Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.</p><p>Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of\u00a0five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing net carbon intensity</emphasis>We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of\u00a0the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050.</p><p>The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a\u00a02016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a\u00a0strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our\u00a0integrated power business, including renewable power, in\u00a0places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.</p><p>In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the\u00a0energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our\u00a0previous target of a 20% reduction.</p><p>Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a\u00a045% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The\u00a0chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030.</p><p>The change in our sales\u00a0of these products and services will also\u00a0reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the\u00a0adoption of public policies designed\u00a0to\u00a0encourage the energy transition.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in\u00a0grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)</emphasis>NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p>We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the\u00a0use of our oil products</emphasis></p><p>We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world.</p><p>Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as\u00a0they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..</p><p>[A] Including blending GLT[B] Liquefied natural gas[C] Liquefied petroleum</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris alignment</emphasis></p><p>The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\".</p><p>Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report\u00a0(AR6).</p><p>We start with the complete set of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios [A] and\u00a0then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We\u00a0then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\u00b0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.</p><p>These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5\u00b0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a\u00a0scenario exceeds 1.5\u00b0C before returning.</p><p>We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.</p><p>Read more about our approach at shell.com/sustainability/our-climate-target/our-climate-target-faqs</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell net zero by 2050</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We are committed to our target to become a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</emphasis></p><p>To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Critical factors on the path to net zero</emphasis>The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this.</p><p>We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p>To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net\u00a0zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and\u00a0heat and power storage solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Multi-energy business</emphasis>There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of\u00a0the\u00a0future energy system. As a result, we are developing a\u00a0multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for\u00a0aviation, that will be created through new technologies.</p><p>At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and\u00a0storage to further reduce emissions.</p><p>In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen.</p><p>While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share of global primary energy mix (%)</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Just transition and governance</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A just transition</emphasis></p><p>A successful energy transition depends on more than financial investment and technological advances. It also needs to be a\u00a0just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.</p><p>Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Closing the energy access gap</emphasis>Today, around 675 million people do not have access to\u00a0electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and\u00a0Social Affairs.</p><p>Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative\u00a0to help people get access to energy in the near and\u00a0medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and\u00a0South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Skills for the future</emphasis>As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This\u00a0requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce.</p><p>We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a\u00a0focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation.</p><p>In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and\u00a0storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p>We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights\u00a0and labour rights.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Equal opportunities</emphasis>Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under-represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most\u00a0diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of\u00a0our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Communities</emphasis>At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the\u00a0proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over\u00a0the\u00a0next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a\u00a0community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will\u00a0use as the community sees\u00a0best.</p><p>In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the\u00a0country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human rights, governments and industry</emphasis>Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set\u00a0out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.</p><p>Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate governance</emphasis></p><p>Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on\u00a0the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery.</p><p>In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.</p><p>Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the\u00a02023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for\u00a0senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both\u00a0vesting in 2026.</p><p>Carbon management framework (CMF)</p><p>We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes.</p><p>To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and\u00a0generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per\u00a0unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each\u00a0other.</p><p>For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our\u00a0journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:</p><p>Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net basis (2016 baseline); Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025\u00a0[A]; andMaintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and\u00a0achieving near-zero methane emissions by 2030.</p><p>It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030\u00a0and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil\u00a0products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material.</p><p>In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our\u00a0annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to\u00a0build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:</p><p>LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were\u00a0517\u00a0million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023.</p><p>Energy transition and advisory votes</p><p>Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself.</p><p>As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p>Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that\u00a0reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a\u00a0\"significant best efforts basis\".</p><p>We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change.</p><p>It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which\u00a0has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world.</p><p>Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate standards and benchmarks</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition.</emphasis></p><p>They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties\u00a0and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria.</p><p>Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations.</p><p>Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as\u00a0our\u00a0efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over\u00a0the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as\u00a0evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate\u00a0disclosures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESG rating agencies [B]</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISS</emphasis>The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050.

TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark.</p><p>TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a\u00a0company's targets and plans are aligned in the short-term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050).</p><p>In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the\u00a0highest score of four (strategic assessment) for\u00a0the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks\u00a0and\u00a0opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This\u00a0exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90)</p><p>In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\u00b0C benchmark. This is the\u00a0result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate Action 100+</emphasis>Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with\u00a0assets of around $68 trillion.</p><p>Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three\u202fhigh-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures.

The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May\u00a029, 2023.</p><p>We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that\u00a0our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome\u00a0in their assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures</emphasis>Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.</p><p>Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures.

Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or\u00a0its subsidiaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net-zero emissions target</emphasis>Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking non-GAAP measures</emphasis>This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort.

The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels.

But, above all, biodiversity plays an indispensable role in the stability of the planet.\"</p><p>At present, 70 percent of ecosystems around the world are in a state of degradation, largely due to human activity \u2013 a rate of decline described as \"unprecedented and dangerous\" by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).</p><p>In addition, more than 1 million species are threatened with extinction. Vertebrates, which include mammals, fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians and make up five percent of all animal species, are especially under threat. \"Our previous report found that there had been a 68 percent fall among the total [vertebrate] population [over 50 years],\" says Pierre Cannet, director of advocacy and campaigns at WWFFrance. In 2022 that figure has risen to 69 percent. \"Losing one percent in two years is massive. For species that already have small populations, it could mean extinction.\"</p><p>Climate imbalance: A growing threat </p><p>According to the IPBES, the most significant driving factor of the \"biodiversity crisis\" is change in how land is used and fragmentation of natural space, most often due to agriculture. This is followed by overfishing, hunting and poaching. There is a tie for third place between climate imbalance, pollution and invasive species.</p><p>\"In the majority of cases there are multiple factors at play,\" says Grandcolas. \"But climate imbalance is becoming the most significant threat. The more it escalates, the more it disturbs ecosystems and has an impact on flora and fauna.\"</p><p>There are plenty of examples of this impact. In the past 30 years elephant populations in African forests have fallen by 86 percent. The main causes are poaching and black market trade, causing the death of 20,000 to 30,000 elephants per year, according to the WWF. But repeated cycles of drought and flood are also having an impact on access to fresh water \u2013 a vital resource for the species as each animal consumes around 150 to 200 litres per day. Without it their survival is at risk.</p><p>Similarly, leatherback sea turtles in Suriname have seen their populations fall by 95 percent in 20 years. This is due in part to destruction of their habitat caused by human intervention and illegal fishing. But climate instability is also disrupting their reproduction rates as sea level rise has destroyed and disrupted turtle nesting beaches.</p><p>Mass deaths </p><p>\"Currently there are a few species that are classed having climate change as the reason for their extinction,\" says Camille Parmesan, research director at CNRS and author of the first report of its kind on the links between climate change and biodiversity, produced by IPBES and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021. Yet this is the reason for the demise of the Bramble Cay melomys: \"a species of little rodent that lived on the small islands between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Scientists proved that their disappearance was due to their habitat being submerged [by the sea],\" Parmesan says.</p><p>\"We have also noted the disappearance of 92 amphibian species, killed by the growth of a type of fungus. We have proof that it developed due to climate instability which modified ecosystems and created the right conditions for it to thrive.\"</p><p>The number of species that are officially classed as having died out due to climate instability may be low, but increasing extreme weather events are causing mass deaths among mammals, birds, fish and trees. \"In Australia, we counted 45,000 flying fox deaths [a type of bat] in a single day during a heatwave\", Parmesan says. In France, record summer heat in 2022 caused temperatures in the Mediterranean Sea to rise to levels that killed thousands of fish and shellfish.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Biodiversity: Ocean 'dead zones' are proliferating due to global warming</p><p>Yet, disappearing species is not the only consequence of climate change. \"We can also add behaviour changes, notably migrations induced by climate modifications,\" Parmesan adds. \"Certain species try to move to [new] habitats that are more favourable but this can cause even more disruption in ecosystems.\"</p><p>Biodiverse carbon storage </p><p>Shrinking biodiversity also has multiple consequences on human life. In some parts of the world it can disrupt economies reliant on fishing or hunting and negatively impact the tourism industry.</p><p>\"It's a vicious circle. Biodiversity is a victim of global warming, but it is also one of the major tools to fight against it\", says S\u00e9bastien Barot, researcher at French public research institution Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD).</p><p>From plant life to animal species, individual elements of the natural world all contribute to regulating and supporting the environment as a whole. Bardot says, \"water and earth play a role in filtering pollution, and bumblebees are essential for plant reproduction\".</p><p>But when one element is compromised the rest can suffer too. \"The survival of the planet depends on a fine balance,\" says Grandcolas. \"Imagine a group of frogs suddenly die in a habitat. As insignificant as that may seem, it will have an impact: by disappearing they modify the conditions of the environment. This could allow other species to develop, damage plant life and lead to progressive destruction of the ecosystem, which will then no longer be able to play its role as a climate regulator.\"</p><p>Nowhere is this more evident that with carbon storage. Scientists estimate that the earth and sea currently absorb almost 50 percent of C02 created by human activity. \"Forests, wetlands, mangrove swamps and even deep water are real C02 sinks. When they disappear, emissions are released into the atmosphere,\" Barot says.</p><p>Consequently, \"when we see a forest burn, we are watching a carbon sink disappear\", says Grandcolas. In this way, \"[the presence of] plant life has an obvious impact on the climate.\"</p><p>Two crises, one solution? </p><p>Experts agree on the need to tackle both the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis at the same time. \"We tend to treat them as separate entities, but they go hand in hand,\" says Grandcolas. \"They should be seen as a joint struggle with equal importance. For this to happen, we need to give nature the space it deserves.\"</p><p>Scientists and the WWF have called for more nature-based solutions for both issues. One of the most prominent is increasing protected habitats, which currently make up 17 percent of land and eight percent of ocean globally. \"We need to increase that to 30-50 percent of the planet,\" says Grandcolas. A significant step towards this goal, he adds, would be better global policies for fighting deforestation as preserving forests has the potential to both protect biodiversity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>\"There are also many things to consider in terms of agriculture,\" says Barot. \"We need agriculture systems that are more durable such as developing agroecology and agroforestry. We can improve how cultivated land is managed and limit use of fertilizer \u2026 which would help both biodiversity and the climate.\"</p><p>\"Protection alone is no longer enough; 70 percent of land is now in a degraded state,\" Parmesan adds. \"It is essential to put stronger policies in place for restoring ecosystems. That would enable us to recreate habitats for animals and plants, and the climate benefits would follow.\" For this to be successful a holistic approach is needed. \"There's no point planting trees purely to compensate for carbon emissions,\" Parmesan says. \"It needs to be done with respect for balance in the ecosystem.

This contribution is partly intended to benefit watersheds in California communities where Constellation Brands operates, contributing to the company's water replenishment targets first announced in April 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">$200,000 of the total amount was donated in February 2022 and will be used to support TNC's broader Global Resilient Watersheds program, which is focused on making watershed health a priority by investing in nature-based solutions - such as forest protection, regenerative agricultural practices, wetland restoration, and natural vegetation corridors along waterways - and aims to restore watershed health and revitalize degraded freshwater systems around the world.</p><p>The remaining $500,000 donation will be leveraged over two years in support of TNC's innovative dynamic water management programs in California. Drawing on two nature-based opportunities, the dynamic water management programs in California target the San Joaquin Valley and the Stockton/Sacramento watersheds - both located in communities where a number of Constellation's winery facilities and operations reside. These programs are designed to bring to life important proof of concept strategies for rebalancing water demand for people and nature that in turn may be implemented on a broader scale to seek to address water challenges across the State of California and elsewhere.</p><p>In addition to helping improve watershed health for the broader community, nature-based solutions implemented through the dynamic water management programs are expected to provide volumetric benefits toward Constellation's water replenishment goals. Between Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2025, Constellation is targeting to restore approximately 1.1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from watersheds, while improving accessibility and quality of water for communities where the company operates. To achieve this target, Constellation developed a strategy focused on water efficiency, watershed restoration, and water accessibility and quality.

(NYSE: STZ and STZ. B), a leading beverage alcohol company, announced today a two-year commitment of $700,000 in total contributions to The Nature Conservancy (TNC), which describes itself as \"one of the most effective and efficient environmental organizations in the world\" with a mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. This contribution is partly intended to benefit watersheds in California communities where Constellation Brands operates, contributing to the company's water replenishment targets first announced in April 2022. $200,000 of the total amount was donated in February 2022 and will be used to support TNC's broader Global Resilient Watersheds program, which is focused on making watershed health a priority by investing in nature-based solutions - such as forest protection, regenerative agricultural practices, wetland restoration, and natural vegetation corridors along waterways - and aims to restore watershed health and revitalize degraded freshwater systems around the world. The remaining $500,000 donation will be leveraged over two years in support of TNC's innovative dynamic water management programs in California. Drawing on two nature-based opportunities, the dynamic water management programs in California target the San Joaquin Valley and the Stockton/Sacramento watersheds - both located in communities where a number of Constellation's winery facilities and operations reside. These programs are designed to bring to life important proof of concept strategies for rebalancing water demand for people and nature that in turn may be implemented on a broader scale to seek to address water challenges across the State of California and elsewhere. In addition to helping improve watershed health for the broader community, nature-based solutions implemented through the dynamic water management programs are expected to provide volumetric benefits toward Constellation's water replenishment goals.

The Annual Review highlights examples in some of the company's fastest-growing categories. In Health Science, Nestl\u00e9 developed new nutritional solutions for diabetes, cardiovascular and other medical conditions. For example, Nutren GlucoSmart was launched in Malaysia and helps support healthy glucose levels. Nestl\u00e9 uses that same know-how to develop solutions for pets too. Pro Plan Cardio Care was launched in 2021 to slow the progression of heart disease in dogs. In coffee, the company discovered two new varieties that produce up to 50% higher yields per tree versus standard varieties and enable an up to 30% reduction in the carbon footprint on the farm. One of those varieties is now being grown by farmers in Latin America for use in Nescaf\u00e9.</p><p>Strong digital capabilities are an important growth driver, and Nestl\u00e9 focuses on providing consumers with holistic online brand experiences. The company grew its e-commerce sales by another 15.1%, increasing e-commerce's share of total Group sales to 14.3% in 2021. Nestl\u00e9 further deployed its connected operations technology last year, with more than 100 sites now benefitting from a more connected workforce, better visibility across the entire production process and local flexibility. In a year that saw supply chain constraints, Nestl\u00e9 was able to identify changes in demand and supply in real time and deal with issues much faster.</p><p>In the Creating Shared Value (CSV) section of the Annual Review and in the full CSV and Sustainability Report, Nestl\u00e9 explains how it is supporting the just transition towards climate-friendly and nature-positive food systems. The company is delivering on its climate roadmap and reports that it has passed peak carbon levels. For the last two consecutive years, Nestl\u00e9 has reduced its absolute greenhouse gas emissions, even while its business volume has grown significantly. Specifically, it has achieved a reduction of 4.0 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, for instance, by switching to renewable electricity, or encouraging the use of natural fertilizers in farming. And it has initiated removals of 9.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents through nature-based solutions within its value chain.</p><p>The full Annual Report contains Nestl\u00e9's<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WgBlbXRNRezp5LdVnziLVmqC5g0uNtVht3H-ga7TbQhCj9tC9VPrhRRgrhq1Atx32TzorUcCFRhRRN5aD8STeeJmXTQg6U-woJC1uKgekVZwa02vJxFZE1zbwfzfOoM4aff8dPpqZOwuHICpRcXceoKrdbFUL7al5jVB7q7TuBA=\">Annual Review (pdf, 17 Mb)</url>as well as the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=S6GUASzSf9u7jRMIFxJF1VJAXSUca76FT15jvU4B40qYaYjFIMmJYNcMXz8wXcFZqTCjzVcMON6Zzza5hW5C9MNkSLsTmMyhH96dIwuLpUugC30DaT86i6Yu5XqkaCf6O6gnv9HAcnAV_QPM68yqCK802s7LLNwIxe0JN07R6zqb14gDMumh9n9ge0KBMbs7QFpphMBcz7o-gdMNVhFgUCBtyMUTok0hqF0FvqlxTog=\">Corporate Governance &amp; Compensation Reports (pdf, 2 Mb)</url>and the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ePmm82rDAA1viVTdak4k8OREm9eLO0BksckarmKqMrbRU1Yi3nEiqyHKAsF54OqYdNk3NMcSwabOyHeNdqp1TXf8jvZZtDHNtt0FtROVq7g0bQWNEnFuZADUzQbw9U8QyMZ4Lwze_c42cYReaogHLbS60cgammp40YgyELeyV_xyliPK30gGmZzB9cAUtixs\">Financial Statements (pdf, 1 Mb)</url>, which were published on February 17, 2022.</p><p>Read more in the Annual Report and in the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZWhRfJnt3Rh9bVPuXVLSz_0-Jkt3gfrgpPJucQSToSQF031YPgzXzqvrgDq65Ux6Xf16MW15vACDW8pQ1ia5XnU--vW2hpCEizabSpMyOybvbO1UjmJY3-YqyHWi5tWXgyIQae-rc4yedCxZyj_kZ3IC3ngtqwvMMB_81fStD95CXgL2Eka3Q7onf4d8psFUkcgqIwdl_PhPxbDmCMg5045VAXWYJ_Z_YREqzRUnjWtC0oQ3YChydSI9lccbIjBA\">Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report (pdf, 16 Mb)</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contacts:</emphasis>Media:Christoph Meier\u00a0\u00a0Tel.: +41 21 924 2200<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9PIfoQub6I_NdaNhFbEVvP4NfIj1vMqSggBnPtCPCt3e5JCCp9zhcKg58oHen_6WCbAiyuISgDZ6p5rbClk019nz1WunEKhB9_IgU1NxlSXXe-3F0A1KHTpdFoyPkYrM\">mediarelations@nestle.com</url>Investors:Luca Borlini\u00a0\u00a0Tel.: +41 21 924 3509<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=p7QMSly33Wk0aRQ7Nb9FW4CFk-FH8eTNenalSPZBRnAgUWERwtC5DTkQI3XOOhYHTBL8HEIEOX-7kwktcXU-rQ==\">ir@nestle.com</url></p>", "publisher": "GlobeNewswire - English", "instances": ["The company is delivering on its climate roadmap and reports that it has passed peak carbon levels.

According to United Nations figures, nearly 80% of the planet's biodiversity is found on the territories of Indigenous Peoples and therefore, they are more concerned and able to respond and be actors in the resolution of climate and biodiversity crises. The alternative congress approach promotes a radical decolonial vision of nature conservation."]}, {"relevance_score": 584, "title": "Notice of 2022 AGM and Shell's Energy Transition Progress Report", "published": "2022-04-20", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">London, April 20, 2022</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHELL PLC</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOTICE OF 20</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANNUAL GENERAL MEETIN</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">G</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AND SHELL</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY TRANSITION</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REPORT</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell plc</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'s</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2022</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Annual General Meeting</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(\"AGM\")</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">scheduled to be a hybrid meeting, facilitating both physical and virtual</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ttendance</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Board requests shareholder support</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">for</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Company's annual</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">progress</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">on</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">its energy transition strategy</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shareholders</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">encouraged</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">to</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">vote in advance of the AGM</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">, but voting enabled during the meeting</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Shell plc (\"Shell\") posted its Notice of 2022 Annual General Meeting (the \"Notice\"), which can be viewed and downloaded from<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/agm\">www.shell.com/agm</url></emphasis>.

We are working hard to ensure the safety of our staff and contractors, and to support relief efforts. We have also announced our intention to withdraw from Russian oil and gas.</p><p>As well as being a human tragedy, the war has led to rising energy prices and uncertainty about supplies.</p><p>This extreme disruption in global energy markets has shown that affordable, secure, and reliable energy cannot be taken as a given. It must be protected and managed, through international co-operation: companies, governments and wider society working together. This co-operation includes working with our shareholders and maintaining their support.</p><p>Shell will play a leading role as the world's energy systems change. We will continue to supply the oil and gas that people need today. As one of the world's largest suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), we can ship natural gas to where it is needed most. At the same time, we are accelerating the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy, which is at the heart of our strategy.</p><p>Essentially, an accelerated transition is the best way to ensure security of energy supplies. It is also the best way to help people in some parts of the world who do not yet have access to energy, which is essential for a better quality of life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis>We firmly believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The actions Shell takes over the coming years, and our progress against our short- and medium-term targets, will be crucial steps to ensure that we become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>In the first year of our Powering Progress strategy, we have laid the foundations for success. We have taken critical investment decisions in the production of low-carbon fuels, solar and wind power, and hydrogen. We have made significant changes to our Upstream and refinery portfolios, we reshaped the organisation and we simplified the company and its share structure. We have formed partnerships with some of the world's biggest companies in sectors from aviation to road transport and technology.</p><p>In 2021, we added an ambitious new target to halve absolute emissions from our operations and the energy we buy to run them by 2030 (Scope 1 and 2), compared with 2016 levels and on a net basis. We are well on our way with an 18% reduction by the end of 2021.</p><p>For comparison, we estimate that global energy- and fossil-related CO2emissions actually rose by 2.4% in the period between the end of 2016 and the end of 2021, based on International Energy Agency (IEA) and other data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Change in demand</emphasis>We believe that for the world to decarbonise, a dramatic change in demand for energy is just as critical as changes to supply. That is why an essential part of Shell's strategy is working with our customers across different sectors to reduce emissions.</p><p>We are helping our customers to identify and use low- and zero-carbon alternatives to the energy products they have used for many decades: renewable electricity and hydrogen to power homes, cars, trucks, businesses, and industry; biofuels for cars, trucks and planes; LNG for power, trucks and ships; and carbon capture and storage and nature-based carbon offsets to deal with any remaining emissions.</p><p>This is not only the right approach for the world. It also makes good business sense. We see great business opportunities for Shell in the fast-growing low- and zero-carbon markets where we are well positioned to provide the different products and solutions our customers need.</p><p>We are leading the way in new technologies that will help to decarbonise our operations, and to reduce emissions for our customers. Our scientists are developing new ways to store hydrogen safely, including underground, for example, which will be critical to ensure secure, large-scale supplies of hydrogen to our industrial customers in the future. And our engineers are designing LNG projects which are powered by renewable electricity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Remuneration</emphasis>We included progress in the energy transition in the calculation of the annual bonus for almost all Shell's employees in 2021. Now we are going further. From 2022, we have extended how we measure progress to cover three key themes; reducing emissions from our operations, sales of low- and zero-carbon products and partnering with others to decarbonise road transport.</p><p>In 2019, we were the first major energy company to include an energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan for senior executives. This has vested for the first time at 180%, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stronger and more profitable</emphasis>Last year, 89% of Shell's shareholders voted in favour of our energy transition strategy. We are implementing that strategy, and this year we are asking shareholders to vote on our progress, as we will do every year until 2050. The next energy transition strategy update for an advisory vote is in 2024 and we will give another update on our progress next year.</p><p>Securing shareholder support as we implement our Powering Progress strategy is good governance. The vote on our progress towards our targets and plans is purely advisory and will not be binding on our shareholders. The legal responsibility for Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>When I look at what we have achieved in 2021, and our plans for the years ahead, I believe that Shell will become stronger and more profitable by providing the low- and zero-carbon energy products and services that our customers need. That is good for our shareholders. It is good for our customers. It is also good for the world's climate goals and the planet.</p><p>The continued support of our shareholders is critical for us to become a net-zero emissions energy business and a leader in the energy transition. We believe that Shell's energy transition strategy is in the best interests of our shareholders as a whole and wider society.</p><p>The Board recommends that you vote in favour of Resolution 20 in support of the progress that Shell has made in its energy transition strategy over the past year as described in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S INTRODUCTION</emphasis></p><p>Ben van Beurden, CEO, Shell plc</p><p>In a time of great uncertainty, it is vital that our long-term energy transition strategy remains on track. This report shows the strong progress we have made towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>It will take bold moves for Shell to achieve net zero. In 2021, we took some significant steps. We completed one of the biggest restructurings in our history, making us a more agile company. We decided to simplify our share structure, and moved Shell's headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets</emphasis>In this Energy Transition Progress Report, we show our progress against our climate targets in the year since our shareholders overwhelmingly supported our energy transition strategy.</p><p>We are making significant progress in a long-term plan. Crucially, we set a new target to reduce absolute emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2021, we had achieved a reduction of 18%. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2-3% by the end of 2021, also compared with 2016.</p><p>Now our targets start to get more ambitious. We are working towards a 9-12% reduction in net carbon intensity by 2024, and a 20% reduction by 2030. To put our targets into context, the International Energy Agency Net Zero by 2050 scenario suggests that the transport sector, which accounts for most of Shell's emissions, needs to see a reduction in net carbon intensity of 18% by 2030.</p><p>From today, our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is no longer conditional on society's progress, marking a further step forwards. This reflects the leading role we will play in the energy transition. We must find ways to be ahead of society where we can, while remaining a successful and profitable company.</p><p>As we have seen from the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to take urgent action to meet its climate goals. While countries, companies and individuals are making significant changes, there is still a risk that the world will not achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. This could mean that Shell would find it hard to meet its 2050 target as well. We are rising to that challenge and will demonstrate over time how we will reach our goal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working sector by sector</emphasis>We are investing in low- and zero-carbon products such as renewable electricity, hydrogen, biofuels and chemicals. We are building a leading hydrogen business, and now operate 10% of total electrolyser capacity in the world. We are already one of the world's largest producers of biofuels through our joint venture in Brazil. And last year we started building one of Europe's biggest biofuels facilities.</p><p>Crucially, we are working sector by sector to identify the low- and zero-carbon products and services that our customers need. And we are laying the foundations for future expansion by building capacity and expertise. At the beginning of 2022, for example, with our joint-venture partners, we won bids to develop 5 gigawatts of floating wind power in the UK, enough to power 6 million homes. That is more than double the number of homes in Scotland.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investing in net zero</emphasis>Our Upstream business continues to provide the oil and gas the world needs today, and generates the returns to fund distributions to shareholders and our investments in the energy transition. Our production and sales of oil and gas will decrease in the coming years as we transform our business.</p><p>At the same time, our investments in the energy system of the future will increase significantly. By 2025, we expect around half of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services including biofuels, hydrogen, power, charging for electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, chemicals and lubricants. In 2022, we expect that around one third of our total expenditure will be on these low- and zero- carbon products and services.</p><p>Our planned investments in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK put us among the leading investors in the energy transition there. In the UK, for example, we plan to invest \u00a320-25 billion ($26-33 billion) over the next ten years, mostly in low- and zero-carbon projects including offshore wind, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles, subject to Board approval.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shareholder engagement</emphasis>A central part of our Powering Progress strategy is delivering value for our shareholders. We have made good progress here too. In 2021, we produced a strong financial performance and announced an $8.5 billion share buyback programme in the first half of 2022.</p><p>We will continue our dialogue with shareholders as Shell transforms and evolves. It is important that we are transparent about our progress in the energy transition. From the first quarter of 2022, we intend to publish more information about the profitability of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business, something that investors have asked for.</p><p>We believe that our strategy delivers secure and reliable energy that will accelerate the energy transition and deliver strong profits and returns to shareholders. I ask our shareholders to vote for Resolution 20 in support of our progress towards our targets and milestones as we accelerate towards net zero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON PERFORMANCE AT A GLANCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS SUMMARY</emphasis></p><p>We are transforming into a net-zero emissions energy business. In 2021 and the beginning of 2022 we:</p><p>Reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 18%, and reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2.5%, both by the end of 2021 compared with 2016.Formed more than 50 collaborations with other leading companies aiming to be at the forefront of the energy transition. Continued to build a material power business. We had 1.6 million retail customers worldwide by the end of February 2022, compared with 900,000 at the end of 2020. We have 4.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable generation capacity in operation, under construction and/or committed for sale. We have a further 38 GW of renewable generation capacity in our pipeline of future projects.Expanded our hydrogen business. We have started production from 30 megawatts (MW) of electrolysers that can produce around 4,300 tonnes a year of decarbonised hydrogen. We are looking to take final investment decisions on 10 times this capacity in 2022. We own and operate 10% of global electrolyser capacity today.Took a final investment decision on a facility in the Netherlands to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year. This facility will be one of the largest in Europe to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel made from waste, and is expected to start production in 2024.Continued to build the infrastructure that our customers will need as they move to low- and zero-carbon energy.Expanded our electric vehicle charging network to almost 90,000 charge points at the end of 2021, from around 60,000 in 2020.Increased the number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) refuelling sites in Europe and increased the number of sites for hydrogen refuelling in Europe, North America and China.Announced our ambition for SAF to make up at least 10% of our aviation fuel sales by 2030.Expanded our LNG bunkering operations, including the world's first bio-LNG bunkering, to help to reduce emissions from the marine sector. We also worked with others on programmes to develop hydrogen fuel cell propulsion for ships.Worked with customers across sectors such as commercial, light industry and technology to decarbonise their energy use by providing renewable electricity.Developed partnerships in the heavy industry sector to explore how hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be used to reduce global carbon emissions.Invested in CCS. We have two CCS projects in operation and more than 10 under development. Retired around 6 million tonnes of nature-based credits, excluding trading activities, in 2021.Supported climate-related government policies that advance the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OUR PERFORMANCE</emphasis></p><p>Read in more detail about our performance against our climate targets and how we are working to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>09\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NET CARBON INTENSITY</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDUCING OUR ABSOLUTE SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS</emphasis>To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we are transforming how we produce energy as we continue to meet growing demand.</p><p>In October 2021, we set a new target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.</p><p>We have identified six main ways to decarbonise our operations:</p><p>making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also divesting assets and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining five refineries into low-carbon energy and chemicals parks; using more renewable electricity to power our operations;developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities; and, if required, using nature-based solutions to offset any remaining emissions from our operations.</p><p>The chart below illustrates our current plans to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS IN 2021</emphasis>By the end of 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control to 68 million tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent, an 18% reduction compared with 2016, our base year. This shows significant progress towards achieving our target of a 50% reduction by 2030.</p><p>In 2021, we improved energy efficiency across our assets. For example, we implemented a project to reduce power requirements for gas compression at our QGC natural gas project in Australia. Most of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions came from our Downstream business, in particular from our refining activities. Portfolio changes, such as the sale of the Martinez and Puget Sound refineries in the USA, and the transformation of our Bukom refinery in Singapore into a low-carbon energy and chemicals park, also helped to reduce emissions from our operations. Shell's Annual Report and Accounts provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p>Methane emissions are included in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting. In 2021, we reduced total methane emissions from our operations by 18% to 55,000 tonnes, compared with 67,000 tonnes in 2020. In 2021, our methane emissions intensity averaged 0.06% for assets with gas available for sale, well within our target to maintain less than 0.2% by 2025.</p><p>In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine gas flaring from our Upstream operations to 2025 from 2030. In 2021, routine flaring from our Upstream operations fell to 0.2 million tonnes of hydrocarbons from 0.3 million tonnes of hydrocarbons in the previous year. Despite this, our overall flaring increased from 0.8 million tonnes of hydrocarbons to 1.0 million tonnes because of non-routine flaring, mainly as a result of operational issues in Nigeria. Shell's Sustainability Report provides more information about flaring.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NET</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTENSITY</emphasis></p><p>We are working with our customers to provide the energy they need today, and to accelerate the energy transition. This means changing our portfolio of products as we provide low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>If our customers are not able to use these products, we will help them to store and offset remaining emissions through carbon capture and storage and by providing high-quality, nature-based solutions. By 2050, we will no longer serve customers who have unmitigated carbon emissions.</p><p>To achieve net zero, we must reduce emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, to zero. We must also cut emissions from the use of energy products sold by Shell (Scope 3), by reducing sales of oil and gas products and growing sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.</p><p>We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress, which measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. Crucially, it reflects both a reduction in sales of oil and gas products, and growth in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.</p><p>Reducing net carbon intensity encourages us to work with our customers in sectors such as aviation and shipping to decarbonise their use of energy, while still providing the oil and gas they need today. And, as an intensity metric, it measures the true transformation that is happening in the company as we implement our energy transition strategy.</p><p>Other metrics, such as a simple total carbon emissions metric, would reflect how our sales of oil and gas products are shrinking, but would not provide information on how we are changing our mix of products.</p><p>We believe that our total absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes, and our total absolute emissions were 1.4 gigatonnes in 2021. We are working to reduce them to net zero by 2050. This is the same as a 100% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALIGNED WITH PARIS</emphasis>We believe our targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00c5\u00e3C above pre-industrial levels. There is no standard methodology to determine how to align companies' plans and targets with the goal of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>We studied a subset of IPCC scenarios that achieve that goal and were focused on earlier action and placed less reliance on the use of carbon sinks. From this subset, we calculated the range of carbon intensity pathways over time. We set our targets to fall within these pathways.</p><p>Our calculations show that the net carbon intensity of the energy mix will need to fall by around 15-35% by 2030. Shell has set a target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 20% by 2030.</p><p>[A] We measure net carbon intensity using our Net Carbon Footprint methodology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDUCING CARBON INTENSITY</emphasis>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing our sales of low-carbon products and services. The chart below illustrates how this change in our product mix could help us to achieve our target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 20% by 2030.</p><p>Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products.</p><p>Electricity sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable electricity. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products.</p><p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Nature-based solutions offset carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and steel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON INTENSITY PROGRESS</emphasis>We achieved our short-term target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 2-3% compared with 2016, the base year, with a 2.5% reduction in 2021. We achieved this reduction by shifting our portfolio to lower-carbon energy products such as natural gas, power and biofuels, which now make up 55% of our total energy sales, compared with 46% in 2016.</p><p>In 2021, Shell's net carbon intensity was 77 gCO\u2082e/MJ, a 2.7% increase from the previous year. This increase was largely because we made a change in our methodology to better calculate the carbon intensity of our electricity sales. This approach distinguishes between the certified renewable electricity we purchase, electricity from our own generation, or purchased through a power purchase agreement, and electricity purchased from the grid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SECTORAL DECARBONISATION</emphasis></p><p>Read how Shell is working with customers, sector by sector, to help to transform the energy system.</p><p>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUILDING NEW SUPPLY CHAINS19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CHANGING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM</emphasis></p><p>To help to transform the energy system, Shell is working with customers, sector by sector. We have formed more than 50 collaborations with other leading companies aiming to be at the forefront of the energy transition.</p><p>Our strategy is to:</p><p>provide more electricity, while also shifting the power system to renewable energy;develop alternative zero- and low-carbon solutions to traditional fuels, including biofuels, hydrogen, and other zero- and low- carbon gases; andaddress any remaining emissions with decarbonisation solutions such as carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUILDING NEW SUPPLY CHAINS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELECTRICITY</emphasis>We are building a material power business. By 2030, we aim to sell around 560 terawatt hours of electricity per year. This is more than twice the electricity we sell today.</p><p>We provide electricity and smart energy solutions to residential, commercial and industrial customers through direct electricity sales, and services such as electricity storage. We had 1.6 million retail customers worldwide by the end of February 2022, compared with 900,000 at the end of 2020. This increase is largely because we added more than 500,000 retail customers in the UK in 2021, and around 185,000 retail customers In Australia following our acquisition of PowerShop in 2022. Our largest markets for commercial and industrial customers are in Australia and the USA.</p><p>In addition to the investments we have made in building our customer base, we are also investing in building our generation capacity. We have 4.7 GW of renewable generation capacity in operation, under construction and/or committed for sale. We have a further 38 GW of renewable generation capacity in our pipeline of future projects.</p><p>We have added to our renewable generation capabilities by acquiring Savion, a US-based solar and energy storage specialist; Solar-Konzept Italia, an Italian solar specialist; and WestWind, a wind specialist based in Australia.</p><p>Shell is one of the leading developers of floating wind farms in the world with prototypes, pilot farms and commercial-scale projects in development in France, Ireland, Norway, Scotland and South Korea.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYDROGEN</emphasis>We are expanding our hydrogen projects to serve sectors such as road freight, steel and cement. These projects include the production, storage and shipping of hydrogen.</p><p>As we grow, we are using Shell's integrated businesses to connect the different parts of the hydrogen system, from offshore wind to power the electrolysers that produce hydrogen, to using hydrogen in our energy and chemicals parks and eventually, supplying it through our retail network.</p><p>We are increasing our capacity, investing in infrastructure and helping to increase the scale and the adoption of hydrogen across different sectors. We have increased our total electrolyser capacity from 2 MW to 30 MW, 10% of the global capacity of installed electrolysers in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p><p>We have added a 20 MW electrolyser in China, which at the time was the largest in the world, and a 10 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser in Germany, the biggest of its kind in Europe. The electrolysers can produce 3,000 tonnes and 1,300 tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen a year respectively.</p><p>In 2022, with our partners, we plan to take final investment decisions on electrolysers with a total capacity of 300 MW. In the Netherlands, we plan to build a 200 MW electrolyser, which is expected to start operations by 2024 and to produce around 20,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year. In Germany, we plan to take a final investment decision on a 100 MW electrolyser in 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIOFUELS</emphasis>The transport sector accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the IEA. Biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biodiesel, bioethanol and renewable natural gas are low-carbon fuels which can be used by customers to reduce their emissions without having to change their airplanes, cars, trucks, or ships.</p><p>In 2021, around 9.1 billion litres of biofuels were blended into Shell's fuels worldwide, around 5.8% of global biofuels consumption, according to figures from the IEA.</p><p>Shell and our Brazilian joint venture Ra\u00edzen, in which Shell has a 44% share, are together among the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels for the mobility sector. Ra\u00edzen produced 2.5 billion litres of first-generation ethanol in 2021, which is around 2.5% of global ethanol production, according to the IEA. It also acquired Biosev, adding a further 50% to its production capacity. And it took a final investment decision on its second-generation cellulosic ethanol facility, which will have a capacity of 80 million litres and is expected to start operations in 2023.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell took a final investment decision on a facility to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year. This facility will be one of the largest in Europe to produce SAF and renewable diesel made from waste, and is expected to start production in 2024. We are considering further investments to produce SAF at our energy and chemicals parks in Germany and Singapore.</p><p>As well as liquid biofuels, we are developing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG). Our newly operational Junction City RNG plant in Oregon is the largest plant in the USA to produce natural gas from agricultural residues, with an annual capacity of 736,000 million British thermal units.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONVENTIONAL</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FUELS</emphasis>The world will need less oil and gas as it moves to a low- and zero-carbon energy system. This transition is reflected in Shell's changing portfolio. In 2021, our oil production was 3.9% lower than in the previous year, as a result of divestments and natural decline. It was 7.6% lower than in 2019, when our oil production peaked. We expect our oil production to decline by an average of 1-2% a year to 2030.</p><p>We plan to reduce annual spending on exploration to around $1.5 billion between 2021 and 2025. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025.</p><p>We are transforming our refineries into five energy and chemicals parks which will produce low-carbon and synthetic fuels, as well as bitumen, lubricants and chemicals. The transformation of our refineries will help us to reduce production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030, from around 91 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 2020 to 45 mtpa by 2030. In 2021, we reduced our production of traditional fuels to 71 mtpa.</p><p>Liquified natural gas (LNG) plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a lower- carbon alternative. We are adding around 7 mtpa of new LNG capacity, which is under construction and expected to be on stream around the middle of the decade. This includes our LNG Canada joint venture and our interest in a new LNG processing unit in Nigeria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANGING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS</emphasis></p><p>A critical part of our success in the energy transition will be our ability to work sector by sector with customers and stakeholders. By listening to our customers, learning from them and working with them, we can understand what they value and need as the world moves towards a lower-carbon future. We aim to use such insights to profitably provide the low-carbon products and services they will want to buy.</p><p>We are also working with those operating in each sector, and with policymakers, to increase ambition around reducing emissions, better enable changes to infrastructure, and provide favourable conditions for investing in lower-carbon options. We are joining coalitions focused on decarbonising sectors and working with others to produce reports that identify and show pathways to reduce emissions in some of the sectors that are hardest to abate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERSONAL MOBILITY</emphasis>Shell is the world's largest mobility retailer, with more than 46,000 service stations operating in more than 80 markets. We believe the biggest opportunity to decarbonise our portfolio is by offering more low-carbon alternatives such as biofuels, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles.</p><p>In 2021, Shell operated almost 90,000 electric vehicle charge points, up from around 60,000 in the previous year. We aim to increase this to more than 500,000 by 2025, and to 2.5 million by 2030. That is around 7% of the expected number of charge points in the world by 2030, according to the IEA. In January 2021, we acquired ubitricity, a European provider of on-street charging for electric vehicles through lamp posts.</p><p>We are also expanding our network of hydrogen refuelling stations. By the end of 2021, there were around 50 hydrogen refuelling stations at Shell-branded outlets in Europe and North America where drivers can fill up their vehicles with hydrogen fuel.</p><p>In Germany, we are a member of the H2 Mobility joint venture to develop a nationwide network of hydrogen refuelling stations for passenger cars. The venture operates more than 90 stations across Germany.</p><p>We offer carbon credits to passenger car drivers who want to offset the life-cycle emissions of the fuel they buy from Shell. We have made this offer available to passenger car drivers at more than 3,100 retail sites in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. In 2021, around 49 million litres of fuel sales were offset, accounting for 1% of our total volumes sold in markets where we have an offset programme.</p><p>Shell supports the European Commission's proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport by 13% by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROAD FREIGHT</emphasis>The road freight sector will be able to use battery electric power and hydrogen to get to net zero, as well as biogas, biofuels and liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in trucks and buses. In 2021, we added 18 LNG refuelling stations to our network, which now consists of 44 sites across Europe.</p><p>In 2022, we started construction of our bio-LNG liquefaction plant in Rheinland, Germany, which will provide bio-LNG to 4,000-5,000 LNG trucks by 2023. We also started offering bio-LNG blended with regular LNG to all our customers in the Netherlands.</p><p>We are working with partners to increase the adoption of hydrogen and electric trucks. We signed an agreement with Daimler Truck AG, for example, to encourage the adoption of hydrogen trucks in Europe. Shell aims to build 150 hydrogen refuelling stations and supply around 5,000 Mercedes-Benz heavy-duty trucks with hydrogen by 2030.</p><p>In the USA, through our subsidiary Shell Recharge Solutions, we started providing electric charging infrastructure for trucks as part of a project led by Volvo Group and South Coast Air Quality Management District.</p><p>We offer nature-based carbon credits to fleet customers in 17 countries. This enables them to offset the emissions generated by the extraction, refining, distribution and use of the Shell fuel they buy.</p><p>We support policies and incentives in the European Union (EU) that would enable all new medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2040, to help the EU to meet its 2050 carbon neutrality goal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AVIATION</emphasis>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the aviation sector's most viable option for reducing its emissions in the short to medium term.</p><p>SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of the world's consumption of aviation fuel. Currently, Shell supplies SAF made by others. From 2024, we will start supplying customers with SAF produced at our Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In September 2021, we announced our ambition to produce around 2 million tonnes of SAF a year by 2025 and to have at least 10% of our global aviation fuel sales as SAF by 2030.</p><p>We are working with Rolls-Royce to test 100% SAF in airplane engines for the first time. In 2022, Shell was the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore where we have established the supply chain, from blending to distribution, for the Asian market.</p><p>We support tax incentives to help to drive down the cost of SAF around the world. We are advocating that the EU's 2030 target for the use of SAF doubles from 5% to 10%, and for governments and policymakers to encourage the International Civil Aviation Organization to adopt a net-zero emissions target for 2050.</p><p>The aviation sector needs verifiable, high-quality nature-based solutions (NBS) to offset emissions, and we are offering these to airline customers such as Etihad Airways. Shell also sees a potential opportunity for hydrogen in aviation and we have taken a stake in ZeroAvia, a developer of hydrogen-electric aircraft.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINE</emphasis>The marine sector, like aviation, is hard to decarbonise because of the long life cycle of vessels and high upfront investment costs. Low-carbon solutions include hydrogen and ammonia in the long term, and LNG, biofuels and methanol in the short term. We are developing an initial portfolio of biofuels for shipping, and in 2021, we performed the first bio-LNG bunkering trial in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p><p>We have completed more than 400 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations in seven countries and eight ports. In 2021, we carried out the first LNG bunkering operations in Gibraltar and Singapore. We are aiming to double the size of our LNG bunkering network by the mid-2020s, to around 15 major ports on key international trading routes. Shell is a member of a coalition that is calling for at least 5% zero-emissions fuel in international shipping by 2030, and for commercially viable zero- emissions vessels on deep-sea trade routes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIGHT INDUSTRY AND COMMERCIAL</emphasis>We serve customers across the industrial and commercial sectors where there is growing demand for decarbonisation products and services. More than 2,000 companies and organisations have made commitments to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. We are now forming strategic alliances with big multinational companies such as Microsoft and Amazon, helping them and us to achieve our net-zero aims.</p><p>For example, we are supplying Microsoft with renewable energy as part of our strategic alliance launched in 2020. In 2021, we advanced this partnership by signing several agreements to supply more than 500 MW of renewable energy, helping Microsoft to meet its goal of using 100% renewable energy by 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEAVY INDUSTRY</emphasis>The heavy industrial sector includes utilities, process industries, such as chemicals, refining and industrial gases, and heavy manufacturing industries such as steel, cement, glass, and paper and pulp.</p><p>It is challenging to decarbonise these sectors rapidly because they involve complex processes and the required technologies are not available at scale. They also tend to involve processes that require high temperatures, dense energy storage and, in many cases, chemical reactions that produce CO2as part of the production process.</p><p>In 2021, we entered into several agreements with leading businesses to reduce emissions from heavy industry. We are exploring how hydrogen can help to reduce emissions from the steel sector, for example, in partnership with steel producers Baosteel in</p><p>China and Bluescope in Australia. Together with companies such as Pan-United Corporation in Singapore, we are developing opportunities to produce low-carbon concrete products.</p><p>In industrial hubs where we have low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, including in the Netherlands and Singapore, we are working with other companies to build the infrastructure required to support the decarbonisation of several facilities at one time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE</emphasis>Shell's ambition is to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce emissions where there are no currently scalable low-carbon alternatives. We seek to have access to an additional 25 million tonnes a year of CCS capacity by 2035 - equal to 25 CCS facilities the size of our Quest site in Canada.</p><p>In 2021, Shell's operating costs for and investment in CCS opportunities amounted to around $146 million. Shell's share of captured and stored CO2was 0.4 million tonnes in 2021. By the end of 2021, our Quest CCS operations in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 6.5 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron), which started operating in August 2019, had stored more than 5 million tonnes of CO2by the end of 2021. Gorgon is the largest CCS operation in the world.</p><p>We have taken a final investment decision on the Northern Lights project in Norway which includes the transport and permanent storage of CO2in a reservoir beneath the sea. The first phase of this project will provide more than 0.25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CCS capacity by 2025. In total, we have two CCS projects in operation and more than 10 under development.</p><p>Shell's CANSOLV CO2system is one of the leading large-scale, post-combustion, carbon capture technologies in commercial operation. After capture, the CO2is released as a pure stream that can be stored or used in other processes. In 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, Shell's CANSOLV technology was selected for six projects with the potential to capture a combined 12 million tonnes of CO2a year [A]. These projects are in the UK and the USA and span the refining, chemicals and power sectors.</p><p>Read more about our CCS projects at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ccs\">www.shell.com/ccs</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS</emphasis>Carbon credits generated by high-quality nature-based projects may be used by Shell and our customers to offset emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and offset.</p><p>Shell is investing in the development of high-quality nature-based projects, which are independently audited for the quality and quantity of credits. In 2021, we invested $26 million in nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and the prevention of landscape degradation and destruction. We also invested $11 million in cookstove projects, which reduce the emissions from households traditionally using open fires for cooking.</p><p>In 2021, we expanded our offer of carbon credits to drivers and business customers who wish to compensate for the life-cycle CO2-equivalent emissions generated by their use of the Shell fuel they buy. We have made this offer available to our fleet customers in 17 countries and to retail customers at more than 3,100 service stations in Austria, Canada, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK.</p><p>We retired around 6 million credits in 2021, which we estimate is the equivalent to 2.9 million cars being taken off the road for one year. Of these, 5.1 million credits were retired in association with the use of our energy products by our customers, with the remainder associated with the production of synthetic lubricants and emissions from Shell's business travel.</p><p>It is important that nature-based carbon credits are of high quality. In November 2021, Shell published a report 'Ensuring high- quality nature-based carbon credits' that sets out our expectations and approach to quality across our portfolio of nature-based solutions.</p><p>We expect the market for high-quality credits to grow sharply during the next decade. We expect to retire around 120 million credits in 2030.</p><p>[A] This is shared as an example of how Shell is developing and using technology to capture CO2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK</emphasis></p><p>Read about our planned total expenditure and expected returns across our businesses.</p><p>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INVESTING IN NET ZERO</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS</emphasis></p><p>Shell's financial strength and access to capital give us the ability to provide significant shareholder returns and to profitably transform our portfolio to meet our target of achieving net-zero emissions. They also allow us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets and to continue to provide the energy the world needs.</p><p>We are stepping up our investments in low- and zero-carbon energy where we see good opportunities for growth and strong returns. From the first quarter of 2022, we will report separately on the performance of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business, which includes our integrated power, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and nature-based solutions businesses. We will also report separately on the performance of our Marketing business, which includes charging for electric vehicles and biofuels. We expect to provide more details on the performance of these activities as they grow.</p><p>We set out our planned total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) [A], and expected returns, across our businesses. Our strategy is to:</p><p>Increase our investments in Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions, with expected returns of 15-25% and more than 10% respectively.These businesses include our service stations, sales of gasoline and diesel, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. They focus on working with our customers to accelerate the transition to net zero and are the foundations for the future businesses in Shell.Maintain our investments in our Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products businesses, with expected returns of 10-15% and 14-18% respectively.These businesses make and sell the products needed to enable the energy transition. They produce sustainable cash flows and give us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our low-carbon businesses. Limit our investments in our Upstream oil and gas business, with expected returns of 20-25%. Our Upstream business helps to provide the vital supply of oil and natural gas that the world needs today, and generates the cash and returns needed to fund our shareholder distributions and the transformation of our portfolio.</p><p>Our targeted returns consider risks and uncertainties associated with our investments, and the scale of spending that is required to develop opportunities. For example, our expected returns in our Upstream business reflect the costs of exploration, feasibility studies and construction, as well as risks linked to commodity prices.</p><p>In 2021, our cash capital expenditure was $20 billion and our operating expenses were $36 billion. The table below shows how we expect several key metrics, including total expenditure, to evolve over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2021 delivery and outlook</emphasis></p><p>[A]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Including exploration expenses.[B]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Excluding 2% CFFO from the Corporate segment.[C]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assumes Brent price of $60 per barrel.</p><p>[A] Please refer to the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 for the definitions of cash capital expenditure and operating expenses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTING IN NET ZERO</emphasis></p><p>We are significantly increasing our expenditure on low- and zero-carbon energy, helping both Shell and its customers to meet their climate targets.</p><p>In 2025, we expect around 50% of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services across all our businesses. Most of that 50% is on low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels and hydrogen, power, nature-based solutions, carbon capture and storage and convenience retail, including charging for electric vehicles. The remainder is on our chemicals and lubricants businesses, which do not produce energy products and do not create carbon emissions when used by our customers.</p><p>When measuring total expenditure, we focus on both cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure so that we can capture the total costs associated with accelerating the transition by working with our customers and in coalitions, key parts of our strategy.</p><p>Capital expenditure also relates to spending on acquiring and maintaining assets and equipment. It does not reflect the fact that some of our Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses are less capital intensive compared with our Upstream activities, and have higher operating costs.</p><p>We believe that the only true way to measure our progress in the energy transition is not just to look at changing spending patterns, but also to look at our progress against our net carbon intensity targets. In the short term, by the end of 2024, we are aiming for a reduction in our net carbon intensity of 9-12% compared with 2016, which is a significant step up on our 2-3% target for 2021. We have achieved this target with a 2.5% reduction compared with our 2016 base year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POLICIES AND GOVERNANCE</emphasis></p><p>Read about our climate-related governance and policy engagement, and our disclosures linked to climate standards and benchmarks.</p><p>27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE GOVERNANCE28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A JUST TRANSITION29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT</emphasis></p><p>We aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around climate-related policy engagement. We set out our approach, policy positions, examples of our advocacy, and reviews of our memberships of industry associations on our website (see <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>).</p><p>In October 2021, we published our updated global climate and energy transition policy positions to reflect our Powering Progress strategy and our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. We believe that by advocating these positions as we transform our business, we support the energy transition and the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p>Our detailed policy positions serve as a global framework for Shell's advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, coalitions, and other stakeholders globally, regionally and within countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS</emphasis>We have continued to work to ensure our memberships of industry associations support our climate-related policy positions. We have seen positive signs such as wider support for the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing and the regulation of methane emissions. We are clear that our memberships should strengthen and not undermine our support of the goal of the Paris Agreement and the global drive to achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>We published our latest Industry Associations Climate Review in 2021, and a progress update in April 2022. This provides an update on industry associations where we found some misalignment and material misalignment, details of our climate lobbying in the European Union and the USA, and information on our payments to 36 associations. We will publish our next Industry Associations Climate Review in 2023 and plan to use our updated climate and energy transition policy positions as the basis of our assessments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE GOVERNANCE</emphasis></p><p>Our climate governance begins with the Board's approval of our energy transition strategy and oversight of its implementation and delivery. In 2021, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year when reviewing and guiding our energy transition strategy, assessing the risk management policies in place, and challenging and endorsing the business plans and budgets, including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. In 2021, the Board convened on 12 occasions and continued to regularly oversee the Powering Progress strategy and net-zero initiatives, including at the Board Strategy Day in June 2021.</p><p>An important part of Shell's governance is to help manage our transition to a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We have further aligned remuneration with progress in the energy transition, by making changes to the annual bonus scorecard, which helps determine bonus outcomes for most Shell employees including Executive Committee members.</p><p>The progress in the energy transition measure, which makes up 15% of the annual bonus scorecard, had previously focused entirely on managing and reducing Shell's operational emissions. We decided to widen this to take account of our success at selling lower-carbon products and working with our customers to advance decarbonisation.</p><p>As a result, from 2022, the energy transition measure will be split into three components, each accounting for 5% of the scorecard:</p><p>selling low- and zero-carbon products;reducing Shell's operational emissions (our Scope 1 and 2 emissions); andpartnering to decarbonise (to be measured in terms of our progress in rolling out our electric vehicle charging network).</p><p>We also decided to introduce a customer excellence component in the operational excellence measure on the annual bonus scorecard. This is because our Powering Progress strategy places great emphasis on building strong customer relationships to help transform Shell in the energy transition.</p><p>In 2019, we were the first major energy company to include an energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan for senior executives. This has vested for the first time at 180%, based on performance between 2019 and the end of 2021, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future.</p><p>For further details of Shell's governance structure, see the Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A JUST TRANSITION</emphasis></p><p>Shell's Powering Progress strategy has four main goals in support of our purpose. These goals include Powering Lives, which Shell does through its products and activities, and by supporting an inclusive society.</p><p>Shell supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, which recognises the importance of a just transition. A just transition means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.</p><p>We aim to publish our just transition guiding principles in the next year. We have joined two collaborations to help to inform our approach. In 2021, we became a member of IPIECA's Just Transition Task Force, which aims to help companies to develop their approaches to a just transition and share good practice. In January 2022, we joined Energy for a Just Transition, a coalition created by the non-governmental organisations Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and The B Team.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting staff</emphasis>In 2021, around 1,700 Shell employees completed about 2,300 courses related to new skills needed for the energy transition. These included courses on hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fair pay</emphasis>In 2022, Shell published its Fair Pay principles to increase transparency of our pay policies for staff. We also expect our suppliers to provide their employees with wages and benefits that meet or exceed the national legal standards.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES</emphasis>Shell welcomes the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends that companies disclose information in four areas: governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets.

The table below shows how Shell was assessed in the March 2022 Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark.</p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climateaction100.org/whos-involved/companies/\">https://www.climateaction100.org/whos-involved/companies/</url> n/a = not applicable</p><p>The Climate Action 100+ benchmark uses assessments by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI). In its assessment, TPI highlights that it has recalculated Shell's net carbon intensity according to its own methodology. It also highlights that Shell has set further targets to reduce its net carbon intensity, but they were not included in this assessment as it was not possible to make them consistent with TPI's methodology.</p><p>We were disappointed with this outcome as we had engaged with CA100+ and TPI to understand the differences in the methodologies used. We had clarified our 2035 and 2050 targets on that basis. However, we will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets are reflected in the next Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark. We believe that this could result in a change to the Shell assessment to 'meets all criteria' for at least five indicators, 'partial, meets some criteria' for three indicators and one 'does not meet any criteria' rating for capital allocation.</p><p>As described in this report, we continue to believe that total expenditure, as measured by cash capital expenditure and operating expenses, rather than capital expenditure alone, is the best way to measure the scale of our financial investment in the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</emphasis></p><p>Read about our position on climate litigation and activism.</p><p>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</emphasis></p><p>Shell's energy transition strategy to accelerate our transformation into a low- and zero-carbon energy business is strongly supported by our shareholders. We have set climate targets that we believe are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Still, a ruling by the District Court of The Hague, in the Netherlands, and some activists, say that Shell's strategy should shift away from oil and gas even faster.</p><p>We agree there is an urgent need to change the world's energy system, and that coordinated changes in energy supply are necessary. But achieving a net-zero emissions energy system requires changes in both energy supply and demand. If, for example, Shell decided to stop selling petrol to accelerate the energy transition, it would not mean that people would buy less petrol. Customers would buy it from other companies and total demand for fossil fuels would not change - it would only shrink Shell's customer base.</p><p>This would prevent us from delivering the energy the world needs today. It would also harm our work with customers to decarbonise different sectors, limit our effectiveness in playing a leading role in the energy transition in the years to come, and affect our financial strength and ability to generate value for shareholders today and in the future.</p><p>Shell is also being asked to reduce emissions further and faster than even the most aggressive energy scenarios and policy pathways for the sectors in which we operate. Shell alone cannot directly influence the energy choices made by our customers. It is for governments to determine the right trade-offs for society and put in place the policies that bring about fundamental changes in the way society consumes energy, for example by mandating the sale of cars that run on low-carbon energy.</p><p>Shell is determined to play its part in helping to change the world's energy system. We are making progress in implementing our energy transition strategy.

They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORWARD LOOKING NON-GAAP MEASURES</emphasis>This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.

The Accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"Carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects.

Investing in net zeroOur Upstream business continues to provide the oil and gas the world needs today, and generates the returns to fund distributions to shareholders and our investments in the energy transition. Our production and sales of oil and gas will decrease in the coming years as we transform our business. At the same time, our investments in the energy system of the future will increase significantly. By 2025, we expect around half of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services including biofuels, hydrogen, power, charging for electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, chemicals and lubricants. In 2022, we expect that around one third of our total expenditure will be on these low- and zero- carbon products and services.

In October 2021, we set a new target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. We have identified six main ways to decarbonise our operations:making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also divesting assets and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining five refineries into low-carbon energy and chemicals parks; using more renewable electricity to power our operations;developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities; and, if required, using nature-based solutions to offset any remaining emissions from our operations. The chart below illustrates our current plans to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 target. PROGRESS IN 2021By the end of 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control to 68 million tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent, an 18% reduction compared with 2016, our base year. This shows significant progress towards achieving our target of a 50% reduction by 2030. In 2021, we improved energy efficiency across our assets. For example, we implemented a project to reduce power requirements for gas compression at our QGC natural gas project in Australia.", "8 million tonnes of hydrocarbons to 1. 0 million tonnes because of non-routine flaring, mainly as a result of operational issues in Nigeria. Shell's Sustainability Report provides more information about flaring. NETCARBONINTENSITYWe are working with our customers to provide the energy they need today, and to accelerate the energy transition. This means changing our portfolio of products as we provide low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. If our customers are not able to use these products, we will help them to store and offset remaining emissions through carbon capture and storage and by providing high-quality, nature-based solutions. By 2050, we will no longer serve customers who have unmitigated carbon emissions. To achieve net zero, we must reduce emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, to zero. We must also cut emissions from the use of energy products sold by Shell (Scope 3), by reducing sales of oil and gas products and growing sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services. We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress, which measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. Crucially, it reflects both a reduction in sales of oil and gas products, and growth in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.", "Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Electricity sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable electricity. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Nature-based solutions offset carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and steel. CARBON INTENSITY PROGRESSWe achieved our short-term target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 2-3% compared with 2016, the base year, with a 2. 5% reduction in 2021. We achieved this reduction by shifting our portfolio to lower-carbon energy products such as natural gas, power and biofuels, which now make up 55% of our total energy sales, compared with 46% in 2016. In 2021, Shell's net carbon intensity was 77 gCO\u2082e/MJ, a 2. 7% increase from the previous year.", "This increase was largely because we made a change in our methodology to better calculate the carbon intensity of our electricity sales. This approach distinguishes between the certified renewable electricity we purchase, electricity from our own generation, or purchased through a power purchase agreement, and electricity purchased from the grid.

We have formed more than 50 collaborations with other leading companies aiming to be at the forefront of the energy transition. Our strategy is to:provide more electricity, while also shifting the power system to renewable energy;develop alternative zero- and low-carbon solutions to traditional fuels, including biofuels, hydrogen, and other zero- and low- carbon gases; andaddress any remaining emissions with decarbonisation solutions such as carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions. BUILDING NEW SUPPLY CHAINSELECTRICITYWe are building a material power business. By 2030, we aim to sell around 560 terawatt hours of electricity per year. This is more than twice the electricity we sell today. We provide electricity and smart energy solutions to residential, commercial and industrial customers through direct electricity sales, and services such as electricity storage. We had 1.", "In September 2021, we announced our ambition to produce around 2 million tonnes of SAF a year by 2025 and to have at least 10% of our global aviation fuel sales as SAF by 2030. We are working with Rolls-Royce to test 100% SAF in airplane engines for the first time. In 2022, Shell was the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore where we have established the supply chain, from blending to distribution, for the Asian market. We support tax incentives to help to drive down the cost of SAF around the world. We are advocating that the EU's 2030 target for the use of SAF doubles from 5% to 10%, and for governments and policymakers to encourage the International Civil Aviation Organization to adopt a net-zero emissions target for 2050. The aviation sector needs verifiable, high-quality nature-based solutions (NBS) to offset emissions, and we are offering these to airline customers such as Etihad Airways. Shell also sees a potential opportunity for hydrogen in aviation and we have taken a stake in ZeroAvia, a developer of hydrogen-electric aircraft. MARINEThe marine sector, like aviation, is hard to decarbonise because of the long life cycle of vessels and high upfront investment costs. Low-carbon solutions include hydrogen and ammonia in the long term, and LNG, biofuels and methanol in the short term. We are developing an initial portfolio of biofuels for shipping, and in 2021, we performed the first bio-LNG bunkering trial in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We have completed more than 400 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations in seven countries and eight ports.", "In 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, Shell's CANSOLV technology was selected for six projects with the potential to capture a combined 12 million tonnes of CO2a year [A].

Of these, 5. 1 million credits were retired in association with the use of our energy products by our customers, with the remainder associated with the production of synthetic lubricants and emissions from Shell's business travel. It is important that nature-based carbon credits are of high quality. In November 2021, Shell published a report 'Ensuring high- quality nature-based carbon credits' that sets out our expectations and approach to quality across our portfolio of nature-based solutions. We expect the market for high-quality credits to grow sharply during the next decade. We expect to retire around 120 million credits in 2030.

[A] Please refer to the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 for the definitions of cash capital expenditure and operating expenses. INVESTING IN NET ZEROWe are significantly increasing our expenditure on low- and zero-carbon energy, helping both Shell and its customers to meet their climate targets. In 2025, we expect around 50% of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services across all our businesses. Most of that 50% is on low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels and hydrogen, power, nature-based solutions, carbon capture and storage and convenience retail, including charging for electric vehicles. The remainder is on our chemicals and lubricants businesses, which do not produce energy products and do not create carbon emissions when used by our customers. When measuring total expenditure, we focus on both cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure so that we can capture the total costs associated with accelerating the transition by working with our customers and in coalitions, key parts of our strategy. Capital expenditure also relates to spending on acquiring and maintaining assets and equipment. It does not reflect the fact that some of our Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses are less capital intensive compared with our Upstream activities, and have higher operating costs. We believe that the only true way to measure our progress in the energy transition is not just to look at changing spending patterns, but also to look at our progress against our net carbon intensity targets."]}, {"relevance_score": 43, "title": "Atos creates faster path to net zero with market-first end-to-end portfolio and Center of Excellence", "published": "2021-06-02", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The unique capabilities provided by Atos through its Global Net Zero Transformation Center of Excellence will be in 9 new hubs across Europe, North America and Asia</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris (France), 2 June 2021 -</emphasis>Atos today confirms its position as the leader of secure and decarbonized digital, by providing customers with<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the most comprehensive, end-to-end decarbonization capabilities on the market to enable and accelerate their journeys to net zero.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new \"A to Zero\" offering is a complete portfolio, supported by two new integrated data platforms.

We are working hard to ensure the safety of our staff and contractors, and to support relief efforts. We have also announced our intention to withdraw from Russian oil and gas.</p><p>As well as being a human tragedy, the war has led to rising energy prices and uncertainty about supplies.</p><p>This extreme disruption in global energy markets has shown that affordable, secure, and reliable energy cannot be taken as a given. It must be protected and managed, through international co-operation: companies, governments and wider society working together. This co-operation includes working with our shareholders and maintaining their support.</p><p>Shell will play a leading role as the world's energy systems change. We will continue to supply the oil and gas that people need today. As one of the world's largest suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), we can ship natural gas to where it is needed most. At the same time, we are accelerating the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy, which is at the heart of our strategy.</p><p>Essentially, an accelerated transition is the best way to ensure security of energy supplies. It is also the best way to help people in some parts of the world who do not yet have access to energy, which is essential for a better quality of life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis>We firmly believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The actions Shell takes over the coming years, and our progress against our short- and medium-term targets, will be crucial steps to ensure that we become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>In the first year of our Powering Progress strategy, we have laid the foundations for success. We have taken critical investment decisions in the production of low-carbon fuels, solar and wind power, and hydrogen. We have made significant changes to our Upstream and refinery portfolios, we reshaped the organisation and we simplified the company and its share structure. We have formed partnerships with some of the world's biggest companies in sectors from aviation to road transport and technology.</p><p>In 2021, we added an ambitious new target to halve absolute emissions from our operations and the energy we buy to run them by 2030 (Scope 1 and 2), compared with 2016 levels and on a net basis. We are well on our way with an 18% reduction by the end of 2021.</p><p>For comparison, we estimate that global energy- and fossil-related CO2emissions actually rose by 2.4% in the period between the end of 2016 and the end of 2021, based on International Energy Agency (IEA) and other data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Change in demand</emphasis>We believe that for the world to decarbonise, a dramatic change in demand for energy is just as critical as changes to supply. That is why an essential part of Shell's strategy is working with our customers across different sectors to reduce emissions.</p><p>We are helping our customers to identify and use low- and zero-carbon alternatives to the energy products they have used for many decades: renewable electricity and hydrogen to power homes, cars, trucks, businesses, and industry; biofuels for cars, trucks and planes; LNG for power, trucks and ships; and carbon capture and storage and nature-based carbon offsets to deal with any remaining emissions.</p><p>This is not only the right approach for the world. It also makes good business sense. We see great business opportunities for Shell in the fast-growing low- and zero-carbon markets where we are well positioned to provide the different products and solutions our customers need.</p><p>We are leading the way in new technologies that will help to decarbonise our operations, and to reduce emissions for our customers. Our scientists are developing new ways to store hydrogen safely, including underground, for example, which will be critical to ensure secure, large-scale supplies of hydrogen to our industrial customers in the future. And our engineers are designing LNG projects which are powered by renewable electricity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Remuneration</emphasis>We included progress in the energy transition in the calculation of the annual bonus for almost all Shell's employees in 2021. Now we are going further. From 2022, we have extended how we measure progress to cover three key themes; reducing emissions from our operations, sales of low- and zero-carbon products and partnering with others to decarbonise road transport.</p><p>In 2019, we were the first major energy company to include an energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan for senior executives. This has vested for the first time at 180%, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stronger and more profitable</emphasis>Last year, 89% of Shell's shareholders voted in favour of our energy transition strategy. We are implementing that strategy, and this year we are asking shareholders to vote on our progress, as we will do every year until 2050. The next energy transition strategy update for an advisory vote is in 2024 and we will give another update on our progress next year.</p><p>Securing shareholder support as we implement our Powering Progress strategy is good governance. The vote on our progress towards our targets and plans is purely advisory and will not be binding on our shareholders. The legal responsibility for Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>When I look at what we have achieved in 2021, and our plans for the years ahead, I believe that Shell will become stronger and more profitable by providing the low- and zero-carbon energy products and services that our customers need. That is good for our shareholders. It is good for our customers. It is also good for the world's climate goals and the planet.</p><p>The continued support of our shareholders is critical for us to become a net-zero emissions energy business and a leader in the energy transition. We believe that Shell's energy transition strategy is in the best interests of our shareholders as a whole and wider society.</p><p>The Board recommends that you vote in favour of Resolution 20 in support of the progress that Shell has made in its energy transition strategy over the past year as described in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S INTRODUCTION</emphasis></p><p>Ben van Beurden, CEO, Shell plc</p><p>In a time of great uncertainty, it is vital that our long-term energy transition strategy remains on track. This report shows the strong progress we have made towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>It will take bold moves for Shell to achieve net zero. In 2021, we took some significant steps. We completed one of the biggest restructurings in our history, making us a more agile company. We decided to simplify our share structure, and moved Shell's headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets</emphasis>In this Energy Transition Progress Report, we show our progress against our climate targets in the year since our shareholders overwhelmingly supported our energy transition strategy.</p><p>We are making significant progress in a long-term plan. Crucially, we set a new target to reduce absolute emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2021, we had achieved a reduction of 18%. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2-3% by the end of 2021, also compared with 2016.</p><p>Now our targets start to get more ambitious. We are working towards a 9-12% reduction in net carbon intensity by 2024, and a 20% reduction by 2030. To put our targets into context, the International Energy Agency Net Zero by 2050 scenario suggests that the transport sector, which accounts for most of Shell's emissions, needs to see a reduction in net carbon intensity of 18% by 2030.</p><p>From today, our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is no longer conditional on society's progress, marking a further step forwards. This reflects the leading role we will play in the energy transition. We must find ways to be ahead of society where we can, while remaining a successful and profitable company.</p><p>As we have seen from the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to take urgent action to meet its climate goals. While countries, companies and individuals are making significant changes, there is still a risk that the world will not achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. This could mean that Shell would find it hard to meet its 2050 target as well. We are rising to that challenge and will demonstrate over time how we will reach our goal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working sector by sector</emphasis>We are investing in low- and zero-carbon products such as renewable electricity, hydrogen, biofuels and chemicals. We are building a leading hydrogen business, and now operate 10% of total electrolyser capacity in the world. We are already one of the world's largest producers of biofuels through our joint venture in Brazil. And last year we started building one of Europe's biggest biofuels facilities.</p><p>Crucially, we are working sector by sector to identify the low- and zero-carbon products and services that our customers need. And we are laying the foundations for future expansion by building capacity and expertise. At the beginning of 2022, for example, with our joint-venture partners, we won bids to develop 5 gigawatts of floating wind power in the UK, enough to power 6 million homes. That is more than double the number of homes in Scotland.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investing in net zero</emphasis>Our Upstream business continues to provide the oil and gas the world needs today, and generates the returns to fund distributions to shareholders and our investments in the energy transition. Our production and sales of oil and gas will decrease in the coming years as we transform our business.</p><p>At the same time, our investments in the energy system of the future will increase significantly. By 2025, we expect around half of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services including biofuels, hydrogen, power, charging for electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, chemicals and lubricants. In 2022, we expect that around one third of our total expenditure will be on these low- and zero- carbon products and services.</p><p>Our planned investments in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK put us among the leading investors in the energy transition there. In the UK, for example, we plan to invest \u00a320-25 billion ($26-33 billion) over the next ten years, mostly in low- and zero-carbon projects including offshore wind, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles, subject to Board approval.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shareholder engagement</emphasis>A central part of our Powering Progress strategy is delivering value for our shareholders. We have made good progress here too. In 2021, we produced a strong financial performance and announced an $8.5 billion share buyback programme in the first half of 2022.</p><p>We will continue our dialogue with shareholders as Shell transforms and evolves. It is important that we are transparent about our progress in the energy transition. From the first quarter of 2022, we intend to publish more information about the profitability of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business, something that investors have asked for.</p><p>We believe that our strategy delivers secure and reliable energy that will accelerate the energy transition and deliver strong profits and returns to shareholders. I ask our shareholders to vote for Resolution 20 in support of our progress towards our targets and milestones as we accelerate towards net zero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON PERFORMANCE AT A GLANCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS SUMMARY</emphasis></p><p>We are transforming into a net-zero emissions energy business. In 2021 and the beginning of 2022 we:</p><p>Reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 18%, and reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2.5%, both by the end of 2021 compared with 2016.Formed more than 50 collaborations with other leading companies aiming to be at the forefront of the energy transition. Continued to build a material power business. We had 1.6 million retail customers worldwide by the end of February 2022, compared with 900,000 at the end of 2020. We have 4.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable generation capacity in operation, under construction and/or committed for sale. We have a further 38 GW of renewable generation capacity in our pipeline of future projects.Expanded our hydrogen business. We have started production from 30 megawatts (MW) of electrolysers that can produce around 4,300 tonnes a year of decarbonised hydrogen. We are looking to take final investment decisions on 10 times this capacity in 2022. We own and operate 10% of global electrolyser capacity today.Took a final investment decision on a facility in the Netherlands to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year. This facility will be one of the largest in Europe to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel made from waste, and is expected to start production in 2024.Continued to build the infrastructure that our customers will need as they move to low- and zero-carbon energy.Expanded our electric vehicle charging network to almost 90,000 charge points at the end of 2021, from around 60,000 in 2020.Increased the number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) refuelling sites in Europe and increased the number of sites for hydrogen refuelling in Europe, North America and China.Announced our ambition for SAF to make up at least 10% of our aviation fuel sales by 2030.Expanded our LNG bunkering operations, including the world's first bio-LNG bunkering, to help to reduce emissions from the marine sector. We also worked with others on programmes to develop hydrogen fuel cell propulsion for ships.Worked with customers across sectors such as commercial, light industry and technology to decarbonise their energy use by providing renewable electricity.Developed partnerships in the heavy industry sector to explore how hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be used to reduce global carbon emissions.Invested in CCS. We have two CCS projects in operation and more than 10 under development.

We are also divesting assets and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining five refineries into low-carbon energy and chemicals parks; using more renewable electricity to power our operations;developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities; and, if required, using nature-based solutions to offset any remaining emissions from our operations.</p><p>The chart below illustrates our current plans to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS IN 2021</emphasis>By the end of 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control to 68 million tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent, an 18% reduction compared with 2016, our base year. This shows significant progress towards achieving our target of a 50% reduction by 2030.</p><p>In 2021, we improved energy efficiency across our assets. For example, we implemented a project to reduce power requirements for gas compression at our QGC natural gas project in Australia. Most of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions came from our Downstream business, in particular from our refining activities. Portfolio changes, such as the sale of the Martinez and Puget Sound refineries in the USA, and the transformation of our Bukom refinery in Singapore into a low-carbon energy and chemicals park, also helped to reduce emissions from our operations. Shell's Annual Report and Accounts provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p>Methane emissions are included in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting. In 2021, we reduced total methane emissions from our operations by 18% to 55,000 tonnes, compared with 67,000 tonnes in 2020. In 2021, our methane emissions intensity averaged 0.06% for assets with gas available for sale, well within our target to maintain less than 0.2% by 2025.</p><p>In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine gas flaring from our Upstream operations to 2025 from 2030. In 2021, routine flaring from our Upstream operations fell to 0.2 million tonnes of hydrocarbons from 0.3 million tonnes of hydrocarbons in the previous year. Despite this, our overall flaring increased from 0.8 million tonnes of hydrocarbons to 1.0 million tonnes because of non-routine flaring, mainly as a result of operational issues in Nigeria. Shell's Sustainability Report provides more information about flaring.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NET</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTENSITY</emphasis></p><p>We are working with our customers to provide the energy they need today, and to accelerate the energy transition. This means changing our portfolio of products as we provide low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>If our customers are not able to use these products, we will help them to store and offset remaining emissions through carbon capture and storage and by providing high-quality, nature-based solutions. By 2050, we will no longer serve customers who have unmitigated carbon emissions.</p><p>To achieve net zero, we must reduce emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, to zero. We must also cut emissions from the use of energy products sold by Shell (Scope 3), by reducing sales of oil and gas products and growing sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.</p><p>We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress, which measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. Crucially, it reflects both a reduction in sales of oil and gas products, and growth in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.</p><p>Reducing net carbon intensity encourages us to work with our customers in sectors such as aviation and shipping to decarbonise their use of energy, while still providing the oil and gas they need today. And, as an intensity metric, it measures the true transformation that is happening in the company as we implement our energy transition strategy.</p><p>Other metrics, such as a simple total carbon emissions metric, would reflect how our sales of oil and gas products are shrinking, but would not provide information on how we are changing our mix of products.</p><p>We believe that our total absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes, and our total absolute emissions were 1.4 gigatonnes in 2021. We are working to reduce them to net zero by 2050. This is the same as a 100% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALIGNED WITH PARIS</emphasis>We believe our targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00c5\u00e3C above pre-industrial levels. There is no standard methodology to determine how to align companies' plans and targets with the goal of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>We studied a subset of IPCC scenarios that achieve that goal and were focused on earlier action and placed less reliance on the use of carbon sinks. From this subset, we calculated the range of carbon intensity pathways over time. We set our targets to fall within these pathways.</p><p>Our calculations show that the net carbon intensity of the energy mix will need to fall by around 15-35% by 2030. Shell has set a target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 20% by 2030.</p><p>[A] We measure net carbon intensity using our Net Carbon Footprint methodology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDUCING CARBON INTENSITY</emphasis>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing our sales of low-carbon products and services. The chart below illustrates how this change in our product mix could help us to achieve our target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 20% by 2030.</p><p>Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products.</p><p>Electricity sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable electricity. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products.</p><p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Nature-based solutions offset carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and steel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON INTENSITY PROGRESS</emphasis>We achieved our short-term target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 2-3% compared with 2016, the base year, with a 2.5% reduction in 2021. We achieved this reduction by shifting our portfolio to lower-carbon energy products such as natural gas, power and biofuels, which now make up 55% of our total energy sales, compared with 46% in 2016.</p><p>In 2021, Shell's net carbon intensity was 77 gCO\u2082e/MJ, a 2.7% increase from the previous year. This increase was largely because we made a change in our methodology to better calculate the carbon intensity of our electricity sales. This approach distinguishes between the certified renewable electricity we purchase, electricity from our own generation, or purchased through a power purchase agreement, and electricity purchased from the grid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SECTORAL DECARBONISATION</emphasis></p><p>Read how Shell is working with customers, sector by sector, to help to transform the energy system.</p><p>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUILDING NEW SUPPLY CHAINS19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CHANGING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM</emphasis></p><p>To help to transform the energy system, Shell is working with customers, sector by sector. We have formed more than 50 collaborations with other leading companies aiming to be at the forefront of the energy transition.</p><p>Our strategy is to:</p><p>provide more electricity, while also shifting the power system to renewable energy;develop alternative zero- and low-carbon solutions to traditional fuels, including biofuels, hydrogen, and other zero- and low- carbon gases; andaddress any remaining emissions with decarbonisation solutions such as carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUILDING NEW SUPPLY CHAINS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELECTRICITY</emphasis>We are building a material power business. By 2030, we aim to sell around 560 terawatt hours of electricity per year. This is more than twice the electricity we sell today.</p><p>We provide electricity and smart energy solutions to residential, commercial and industrial customers through direct electricity sales, and services such as electricity storage. We had 1.6 million retail customers worldwide by the end of February 2022, compared with 900,000 at the end of 2020. This increase is largely because we added more than 500,000 retail customers in the UK in 2021, and around 185,000 retail customers In Australia following our acquisition of PowerShop in 2022. Our largest markets for commercial and industrial customers are in Australia and the USA.</p><p>In addition to the investments we have made in building our customer base, we are also investing in building our generation capacity. We have 4.7 GW of renewable generation capacity in operation, under construction and/or committed for sale. We have a further 38 GW of renewable generation capacity in our pipeline of future projects.</p><p>We have added to our renewable generation capabilities by acquiring Savion, a US-based solar and energy storage specialist; Solar-Konzept Italia, an Italian solar specialist; and WestWind, a wind specialist based in Australia.</p><p>Shell is one of the leading developers of floating wind farms in the world with prototypes, pilot farms and commercial-scale projects in development in France, Ireland, Norway, Scotland and South Korea.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYDROGEN</emphasis>We are expanding our hydrogen projects to serve sectors such as road freight, steel and cement. These projects include the production, storage and shipping of hydrogen.</p><p>As we grow, we are using Shell's integrated businesses to connect the different parts of the hydrogen system, from offshore wind to power the electrolysers that produce hydrogen, to using hydrogen in our energy and chemicals parks and eventually, supplying it through our retail network.</p><p>We are increasing our capacity, investing in infrastructure and helping to increase the scale and the adoption of hydrogen across different sectors. We have increased our total electrolyser capacity from 2 MW to 30 MW, 10% of the global capacity of installed electrolysers in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p><p>We have added a 20 MW electrolyser in China, which at the time was the largest in the world, and a 10 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser in Germany, the biggest of its kind in Europe. The electrolysers can produce 3,000 tonnes and 1,300 tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen a year respectively.</p><p>In 2022, with our partners, we plan to take final investment decisions on electrolysers with a total capacity of 300 MW. In the Netherlands, we plan to build a 200 MW electrolyser, which is expected to start operations by 2024 and to produce around 20,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year. In Germany, we plan to take a final investment decision on a 100 MW electrolyser in 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIOFUELS</emphasis>The transport sector accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the IEA. Biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biodiesel, bioethanol and renewable natural gas are low-carbon fuels which can be used by customers to reduce their emissions without having to change their airplanes, cars, trucks, or ships.</p><p>In 2021, around 9.1 billion litres of biofuels were blended into Shell's fuels worldwide, around 5.8% of global biofuels consumption, according to figures from the IEA.</p><p>Shell and our Brazilian joint venture Ra\u00edzen, in which Shell has a 44% share, are together among the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels for the mobility sector. Ra\u00edzen produced 2.5 billion litres of first-generation ethanol in 2021, which is around 2.5% of global ethanol production, according to the IEA. It also acquired Biosev, adding a further 50% to its production capacity. And it took a final investment decision on its second-generation cellulosic ethanol facility, which will have a capacity of 80 million litres and is expected to start operations in 2023.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell took a final investment decision on a facility to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year. This facility will be one of the largest in Europe to produce SAF and renewable diesel made from waste, and is expected to start production in 2024. We are considering further investments to produce SAF at our energy and chemicals parks in Germany and Singapore.</p><p>As well as liquid biofuels, we are developing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG). Our newly operational Junction City RNG plant in Oregon is the largest plant in the USA to produce natural gas from agricultural residues, with an annual capacity of 736,000 million British thermal units.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONVENTIONAL</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FUELS</emphasis>The world will need less oil and gas as it moves to a low- and zero-carbon energy system. This transition is reflected in Shell's changing portfolio. In 2021, our oil production was 3.9% lower than in the previous year, as a result of divestments and natural decline. It was 7.6% lower than in 2019, when our oil production peaked. We expect our oil production to decline by an average of 1-2% a year to 2030.</p><p>We plan to reduce annual spending on exploration to around $1.5 billion between 2021 and 2025. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025.</p><p>We are transforming our refineries into five energy and chemicals parks which will produce low-carbon and synthetic fuels, as well as bitumen, lubricants and chemicals. The transformation of our refineries will help us to reduce production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030, from around 91 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 2020 to 45 mtpa by 2030. In 2021, we reduced our production of traditional fuels to 71 mtpa.</p><p>Liquified natural gas (LNG) plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a lower- carbon alternative. We are adding around 7 mtpa of new LNG capacity, which is under construction and expected to be on stream around the middle of the decade. This includes our LNG Canada joint venture and our interest in a new LNG processing unit in Nigeria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANGING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS</emphasis></p><p>A critical part of our success in the energy transition will be our ability to work sector by sector with customers and stakeholders. By listening to our customers, learning from them and working with them, we can understand what they value and need as the world moves towards a lower-carbon future. We aim to use such insights to profitably provide the low-carbon products and services they will want to buy.</p><p>We are also working with those operating in each sector, and with policymakers, to increase ambition around reducing emissions, better enable changes to infrastructure, and provide favourable conditions for investing in lower-carbon options. We are joining coalitions focused on decarbonising sectors and working with others to produce reports that identify and show pathways to reduce emissions in some of the sectors that are hardest to abate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERSONAL MOBILITY</emphasis>Shell is the world's largest mobility retailer, with more than 46,000 service stations operating in more than 80 markets. We believe the biggest opportunity to decarbonise our portfolio is by offering more low-carbon alternatives such as biofuels, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles.</p><p>In 2021, Shell operated almost 90,000 electric vehicle charge points, up from around 60,000 in the previous year. We aim to increase this to more than 500,000 by 2025, and to 2.5 million by 2030. That is around 7% of the expected number of charge points in the world by 2030, according to the IEA. In January 2021, we acquired ubitricity, a European provider of on-street charging for electric vehicles through lamp posts.</p><p>We are also expanding our network of hydrogen refuelling stations. By the end of 2021, there were around 50 hydrogen refuelling stations at Shell-branded outlets in Europe and North America where drivers can fill up their vehicles with hydrogen fuel.</p><p>In Germany, we are a member of the H2 Mobility joint venture to develop a nationwide network of hydrogen refuelling stations for passenger cars. The venture operates more than 90 stations across Germany.</p><p>We offer carbon credits to passenger car drivers who want to offset the life-cycle emissions of the fuel they buy from Shell. We have made this offer available to passenger car drivers at more than 3,100 retail sites in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. In 2021, around 49 million litres of fuel sales were offset, accounting for 1% of our total volumes sold in markets where we have an offset programme.</p><p>Shell supports the European Commission's proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport by 13% by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROAD FREIGHT</emphasis>The road freight sector will be able to use battery electric power and hydrogen to get to net zero, as well as biogas, biofuels and liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in trucks and buses. In 2021, we added 18 LNG refuelling stations to our network, which now consists of 44 sites across Europe.</p><p>In 2022, we started construction of our bio-LNG liquefaction plant in Rheinland, Germany, which will provide bio-LNG to 4,000-5,000 LNG trucks by 2023. We also started offering bio-LNG blended with regular LNG to all our customers in the Netherlands.</p><p>We are working with partners to increase the adoption of hydrogen and electric trucks. We signed an agreement with Daimler Truck AG, for example, to encourage the adoption of hydrogen trucks in Europe. Shell aims to build 150 hydrogen refuelling stations and supply around 5,000 Mercedes-Benz heavy-duty trucks with hydrogen by 2030.</p><p>In the USA, through our subsidiary Shell Recharge Solutions, we started providing electric charging infrastructure for trucks as part of a project led by Volvo Group and South Coast Air Quality Management District.</p><p>We offer nature-based carbon credits to fleet customers in 17 countries. This enables them to offset the emissions generated by the extraction, refining, distribution and use of the Shell fuel they buy.</p><p>We support policies and incentives in the European Union (EU) that would enable all new medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2040, to help the EU to meet its 2050 carbon neutrality goal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AVIATION</emphasis>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the aviation sector's most viable option for reducing its emissions in the short to medium term.</p><p>SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of the world's consumption of aviation fuel. Currently, Shell supplies SAF made by others. From 2024, we will start supplying customers with SAF produced at our Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In September 2021, we announced our ambition to produce around 2 million tonnes of SAF a year by 2025 and to have at least 10% of our global aviation fuel sales as SAF by 2030.</p><p>We are working with Rolls-Royce to test 100% SAF in airplane engines for the first time. In 2022, Shell was the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore where we have established the supply chain, from blending to distribution, for the Asian market.</p><p>We support tax incentives to help to drive down the cost of SAF around the world. We are advocating that the EU's 2030 target for the use of SAF doubles from 5% to 10%, and for governments and policymakers to encourage the International Civil Aviation Organization to adopt a net-zero emissions target for 2050.</p><p>The aviation sector needs verifiable, high-quality nature-based solutions (NBS) to offset emissions, and we are offering these to airline customers such as Etihad Airways. Shell also sees a potential opportunity for hydrogen in aviation and we have taken a stake in ZeroAvia, a developer of hydrogen-electric aircraft.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINE</emphasis>The marine sector, like aviation, is hard to decarbonise because of the long life cycle of vessels and high upfront investment costs. Low-carbon solutions include hydrogen and ammonia in the long term, and LNG, biofuels and methanol in the short term. We are developing an initial portfolio of biofuels for shipping, and in 2021, we performed the first bio-LNG bunkering trial in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p><p>We have completed more than 400 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations in seven countries and eight ports. In 2021, we carried out the first LNG bunkering operations in Gibraltar and Singapore. We are aiming to double the size of our LNG bunkering network by the mid-2020s, to around 15 major ports on key international trading routes. Shell is a member of a coalition that is calling for at least 5% zero-emissions fuel in international shipping by 2030, and for commercially viable zero- emissions vessels on deep-sea trade routes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIGHT INDUSTRY AND COMMERCIAL</emphasis>We serve customers across the industrial and commercial sectors where there is growing demand for decarbonisation products and services. More than 2,000 companies and organisations have made commitments to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. We are now forming strategic alliances with big multinational companies such as Microsoft and Amazon, helping them and us to achieve our net-zero aims.</p><p>For example, we are supplying Microsoft with renewable energy as part of our strategic alliance launched in 2020. In 2021, we advanced this partnership by signing several agreements to supply more than 500 MW of renewable energy, helping Microsoft to meet its goal of using 100% renewable energy by 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEAVY INDUSTRY</emphasis>The heavy industrial sector includes utilities, process industries, such as chemicals, refining and industrial gases, and heavy manufacturing industries such as steel, cement, glass, and paper and pulp.</p><p>It is challenging to decarbonise these sectors rapidly because they involve complex processes and the required technologies are not available at scale. They also tend to involve processes that require high temperatures, dense energy storage and, in many cases, chemical reactions that produce CO2as part of the production process.</p><p>In 2021, we entered into several agreements with leading businesses to reduce emissions from heavy industry. We are exploring how hydrogen can help to reduce emissions from the steel sector, for example, in partnership with steel producers Baosteel in</p><p>China and Bluescope in Australia. Together with companies such as Pan-United Corporation in Singapore, we are developing opportunities to produce low-carbon concrete products.</p><p>In industrial hubs where we have low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, including in the Netherlands and Singapore, we are working with other companies to build the infrastructure required to support the decarbonisation of several facilities at one time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE</emphasis>Shell's ambition is to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce emissions where there are no currently scalable low-carbon alternatives. We seek to have access to an additional 25 million tonnes a year of CCS capacity by 2035 - equal to 25 CCS facilities the size of our Quest site in Canada.</p><p>In 2021, Shell's operating costs for and investment in CCS opportunities amounted to around $146 million. Shell's share of captured and stored CO2was 0.4 million tonnes in 2021. By the end of 2021, our Quest CCS operations in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 6.5 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron), which started operating in August 2019, had stored more than 5 million tonnes of CO2by the end of 2021. Gorgon is the largest CCS operation in the world.</p><p>We have taken a final investment decision on the Northern Lights project in Norway which includes the transport and permanent storage of CO2in a reservoir beneath the sea. The first phase of this project will provide more than 0.25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CCS capacity by 2025. In total, we have two CCS projects in operation and more than 10 under development.</p><p>Shell's CANSOLV CO2system is one of the leading large-scale, post-combustion, carbon capture technologies in commercial operation. After capture, the CO2is released as a pure stream that can be stored or used in other processes. In 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, Shell's CANSOLV technology was selected for six projects with the potential to capture a combined 12 million tonnes of CO2a year [A]. These projects are in the UK and the USA and span the refining, chemicals and power sectors.</p><p>Read more about our CCS projects at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ccs\">www.shell.com/ccs</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS</emphasis>Carbon credits generated by high-quality nature-based projects may be used by Shell and our customers to offset emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and offset.</p><p>Shell is investing in the development of high-quality nature-based projects, which are independently audited for the quality and quantity of credits. In 2021, we invested $26 million in nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and the prevention of landscape degradation and destruction. We also invested $11 million in cookstove projects, which reduce the emissions from households traditionally using open fires for cooking.</p><p>In 2021, we expanded our offer of carbon credits to drivers and business customers who wish to compensate for the life-cycle CO2-equivalent emissions generated by their use of the Shell fuel they buy. We have made this offer available to our fleet customers in 17 countries and to retail customers at more than 3,100 service stations in Austria, Canada, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK.</p><p>We retired around 6 million credits in 2021, which we estimate is the equivalent to 2.9 million cars being taken off the road for one year. Of these, 5.1 million credits were retired in association with the use of our energy products by our customers, with the remainder associated with the production of synthetic lubricants and emissions from Shell's business travel.</p><p>It is important that nature-based carbon credits are of high quality. In November 2021, Shell published a report 'Ensuring high- quality nature-based carbon credits' that sets out our expectations and approach to quality across our portfolio of nature-based solutions.</p><p>We expect the market for high-quality credits to grow sharply during the next decade. We expect to retire around 120 million credits in 2030.</p><p>[A] This is shared as an example of how Shell is developing and using technology to capture CO2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK</emphasis></p><p>Read about our planned total expenditure and expected returns across our businesses.</p><p>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INVESTING IN NET ZERO</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS</emphasis></p><p>Shell's financial strength and access to capital give us the ability to provide significant shareholder returns and to profitably transform our portfolio to meet our target of achieving net-zero emissions. They also allow us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets and to continue to provide the energy the world needs.</p><p>We are stepping up our investments in low- and zero-carbon energy where we see good opportunities for growth and strong returns. From the first quarter of 2022, we will report separately on the performance of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business, which includes our integrated power, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and nature-based solutions businesses. We will also report separately on the performance of our Marketing business, which includes charging for electric vehicles and biofuels. We expect to provide more details on the performance of these activities as they grow.</p><p>We set out our planned total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) [A], and expected returns, across our businesses. Our strategy is to:</p><p>Increase our investments in Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions, with expected returns of 15-25% and more than 10% respectively.[B]These businesses include our service stations, sales of gasoline and diesel, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. They focus on working with our customers to accelerate the transition to net zero and are the foundations for the future businesses in Shell.Maintain our investments in our Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products businesses, with expected returns of 14-18% and 10-15% respectively. [C]These businesses make and sell the products needed to enable the energy transition. They produce sustainable cash flows and give us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our low-carbon businesses. Limit our investments in our Upstream oil and gas business, with expected returns of 20-25%.

Most of that 50% is on low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels and hydrogen, power, nature-based solutions, carbon capture and storage and convenience retail, including charging for electric vehicles. The remainder is on our chemicals and lubricants businesses, which do not produce energy products and do not create carbon emissions when used by our customers.</p><p>When measuring total expenditure, we focus on both cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure so that we can capture the total costs associated with accelerating the transition by working with our customers and in coalitions, key parts of our strategy.</p><p>Capital expenditure also relates to spending on acquiring and maintaining assets and equipment. It does not reflect the fact that some of our Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses are less capital intensive compared with our Upstream activities, and have higher operating costs.</p><p>We believe that the only true way to measure our progress in the energy transition is not just to look at changing spending patterns, but also to look at our progress against our net carbon intensity targets. In the short term, by the end of 2024, we are aiming for a reduction in our net carbon intensity of 9-12% compared with 2016, which is a significant step up on our 2-3% target for 2021. We have achieved this target with a 2.5% reduction compared with our 2016 base year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POLICIES AND GOVERNANCE</emphasis></p><p>Read about our climate-related governance and policy engagement, and our disclosures linked to climate standards and benchmarks.</p><p>27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE GOVERNANCE28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A JUST TRANSITION29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT</emphasis></p><p>We aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around climate-related policy engagement. We set out our approach, policy positions, examples of our advocacy, and reviews of our memberships of industry associations on our website (see <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>).</p><p>In October 2021, we published our updated global climate and energy transition policy positions to reflect our Powering Progress strategy and our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. We believe that by advocating these positions as we transform our business, we support the energy transition and the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p>Our detailed policy positions serve as a global framework for Shell's advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, coalitions, and other stakeholders globally, regionally and within countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS</emphasis>We have continued to work to ensure our memberships of industry associations support our climate-related policy positions. We have seen positive signs such as wider support for the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing and the regulation of methane emissions. We are clear that our memberships should strengthen and not undermine our support of the goal of the Paris Agreement and the global drive to achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>We published our latest Industry Associations Climate Review in 2021, and a progress update in April 2022. This provides an update on industry associations where we found some misalignment and material misalignment, details of our climate lobbying in the European Union and the USA, and information on our payments to 36 associations. We will publish our next Industry Associations Climate Review in 2023 and plan to use our updated climate and energy transition policy positions as the basis of our assessments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE GOVERNANCE</emphasis></p><p>Our climate governance begins with the Board's approval of our energy transition strategy and oversight of its implementation and delivery. In 2021, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year when reviewing and guiding our energy transition strategy, assessing the risk management policies in place, and challenging and endorsing the business plans and budgets, including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. In 2021, the Board convened on 12 occasions and continued to regularly oversee the Powering Progress strategy and net-zero initiatives, including at the Board Strategy Day in June 2021.</p><p>An important part of Shell's governance is to help manage our transition to a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We have further aligned remuneration with progress in the energy transition, by making changes to the annual bonus scorecard, which helps determine bonus outcomes for most Shell employees including Executive Committee members.</p><p>The progress in the energy transition measure, which makes up 15% of the annual bonus scorecard, had previously focused entirely on managing and reducing Shell's operational emissions. We decided to widen this to take account of our success at selling lower-carbon products and working with our customers to advance decarbonisation.</p><p>As a result, from 2022, the energy transition measure will be split into three components, each accounting for 5% of the scorecard:</p><p>selling low- and zero-carbon products;reducing Shell's operational emissions (our Scope 1 and 2 emissions); andpartnering to decarbonise (to be measured in terms of our progress in rolling out our electric vehicle charging network).</p><p>We also decided to introduce a customer excellence component in the operational excellence measure on the annual bonus scorecard. This is because our Powering Progress strategy places great emphasis on building strong customer relationships to help transform Shell in the energy transition.</p><p>In 2019, we were the first major energy company to include an energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan for senior executives. This has vested for the first time at 180%, based on performance between 2019 and the end of 2021, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future.</p><p>For further details of Shell's governance structure, see the Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A JUST TRANSITION</emphasis></p><p>Shell's Powering Progress strategy has four main goals in support of our purpose. These goals include Powering Lives, which Shell does through its products and activities, and by supporting an inclusive society.</p><p>Shell supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, which recognises the importance of a just transition. A just transition means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.</p><p>We aim to publish our just transition guiding principles in the next year. We have joined two collaborations to help to inform our approach. In 2021, we became a member of IPIECA's Just Transition Task Force, which aims to help companies to develop their approaches to a just transition and share good practice. In January 2022, we joined Energy for a Just Transition, a coalition created by the non-governmental organisations Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and The B Team.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting staff</emphasis>In 2021, around 1,700 Shell employees completed about 2,300 courses related to new skills needed for the energy transition. These included courses on hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fair pay</emphasis>In 2022, Shell published its Fair Pay principles to increase transparency of our pay policies for staff. We also expect our suppliers to provide their employees with wages and benefits that meet or exceed the national legal standards.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES</emphasis>Shell welcomes the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends that companies disclose information in four areas: governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets.

The table below shows how Shell was assessed in the March 2022 Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark.</p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climateaction100.org/whos-involved/companies/\">https://www.climateaction100.org/whos-involved/companies/</url> n/a = not applicable</p><p>The Climate Action 100+ benchmark uses assessments by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI). In its assessment, TPI highlights that it has recalculated Shell's net carbon intensity according to its own methodology. It also highlights that Shell has set further targets to reduce its net carbon intensity, but they were not included in this assessment as it was not possible to make them consistent with TPI's methodology.</p><p>We were disappointed with this outcome as we had engaged with CA100+ and TPI to understand the differences in the methodologies used. We had clarified our 2035 and 2050 targets on that basis. However, we will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets are reflected in the next Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark. We believe that this could result in a change to the Shell assessment to 'meets all criteria' for at least five indicators, 'partial, meets some criteria' for three indicators and one 'does not meet any criteria' rating for capital allocation.</p><p>As described in this report, we continue to believe that total expenditure, as measured by cash capital expenditure and operating expenses, rather than capital expenditure alone, is the best way to measure the scale of our financial investment in the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</emphasis></p><p>Read about our position on climate litigation and activism.</p><p>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</emphasis></p><p>Shell's energy transition strategy to accelerate our transformation into a low- and zero-carbon energy business is strongly supported by our shareholders. We have set climate targets that we believe are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Still, a ruling by the District Court of The Hague, in the Netherlands, and some activists, say that Shell's strategy should shift away from oil and gas even faster.</p><p>We agree there is an urgent need to change the world's energy system, and that coordinated changes in energy supply are necessary. But achieving a net-zero emissions energy system requires changes in both energy supply and demand. If, for example, Shell decided to stop selling petrol to accelerate the energy transition, it would not mean that people would buy less petrol. Customers would buy it from other companies and total demand for fossil fuels would not change - it would only shrink Shell's customer base.</p><p>This would prevent us from delivering the energy the world needs today. It would also harm our work with customers to decarbonise different sectors, limit our effectiveness in playing a leading role in the energy transition in the years to come, and affect our financial strength and ability to generate value for shareholders today and in the future.</p><p>Shell is also being asked to reduce emissions further and faster than even the most aggressive energy scenarios and policy pathways for the sectors in which we operate. Shell alone cannot directly influence the energy choices made by our customers. It is for governments to determine the right trade-offs for society and put in place the policies that bring about fundamental changes in the way society consumes energy, for example by mandating the sale of cars that run on low-carbon energy.</p><p>Shell is determined to play its part in helping to change the world's energy system. We are making progress in implementing our energy transition strategy.

They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement.

We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.

Investing in net zeroOur Upstream business continues to provide the oil and gas the world needs today, and generates the returns to fund distributions to shareholders and our investments in the energy transition. Our production and sales of oil and gas will decrease in the coming years as we transform our business. At the same time, our investments in the energy system of the future will increase significantly. By 2025, we expect around half of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services including biofuels, hydrogen, power, charging for electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, chemicals and lubricants.

In October 2021, we set a new target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. We have identified six main ways to decarbonise our operations:making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also divesting assets and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining five refineries into low-carbon energy and chemicals parks; using more renewable electricity to power our operations;developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities; and, if required, using nature-based solutions to offset any remaining emissions from our operations. The chart below illustrates our current plans to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 target. PROGRESS IN 2021By the end of 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control to 68 million tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent, an 18% reduction compared with 2016, our base year. This shows significant progress towards achieving our target of a 50% reduction by 2030. In 2021, we improved energy efficiency across our assets. For example, we implemented a project to reduce power requirements for gas compression at our QGC natural gas project in Australia.", "8 million tonnes of hydrocarbons to 1. 0 million tonnes because of non-routine flaring, mainly as a result of operational issues in Nigeria. Shell's Sustainability Report provides more information about flaring. NETCARBONINTENSITYWe are working with our customers to provide the energy they need today, and to accelerate the energy transition. This means changing our portfolio of products as we provide low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. If our customers are not able to use these products, we will help them to store and offset remaining emissions through carbon capture and storage and by providing high-quality, nature-based solutions. By 2050, we will no longer serve customers who have unmitigated carbon emissions. To achieve net zero, we must reduce emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, to zero. We must also cut emissions from the use of energy products sold by Shell (Scope 3), by reducing sales of oil and gas products and growing sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services. We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress, which measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. Crucially, it reflects both a reduction in sales of oil and gas products, and growth in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.", "Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Electricity sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable electricity. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Nature-based solutions offset carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and steel. CARBON INTENSITY PROGRESSWe achieved our short-term target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 2-3% compared with 2016, the base year, with a 2. 5% reduction in 2021. We achieved this reduction by shifting our portfolio to lower-carbon energy products such as natural gas, power and biofuels, which now make up 55% of our total energy sales, compared with 46% in 2016. In 2021, Shell's net carbon intensity was 77 gCO\u2082e/MJ, a 2. 7% increase from the previous year.", "This increase was largely because we made a change in our methodology to better calculate the carbon intensity of our electricity sales. This approach distinguishes between the certified renewable electricity we purchase, electricity from our own generation, or purchased through a power purchase agreement, and electricity purchased from the grid.

We have formed more than 50 collaborations with other leading companies aiming to be at the forefront of the energy transition. Our strategy is to:provide more electricity, while also shifting the power system to renewable energy;develop alternative zero- and low-carbon solutions to traditional fuels, including biofuels, hydrogen, and other zero- and low- carbon gases; andaddress any remaining emissions with decarbonisation solutions such as carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions. BUILDING NEW SUPPLY CHAINSELECTRICITYWe are building a material power business. By 2030, we aim to sell around 560 terawatt hours of electricity per year. This is more than twice the electricity we sell today. We provide electricity and smart energy solutions to residential, commercial and industrial customers through direct electricity sales, and services such as electricity storage. We had 1.", "In September 2021, we announced our ambition to produce around 2 million tonnes of SAF a year by 2025 and to have at least 10% of our global aviation fuel sales as SAF by 2030. We are working with Rolls-Royce to test 100% SAF in airplane engines for the first time. In 2022, Shell was the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore where we have established the supply chain, from blending to distribution, for the Asian market. We support tax incentives to help to drive down the cost of SAF around the world. We are advocating that the EU's 2030 target for the use of SAF doubles from 5% to 10%, and for governments and policymakers to encourage the International Civil Aviation Organization to adopt a net-zero emissions target for 2050. The aviation sector needs verifiable, high-quality nature-based solutions (NBS) to offset emissions, and we are offering these to airline customers such as Etihad Airways. Shell also sees a potential opportunity for hydrogen in aviation and we have taken a stake in ZeroAvia, a developer of hydrogen-electric aircraft. MARINEThe marine sector, like aviation, is hard to decarbonise because of the long life cycle of vessels and high upfront investment costs. Low-carbon solutions include hydrogen and ammonia in the long term, and LNG, biofuels and methanol in the short term. We are developing an initial portfolio of biofuels for shipping, and in 2021, we performed the first bio-LNG bunkering trial in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We have completed more than 400 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations in seven countries and eight ports.", "In 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, Shell's CANSOLV technology was selected for six projects with the potential to capture a combined 12 million tonnes of CO2a year [A]. These projects are in the UK and the USA and span the refining, chemicals and power sectors. Read more about our CCS projects at www. shell. com/ccs. NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONSCarbon credits generated by high-quality nature-based projects may be used by Shell and our customers to offset emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and offset. Shell is investing in the development of high-quality nature-based projects, which are independently audited for the quality and quantity of credits. In 2021, we invested $26 million in nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and the prevention of landscape degradation and destruction. We also invested $11 million in cookstove projects, which reduce the emissions from households traditionally using open fires for cooking. In 2021, we expanded our offer of carbon credits to drivers and business customers who wish to compensate for the life-cycle CO2-equivalent emissions generated by their use of the Shell fuel they buy. We have made this offer available to our fleet customers in 17 countries and to retail customers at more than 3,100 service stations in Austria, Canada, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK.", "Read more about our CCS projects at www. shell. com/ccs.

Of these, 5. 1 million credits were retired in association with the use of our energy products by our customers, with the remainder associated with the production of synthetic lubricants and emissions from Shell's business travel. It is important that nature-based carbon credits are of high quality. In November 2021, Shell published a report 'Ensuring high- quality nature-based carbon credits' that sets out our expectations and approach to quality across our portfolio of nature-based solutions. We expect the market for high-quality credits to grow sharply during the next decade. We expect to retire around 120 million credits in 2030.

INVESTING IN NET ZEROWe are significantly increasing our expenditure on low- and zero-carbon energy, helping both Shell and its customers to meet their climate targets. In 2025, we expect around 50% of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services across all our businesses. Most of that 50% is on low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels and hydrogen, power, nature-based solutions, carbon capture and storage and convenience retail, including charging for electric vehicles. The remainder is on our chemicals and lubricants businesses, which do not produce energy products and do not create carbon emissions when used by our customers. When measuring total expenditure, we focus on both cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure so that we can capture the total costs associated with accelerating the transition by working with our customers and in coalitions, key parts of our strategy. Capital expenditure also relates to spending on acquiring and maintaining assets and equipment. It does not reflect the fact that some of our Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses are less capital intensive compared with our Upstream activities, and have higher operating costs. We believe that the only true way to measure our progress in the energy transition is not just to look at changing spending patterns, but also to look at our progress against our net carbon intensity targets."]}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "Europe aims to scale up infrastructure for permanent carbon removals", "published": "2022-02-22", "bodyText": "<p>The European Commission is looking at ways of building up infrastructure for transporting and permanently storing CO2 underground as well as recycling carbon into new products.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "EU unveils data-driven climate adaptation strategy, drawing green criticism", "published": "2021-02-25", "bodyText": "<p>More and better data is needed to improve knowledge of how to adapt to climate change, according to the European Commission's new adaptation strategy, which immediately came under fire from green activists for missing binding targets.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 588, "title": "Shell plc publishes its Energy Transition Progress Report 2022", "published": "2023-03-16", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell reports good progress on journey to net-zero emissions</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shell plc has published its Energy Transition Progress Report 2022, which can be viewed and downloaded from\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eIpdyeULemMbop35eNF3L_aWF170jeFqXlVV7dZFKS5Pvrf2tJfmqTPHEdutooZh4zFQCrMUv02NjkwKEFMwhLkOY3FIe-hsAlSikJmg6-E=\">www.shell.com/agm</url>.

The conflict has also highlighted the need for a global supply of secure and affordable energy. Amid this period of heightened uncertainty, we have worked hard to keep energy flowing to households and businesses around the world.</p><p>In 2022, I witnessed first-hand how our staff diverted energy supplies to where they were most needed. In total, we delivered 194 cargoes of liquefied natural gas to Europe - almost five times our usual average. This work helped to avert the threat of blackouts and to build up energy supplies ahead of next winter.</p><p>Against this backdrop, we made good progress in putting our energy transition strategy into action. As we delivered the oil and gas the world needs today, we reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 30% by the end of 2022, compared with 2016 on a net basis. This is more than halfway towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030. Global energy-related carbon emissions increased by around 4% over the same period. [A]</p><p>We continued to work towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 by making significant investments in solar and wind power, biofuels and hydrogen. For example, we made our biggest acquisition in the energy transition yet with the purchase of Denmark's Nature Energy for around $2 billion. This acquisition makes us Europe's largest producer of renewable natural gas, which is made from agricultural, industrial and household waste.</p><p>Renewable natural gas can be used by customers in sectors such as commercial road transport and shipping. This is part of the work we are undertaking, sector by sector, to identify the low- and zero-carbon products that our customers need to reduce their emissions.</p><p>We continued to build infrastructure to help our customers switch to low- and zero-carbon energy. In 2022, for example, we increased the number of electric vehicle chargers we owned or operated by 62% to around 139,000, compared with the previous year.</p><p>The development of new technologies is vital to decarbonising our own operations, as well as reducing the emissions for our customers. In 2022, we launched the Energy Transition Campus Amsterdam in the Netherlands, which creates an opportunity for Shell and other companies to research new technologies for the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Engaging with shareholders</emphasis></p><p>The continued support of our shareholders is critical to Shell's success as a company. In 2021, shareholders supported our energy transition strategy with 89% of the votes. In contrast, a resolution by shareholder group Follow This calling for a different energy transition strategy received 30% of the votes. Shareholders will get the opportunity to vote again on our strategy in 2024.</p><p>In 2022, 80% of our shareholders voted in support of the progress we had made in 2021 in implementing our energy transition strategy. Along with other Board members, I met many of our largest investors following that vote, including during investor engagements in September. I am grateful for their time and feedback, and look forward to our next engagements in April 2023.</p><p>The publication of annual progress reports, along with the advisory votes, have resulted in a more informed dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard, for example, that some large investors did not follow the Board's recommendation to vote in support of Shell's progress in 2022, because they mainly focused on Shell's energy transition strategy overall, and not on our progress. Some shareholders also indicated that societal pressure, potential media coverage, and expectations from investors in their funds were reasons for not following the Board's recommendation.</p><p>Other investors told us they would like Shell to introduce medium-term targets to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions produced by customers when they use our products. The Board has considered setting a Scope 3 absolute emissions target but has found it would be against the financial interests of our shareholders and would not help to mitigate global warming.</p><p>This year, we are again asking shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on the progress we have made in 2022 as we implement our energy transition strategy. As in previous years, this vote on our progress measured against our targets and plans is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe the progress we have made in line with our energy transition strategy has been to the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and wider society. The Board recommends that you vote in favour of Resolution 25 in support of the energy transition progress that Shell made in 2022, as described in this report and in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022.</p><p>[A] According to our analysis and data from the International Energy Agency.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer's introduction</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has had significant effects on the global energy system, with many countries needing to replace the supplies of natural gas that previously came from Russia.</p><p>Governments acted swiftly. The European Union's REPowerEU plan and the Inflation Reduction Act in the USA gave strong support to renewable energy. In Germany, two floating storage and regasification terminals were up and running by the end of the year, allowing the country to import more of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) it needs.</p><p>But the energy system still faces huge challenges as high energy prices continue to contribute to a cost-of-living crisis for many people. These challenges have highlighted the need for a balanced energy transition: one in which the world achieves net-zero emissions, while still providing a secure and affordable supply of energy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supplying vital energy</emphasis></p><p>In this report, we show the progress we have made towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, as we continue to supply the vital energy the world needs during a time of great volatility.</p><p>I am especially proud of the progress we have made in reducing carbon emissions from our operations, with a 30% reduction by the end of 2022, compared with 2016 on a net basis. That puts us more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030.</p><p>We also continued to change the energy mix of our portfolio. By the end of 2022, the net carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell had fallen by 3.8%, compared with 2016. Our analysis, using data from the International Energy Agency, shows the net carbon intensity of the global energy system fell by around 2% over that time [A].</p><p>Beyond our immediate performance against our targets, we have taken other important steps to advance our strategy. In LNG, for example, we expanded what is already a world-leading business. We expect that LNG will play a key role in a balanced energy transition. It produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, and fewer emissions than petrol or diesel when used as a fuel for transport.</p><p>In 2022, we joined two exciting projects in Qatar, including what will be the largest LNG project in the world. These projects will use carbon capture and storage, helping to reduce emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investing in low-carbon projects</emphasis></p><p>At the same time, we made significant moves to increase our supply of low- and zero-carbon energy, in line with our strategy. In 2022, we invested $1.6 billion in Indian renewable power developer Sprng Energy. We also announced the acquisition of Denmark's Nature Energy, which produces renewable natural gas from agricultural, industrial and household waste, for around $2 billion.</p><p>Our Powering Progress strategy is designed to transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. We will use the strength of our brand, customer relationships and balance sheet to add value to these acquisitions.</p><p>With Nature Energy, for example, we expect to make strong returns from our investment because we already have customers for biofuels in commercial road transport and shipping, and the trading expertise to connect opportunities in supply and demand.</p><p>[A] For more details see shell.com/energytransitionfaq</p><p>Similarly, the strength of our integrated portfolio gives us confidence in our investment in Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be Europe's largest renewable hydrogen plant. The power for the electrolyser will come from an offshore wind farm that is partly owned by Shell. The renewable hydrogen will be used at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to help decarbonise the production of products like petrol, diesel and aviation fuel. Renewable hydrogen can also be used for commercial road transport, a sector where we already have a leading position in Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building on our strengths</emphasis></p><p>In 2022, we invested $8.2 billion in low-carbon energy and non-energy products, around a third of our total cash capital expenditure. Of that, we invested $4.3 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, including biofuels, hydrogen, charging for electric vehicles and renewable power generation. The remaining $3.9 billion was spent on non-energy products such as chemicals, lubricants and convenience retail, which do not produce emissions when they are used by our customers.</p><p>As we invest in the energy transition, we will continue to build on our competitive strengths. We will earn the trust of investors and the right to grow these emerging businesses by demonstrating that we can deliver strong returns.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shareholder support</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, 89% of shareholders at our Annual General Meeting voted in favour of Shell's energy transition strategy, which centres on our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. As you will read in this report, we have made good progress in the first two years of that strategy by reducing emissions from our operations, and by making more low- and zero-carbon products available to our customers. Today, I ask our shareholders for their continued support, by voting in favour of the progress we are making on our journey to net-zero emissions.</p><p>Steps on the path to net-zero emissions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In 2023, for the second time, we are offering shareholders an advisory vote on our progress in implementing our energy transition strategy.

In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.</p><p>To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:</p><p>making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining integrated refineries into low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;using more renewable electricity to power our operations; anddeveloping carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities.</p><p>If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies which reduce carbon emissions. Following divestment activity in 2022, we expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2023 and 2030 and that they will exceed reductions associated with planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions</emphasis></p><p>Scope 1 and 2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A],[B]</p><p>The 2016 Base Year was not recalculated in 2022.

Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) decreased from 60 million tonnes of\u00a0carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2021 to 51 million tonnes CO2e\u00a0in\u00a02022. This reduction was achieved through divestments in 2021 and 2022 (such as the Deer Park and Puget Sound refineries in the USA) and the handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; shutdowns or conversion of existing assets, including the shutdown of\u00a0some units at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore; GHG abatement projects and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by the commissioning of Shell Polymers Monaca.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

In 2022, we reduced total methane emissions from our operations by 27% to 40,000 tonnes, compared with 55,000 tonnes in 2021. Our target to keep methane emissions intensity below 0.2% was met in\u00a02022 with Shell's overall methane emissions intensity at 0.05% for facilities with marketing gas and 0.01% for facilities without marketing gas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Routine flaring</emphasis></p><p>In 2022, routine flaring from our upstream operations fell to 0.1 million tonnes of hydrocarbons from 0.2 million tonnes of hydrocarbons in the previous year. Our aim is to eliminate routine gas flaring from our upstream operations by 2025.</p><p>Net carbon intensity</p><p>We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress in changing the mix of energy products we sell to customers. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services -- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Net carbon intensity measures the transformation that is happening in our portfolio as we implement our energy transition strategy. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is the same as achieving 100% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>[A] Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aligning our targets with Paris</emphasis></p><p>Shell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce our carbon intensity, measured using our net carbon intensity metric. We believe these targets are aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway derived from the scenarios used in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR 1.5), most of which show the global energy system reaching net zero between 2040 and 2060.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets with the temperature limit goal of the Paris Agreement. In the absence of a broadly accepted standard, we have developed our own approach for demonstrating Paris alignment by setting carbon intensity targets within a pathway derived from the IPCC SR 1.5 scenarios. This pathway is aligned with the more ambitious temperature goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.</p><p>When constructing the pathway, we started by filtering out certain scenarios to ensure that Shell's targets are aligned with earlier action and low-overshoot scenarios. Overshoot refers to the extent to which a scenario exceeds an emissions budget and subsequently relies on sinks to compensate for the excess emissions. Next, we calculated the carbon intensity (grammes of CO2/MJ of energy) for each of the remaining scenarios by dividing net emissions by total final energy consumption, with electricity represented as a fossil fuel equivalent.</p><p>To set a starting point, we then indexed the resulting carbon intensities to a common value of 100 in 2016 to remove the impact of differences between Shell's historical net carbon intensity and the intensities calculated from the IPCC scenarios. Finally, the pathway was constructed using the range of carbon intensity reductions over time. Outlying values at the top and bottom of the range were removed, which had the effect of narrowing the final pathway.</p><p>By using the 1.5\u00b0C pathway produced by this approach to set our targets, we aligned them with the necessary reduction in carbon intensity shown in the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. This is illustrated in the table, which shows that our targets are positioned within the range of the 1.5\u00b0C pathway. The upper and lower limits represent the upper and lower boundaries of the 1.5\u00b0C pathway derived using the approach described above.</p><p>Until 2035, our calculation of the total net emissions of each scenario includes only the expected mitigation actions by Shell, such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting using natural sinks. Any use of offsets included in the carbon-neutral energy products we offer our customers is also part of our calculation. After that date, we include mitigation actions taken separately by our customers. This is because we expect that customers will need to take action to mitigate their emissions from the use of our products if society is to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>To account for reductions in emissions across full energy value chains it is necessary to build new protocols to include mitigation actions by both energy suppliers and users. Currently, energy suppliers report the Scope 3 emissions from the use of their products, which are equivalent to the Scope 1 emissions reported by the users of those products. However, when users of energy products mitigate their Scope 1 emissions by the use of carbon capture and storage or offsets there is no protocol for reflecting a corresponding reduction in the Scope 3 emissions reported by the energy supplier. We will continue to engage stakeholders on these carbon protocols and will seek to align with new frameworks as they evolve.</p><p>As an energy provider, Shell has set a target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 20% by 2030. We believe that this target is aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway derived from the IPCC SR 1.5 scenarios. We also believe that the pace of change will vary around the world by region and by sector, taking into consideration the time needed for energy users to invest in large-scale equipment, and the energy infrastructure changes needed for Shell to deliver more low- and zero-carbon energy.</p><p>Reducing carbon intensity</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart below illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>Net carbon intensity in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Electricity sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable electricity. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon intensity performance</emphasis></p><p>In 2022, Shell's NCI was 76 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 1.3% decrease from the previous year and a 3.8% reduction compared with 2016, the reference year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2022 was primarily due to an increased proportion of renewable power and corresponding reduction in the carbon intensity of our power sales. Shell's 2022 NCI includes 4.1 million tonnes of carbon credits, compared with 5.1 million tonnes\u00a0which were included in Shell's 2021 NCI.

Once operational, the plant will produce 100,000 tonnes of bio-LNG each year. In the Netherlands, Shell became the first fuel retailer to offer bio-LNG blended with regular LNG to all its customers. Trucks using this blend emit around 30% less CO2.</p><p>In the aviation sector, we became the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore in February 2022. By the end of the year we were supplying SAF to airlines at seven airports around the world.

The volatility caused by Russia's war in Ukraine has highlighted the need for a global supply of secure and affordable energy. We continue to supply the conventional fuels needed to help meet this demand, including natural gas and traditional fuels (such as fuel oil, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel), while lowering emissions from our own operations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natural gas</emphasis></p><p>In 2022, as one of the world's largest suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), we shipped natural gas to where it was needed most. We delivered 194 cargoes of LNG to Europe - almost five times our usual average. In total, we sold 66.0 million tonnes of LNG in 2022 compared with 64.2 million tonnes in 2021.</p><p>LNG plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a lower-carbon alternative. For example, combined-cycle gas turbines emit about 50% less CO2per unit of electricity generated than an average coal-fired power plant, according to the IEA. LNG also helps to decarbonise shipping operations and commercial road transport. In 2022, we completed more than 250 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations. We provide LNG to ships at 15 ports in 10 countries. We also expanded our LNG refuelling network to more than 60 operated sites, bringing the number of sites where Shell customers can access LNG in Europe to more than 160.</p><p>Shell was selected as a partner in two projects in Qatar: the expansion of the North Field East, which is the largest LNG project in the world, and the North Field South project [A]. By using carbon capture and storage, these landmark projects will help provide LNG with a lower carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these two projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later in the decade.</p><p>In 2022, we also took final investment decisions to develop offshore gas projects in Malaysia, the UK and Australia. One of them, the Rosmari-Marjoram project, situated 220 kilometres off the coast of Malaysia, will mainly be powered by renewable energy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Traditional fuels</emphasis></p><p>From exploration to refining and distribution, traditional fuels continue to play a key role in the energy system. We estimate that our oil production peaked in 2019. In 2022, our crude oil and natural gas liquids production available for sale was 13% lower than in the previous year. This larger than usual decline was mainly driven by portfolio changes, including the sale of our Permian business in late 2021 and the derecognition of volumes related to Sakhalin in Russia.</p><p>In 2022, we continued the transformation of our integrated refineries into Energy and Chemicals Parks. This involves developing new facilities and converting or dismantling existing units. We plan to process less crude oil and use more renewable and recycled feedstocks such as hydrogen, biofuels and plastic waste. In the USA, we completed the sale of our Mobile refinery in Alabama and of our interest in the Deer Park refinery in Texas.</p><p>We have implemented a variety of measures to reduce the energy use and increase the energy efficiency of our operations, with estimated total savings of around 1,155\u00a0million kilowatt hours (kWh). Please refer to the \"Our journey to net zero\" section in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 for examples of the measures we took in 2022.</p><p>Our conventional fuels activities are part of our Upstream, Marketing, Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products business segments.</p><p>[A] Shell participation in the North Field South project remains subject to clearance of remaining customary conditions precedent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy transition in Action: a selection of 2022 developments (map)</emphasis></p><p>Investments and returns</p><p>Since the first quarter of 2022, we have reported separately on the performance of our five business segments [A]:</p><p>Our Marketing business has targeted returns of 15-25%. It comprises Mobility, Lubricants, and Sectors and Decarbonisation. Mobility operates Shell's retail network, including electric vehicle charging services. Lubricants produces, markets and sells lubricants for road transport, and machinery used in manufacturing, mining, power generation, agriculture and construction. Sectors and Decarbonisation sells fuels, speciality products and services, including energy solutions that help customers reduce emissions in the aviation, marine, commercial road transport and agricultural sectors, among others.Our Renewables and Energy Solutions business has targeted returns of more than 10% [B]. It includes renewable power generation, the marketing and trading of power and pipeline gas, as well as carbon credits, and digitally enabled customer solutions. Renewables and Energy Solutions also includes the production and marketing of hydrogen, development of commercial carbon capture and storage hubs, investment in nature-based projects that avoid or reduce carbon emissions (Nature-based solutions), and Shell Ventures, which invests in companies that work to accelerate the energy and mobility transformation.Our Integrated Gas business has targeted returns of 14-18%. It includes liquefied natural gas (LNG), conversion of natural gas into gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuels and other products. It includes natural gas and liquids exploration and extraction, and the operation of the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver these to market. Integrated Gas also includes the marketing, trading and optimisation of LNG, including LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles. Our Chemicals and Products business has targeted returns of 10-15%. It includes chemicals manufacturing plants with their own marketing network, and refineries which turn crude oil and other feedstocks into a range of oil products. These are moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use. The business also includes pipelines, trading of crude oil, oil products and petrochemicals, and oil sands activities, which involves the extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and its conversion into synthetic oil.Our Upstream business has targeted returns of 20-25%. It explores for and extracts crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil and gas, and operates the infrastructure necessary to deliver them to the market. Shell's Upstream business delivers reliable energy from conventional oil and gas operations, as well as deep-water exploration and production activities. We are focusing our Upstream portfolio to become more resilient, prioritising value over volume to provide the energy the world needs today whilst funding the energy system of tomorrow.</p><p>For all these businesses, our target returns consider the risks and uncertainties associated with our investments, and the scale of spending that is required to develop opportunities. For example, in our Upstream business, they reflect the costs of exploration, feasibility studies and construction, as well as risks linked to commodity prices.</p><p>In 2022, our cash capital expenditure [C] was around $25 billion and our operating expenses were around $39 billion. The table below shows how much we spent and the cash flow from operations in 2021 and 2022 across our businesses.</p><p>[A] On January 31, 2023, we announced that our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses will be combined to form a new Integrated Gas and Upstream Directorate. The Downstream business will be combined with Renewables and Energy Solutions to form a new Downstream and Renewables Directorate. These changes are expected to take effect on July 1, 2023 and will not affect Shell's financial reporting segments in 2023.

Of that, we invested $4.3 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, an increase of 89% compared with the previous year. This includes capital spending on biofuels, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles, as well as wind and solar power [B]. The remaining $3.9 billion was invested in non-energy products such as chemicals, lubricants and convenience retail, which do not produce emissions when they are used by our customers. Our investment in non-energy products decreased by 9% compared with 2021.</p><p>These investments advance a central part of our strategy which is to sell more products with low-carbon emissions to help both Shell and our customers meet their climate targets.</p><p>Two-thirds of our capital spending in 2022 was on maintaining supplies of the vital energy the world needs today. We invested $4.2 billion in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as well as gas and power marketing and trading, an increase of 17% compared with the previous year. We expect LNG will remain an important part of the energy mix for many years to come because of its role in reducing emissions from power generation and transport.</p><p>We also increased our investments in oil production and oil products by 30% to $12.5 billion. This includes investments of $8.1 billion in our Upstream business, helping maintain our assets and make up for the natural decline in oil and gas production. It also includes investments in refining and trading, as well as fuels marketing, which are important to maintain supplies of fuels for motorists, commercial road transport, aviation and industry.</p><p>[A] Please refer to the Annual Report and Accounts 2022 for the definition of cash capital expenditure.</p><p>[B] The $4.3 billion investment does not include the acquisition of Nature Energy for around $2 billion, which closed at the beginning of 2023.</p><p>Products for which usage does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions: Lubricants, Chemicals, Convenience Retailing, Agriculture &amp; Forestry, Construction &amp; Road.E-Mobility and Electric Vehicle Charging Services, Low-Carbon Fuels (Biofuels/HEFA), Renewable Power Generation (Solar/Wind), Environmental Solutions, Hydrogen, CCUS.

Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.</p><p>We advocate directly to governments and policy maker<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">s</emphasis>, offering relevant information, views, and policy recommendations on new proposals. For example, Shell supports the European Union's Fit for 55 package, which aims to enable the EU's transition to climate neutrality by 2050. As part of our engagements with the EU institutions in 2022, we called for binding targets in the Renewable Energy Directive to accelerate the use of renewable hydrogen in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and transport by 2030.</p><p>We engage governments and policymakers indirectly, for example through our participation in coalitions and industry associations. We recognise that industry associations may represent many members and sometimes we may have different views on a topic. We join coalitions where there is likely to be a common advocacy objective.</p><p>In the USA, for example, Shell supported the US Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in 2022. We advocated different clean energy provisions, such as expanded tax credits for carbon capture utilisation and storage, and the creation of a tax credit for hydrogen production. We engaged with Members of Congress and the Biden Administration directly, as well as through advocacy coalitions, including the CEO Climate Dialogue, the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition and the Carbon Capture Coalition.</p><p>In India, we continued to engage with the government, industry partners, think tanks and academic institutions to collectively find ways to promote low-carbon energy choices. In 2022, we launched a carbon capture utilisation and storage industry coalition with our partners. It aims to encourage the creation of government policies to support the development of carbon capture and storage projects in India.</p><p>We also aim to help shape the wider debate around the energy transition in other ways, including through speeches and articles. Ahead of a meeting of the EU Parliament in June 2022, for example, Shell published an opinion piece on the European news website Euractiv. We supported the proposal to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the European Union from 2035, which was agreed a few months later.</p><p>We aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around climate and energy-transition-related policy engagement. We set out our approach, policy and advocacy positions, and information about our industry association memberships, on our website.</p><p>In March 2023, we plan to publish our first Climate and Energy Transition Lobbying Report. This report reviews our lobbying in 2022 and our memberships of industry associations. We continue to work to ensure our memberships of industry associations support our climate and energy transition policy positions.</p><p>Read more at<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vsW6uMDzC6Ch9PVs1IPpVxazDjmyooa1HTVMJBQRq0lJrfaAiFg7baqmz6AoZCfvDQRXY_hNMmEv_Pm-nSD9jA==\">w</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=W6HngVxsZ0IdVhHD2B1eDrtB_QcEdFW3PGpBLmrydKR3QwgxQd99Lt6zQ7ldsPYK2KnBZEgaTtvPxDjblFpg-2lETy5vU-pvCVJB4t9zjzU=\">ww.shell.com/advocacy</url></p><p>Climate governance</p><p>Our climate governance ensures our strategy, processes and incentives are aligned to drive our progress in the energy transition.</p><p>In 2022, the Board continued to consider energy transition matters throughout the year when reviewing and guiding the implementation of our Powering Progress strategy, assessing the risk management policies in place, and challenging and endorsing the business plans and budgets - including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.</p><p>To foster the delivery of our strategy, we have further aligned staff remuneration with progress in the energy transition, by making changes to the annual bonus scorecard, which helps determine bonus outcomes for most Shell employees, including Executive Committee members.</p><p>From 2022, we introduced new metrics to the measure called Shell's Journey in the Energy Transition (15% of the annual bonus scorecard). These are:</p><p>Selling lower carbon products - we help customers to reduce their emissions by supplying low-carbon products. We measure our success by the earnings share of our Marketing activities from low-carbon energy products as well as non-energy products and convenience retail. Reducing operational emissions - our target is to achieve a 50% reduction by 2030; and this measure is based on reducing our Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions. Partnering to decarbonise - we seek to collaborate with our customers to help them reduce their emissions. In 2022, we measured success in this area in terms of our progress in rollingout our electric vehicle charging network.</p><p>We also introduced a customer excellence measure on the annual bonus scorecard, to emphasise the importance of building ever stronger customer relationships in the energy transition.</p><p>Our Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) and Performance share plan (PSP) tie pay for around 16,500 employees directly to achieving our strategic ambitions for the energy transition. From 2019 onwards, we have included an energy transition performance metric in our LTIP.

The table below shows how Shell was assessed in the October 2022 Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark.</p><p>The Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) benchmark uses assessments by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI). In its assessment, TPI highlights that it has recalculated Shell's net carbon intensity according to its own methodology. It also highlights that Shell has set further targets to reduce its net carbon intensity, but they were not included in this assessment as it was not possible to make them consistent with TPI's methodology.</p><p>We are pleased to see that our ratings have improved in two areas in the latest assessment, but we continue to be disappointed with certain key aspects of the assessment due to differences in the methodologies used. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their Benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment.</p><p>Climate litigation and activism</p><p>During the past decade, environmental activists have increasingly used litigation to hold governments and companies accountable for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. Shell is involved in more than 20 such court cases worldwide.</p><p>In March 2022, we appealed a ruling by the District Court of The Hague in the Netherlands from May 2021, which requires Shell to reduce emissions further and faster than even the most ambitious energy scenarios published for the sectors in which we operate. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, we are taking active steps to comply with the ruling. We believe the actions we are taking to deliver our energy transition strategy are consistent with the court ruling and its end of 2030 timeline. This includes the investments we are making in low-carbon fuels, renewable power, and hydrogen; in addition to making changes to our upstream and refinery portfolios.</p><p>In February 2023, environmental law group ClientEarth filed a claim with the High Court in England against Shell plc and the current Board of Directors challenging the board's decision-making regarding Shell's climate strategy. This is a derivative action brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company. The High Court must grant permission for ClientEarth to proceed with the claim. Investors representing less than 0.2% of Shell's total shareholder base have sent letters supporting the claim. We do not accept ClientEarth's allegations. We believe our directors have complied with their legal duties and have, at all times, acted in the best interests of the Company.</p><p>We agree there is an urgent need to change the world's energy system. We believe it is for governments to determine the right trade-offs for society and to put in place the policies that bring about fundamental changes in the way society consumes energy. Litigation does not enable the global cooperation required to change both supply and demand for energy, as well as the infrastructure supporting the use of energy.</p><p>Shell is determined to play its part in helping to change the world's energy system. We believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5<sup>o</sup>C above pre-industrial levels. Importantly, we have already delivered results: Shell reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control in 2022 by 30% compared with 2016.</p><p>Some shareholders, such as Follow This, have also called on us to set even more ambitious targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions. This is also a focus of some of the climate litigation against us.</p><p>Shell would, among other things, have to decrease its sales of oil products and gas to reduce its Scope 3 emissions in line with the Follow This resolution. Doing so, without changing demand and the way our customers use energy, would effectively mean handing over customers to competitors. This would materially affect Shell's financial strength and limits its ability to generate value for shareholders. It would also reduce our ability to play an important role in the energy transition by working with customers to reduce their emissions.</p><p>We are making progress in implementing our energy transition strategy, which we believe is the best for society, our customers and our shareholders.

This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact.

Speaking at a panel organized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) tomorrow, Nourdine Bihmane, Global Chief Delivery Officer and Head of Net-Zero Transformation at Atos, will make the case for digital, not only as an enabler of the transition to net-zero but as a key accelerator of this process. Ahead of the panel event, Nourdine Bihmane said:\"I believe a net-zero future is possible, but we must take bold action on a global scale. On this journey that we need to accelerate, digital is a lever to support both private and public sectors. Data is at the center of this, to make accurate and timely decisions to\u00a0measure,\u00a0reduce and then remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere. At Atos, we have developed an\u00a0end-to-end portfolio leveraging both technology and nature-based solutions to support this critical transition for our clients. Over the course of COP26, Atos will:Engage with global business leaders from the technology sector, public sector, and other industries to improve knowledge of the scale of the sustainability challenge and discuss how they can work collaboratively to tackle it. This work is supported by arecent annual reportfromEcoAct, an Atos company, which includes Climate Reporting Performance analysis ranking the top 20 companies in the FTSE 100, DOW 30 and EURO STOXX 50 for climate disclosure, helping businesses in the decarbonization space understand how they are performing against their climate goals. Take a central role in the DEFRA Tech for Climate Action to examine and propose technologies and innovations for building resilience, mitigating emissions, and achieving net-zero by 2050 in alignment with the IPCC recommendations, as well as the vital role secure digital tools play in cutting carbon emissions. Propose concrete action through innovation such as Terra\u00b2; a pioneering mobile application that provides valuable climate data enabling decision makers and influencers to make data-driven decisions, supporting the COP26 ambition. Atos provides a backdrop to COP26 action with Digital Vision: COP26 - its recent opinion paper examining how organizations in every sector can harness digital technology to accelerate progress to net-zero targets and shape a sustainable future, with contributions from Atos experts and senior figures in business and politics."]}, {"relevance_score": 41, "title": "How environmental reporting can help in fighting climate change", "published": "2021-11-25", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Companies must measure and disclose the impact they have on our environment.

Starting next month, the company will begin making the nutritional value of its global portfolio transparent, using an external, internationally recognized model for reporting. Nestl\u00e9 will also start reporting on local portfolios in 14 countries, using local external benchmarks. In addition, Nestl\u00e9 recently strengthened its responsible marketing practices, voluntarily restricting its marketing to kids under the age of 16. The company wants to be at the forefront of the industry when it comes to bringing balanced diets within reach for people around the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On 'Good for the Planet'</emphasis>, Nestl\u00e9's greenhouse gas emissions are now below the 2018 levels, based on SBTi standards, even as the company has continued to grow since then. The biggest part of Nestl\u00e9's emissions come from activities within its supply chain (Scope 3), which is why the company is heavily focused on reducing them through the sourcing of its raw materials and regenerative agriculture. It is working with farmers all over the world to help them make the transition to regenerative agriculture. It is sourcing more volumes from farmers who make that transition, while providing technical and financial support to help other farmers start. Through the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030, for example, Nestl\u00e9 is piloting a financial support scheme to encourage coffee farmers to accelerate the shift.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 is also tackling the emissions it has more direct control over (Scope 1 and 2). It is using its R&amp;D expertise and innovation capabilities to adapt recipes to lower the emissions of new and established products. Nestl\u00e9 is becoming more energy efficient and ramping up its use of renewable electricity. In fact, the company is on track to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025. In North America, for example, Nestl\u00e9 completed a large-scale solar energy farm and invested in two more. Combined, the solar energy farms will supply approximately 80% of Nestl\u00e9's energy in the U.S. and reduce its carbon emissions by 3.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalents.</p><p>Additionally, Nestl\u00e9 is implementing nature-based solutions where it sources its raw materials to remove emissions and store them in the ground. In Nicaragua, for instance, the company reached its 2022 goal of planting one million trees, as part of a six-year reforestation project to plant 8.6 million trees on the Nescaf\u00e9 and dairy farms from which Nestl\u00e9 sources. The project is estimated to capture about 3.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalents over 20 years. It is expected to improve biodiversity and forest connectivity, to protect water sheds and to provide job opportunities.</p><p>Outlook</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023 outlook:</emphasis>we expect organic sales growth between 6% and 8% and underlying trading operating profit margin between 17.0% and 17.5%.

In Europe\u00a0sea levels could reach 37cm by 2080, causing land loss that threatens infrastructure, livelihoods and heritage sites</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As climate change causes sea levels to rise around the world, typically it is small island nations that sound the alarm at events like COP26.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley told attendees at the conference in Glasgow that a 2-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures would cause an increase in sea levels equivalent to a \"death sentence\" for the Caribbean island. Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe stood knee-deep in the sea around the South Pacific island to illustrate the scale of the problem as he filmed a video statement to send to the summit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in Europe too, climate change is having a dramatic impact on the shoreline as rising seas mean waves hit the coast at higher levels, and increasing storms and changes in wind direction join forces to wear land away.</p><p>Part of the problem is that coastal populations and human infrastructure is increasing around the world, even though the coastline naturally fluctuates, Larissa Naylor, professor of geomorphology and environmental geography at the University of Glasgow, told FRANCE 24. \"The issue is that we've fixed the coast and we've fixed assets at the coast. Around Europe we've got hotels, roads, houses, railways along a boundary that is fluid.\"</p><p>Naylor says rising sea levels add an \"extra layer\" to factors already at play. For example, if a spring tide happens to coincide with a storm, the added complication of rising seas amplifies the overall impact. \"As climate change accelerates there's going to be much more loss and damage in these coastal contexts. Society will increasingly be impacted,\" she says.</p><p>Livelihoods and infrastructure at risk</p><p>This is happening faster in some areas than others.</p><p>On the Yorkshire coast in north-east England an annual average of four metres disappear each year, but last year figures from the local council showed that in a two-mile stretch, 10 metres disappeared in just nine months. Some 20 homes are thought to now be at risk of falling into the sea.</p><p>In Ireland, Irish Rail last month announced plans to invest millions to counter \"alarming\" rates of erosion near coastal railway lines, Irish daily The Journal reported.</p><p>Further south, livelihoods are at stake. A 2017 Greek study found that up to 88 percent\u00a0of all the country's beaches -- essential to the national tourism economy -- could be completely eroded by the end of the century, with large scale land losses also predicted in seaside resorts in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy.</p><p>Even so, data giving an overview of the situation on the continent is lacking. The last European Union study of coastal erosion dates back to 2004, when it found all countries with sea access in the EU were experiencing some form of coastal erosion and 20 thousand kilometres of coastline faced serious impacts.</p><p>Although rising seas and coastal erosion are a global problem, it poses a unique risk in Europe due to the continent's high ratio of shoreline to land. Yet there is no Europe-wide strategy for fighting coastal erosion and many nations do not have cohesive plans, instead leaving regional governments to work out -- and fund -- their own solutions.</p><p>This is partly because public awareness of the issue is lower than for issues like flooding, but also because tackling the problem means a change in approach, from fighting land loss to accepting it.</p><p>Naylor is a specialist in rocky coastlines that naturally erode more slowly than sandy beaches but are still disappearing. \"And once the rocky coastline goes, you can't glue it back on,\" she says. It is an impact that cannot be reversed or reduced, but needs to be accepted and adapted to. \"We're not necessarily ready to do that as a society,\"\u00a0Naylor says.</p><p>Accepting the inevitable</p><p>Some places have already started to do this. In Quiberville-sur-Mer in Normandy, Mayor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bloc told FRANCE 24 that in order to protect infrastructure close to the water's edge, the city used to rely on concrete fortifications at the bottom of its cliffs and a long, concrete drainage ditch separating the beach from the town, but these needed to be rebuilt and strengthened after each big storm.</p><p>\"As the water rises, and as the storms get stronger and stronger due to global warming, it's clear that this is not enough anymore,\" he said. \"We will not be able to keep going like we were\u00a0indefinitely.\"</p><p>Now the town plans to simply accept that the coast is moving,\u00a0and to let erosion happen, by relocating houses close to the coastline.</p><p>Further south on the French Atlantic coast, the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz is trialling a similar plan to manage coastal erosion of 25cm a year. Local officials have committed \u20ac6.4 million to moving at-risk campsites, restaurants, bars and a water purification station to safer\u00a0inland locations.</p><p>&gt;&gt; See also: Normandy village takes a gamble on letting in the rising sea</p><p>This approach brings its own challenges, Naylor says. \"How do we fund the moving of communities? How accepting are the communities inland of these people coming into their space?\"</p><p>As the scale of the issue grows, the difficulties of moving communities will have a greater impact on European countries' existing infrastructure and spending. She says:\u00a0\"The committee on climate change report for England has said that in 2018 there were 8,000 properties at risk of erosion in England and by 2100 it's going to be 100,000. That will be the same in other parts of Europe with soft coasts. How do we manage that as a society?\"</p><p>Protecting against change</p><p>Another option is building to protect existing land using what Naylor describes as a \"traditional conventional hard engineering approach\" or \"greener, nature-based solutions\".</p><p>In Malta, the capital city Valletta dates back to the 16th century and is one of 42 World Heritage Sites at risk of coastal erosion in the Mediterranean. Ten kilometres away the town of Marsaxlokk has opted for the first solution. Last month officials announced a \u20ac2 million effort to limit erosion by installing 70 metres of\u00a0groynes \u2013 temporary structures made of limestone bricks.</p><p>The limestone barrier will extend out from the dock into the sea, forming a protective wall to catch sand and other sediment that would otherwise be washed away from the shore.</p><p>This is similar to a technique used in Holland, where 12 million cubic metres\u00a0of sand are used to replace what gets washed away from the coastline. While groynes last up to 25 years, the sand must be replaced every year as the problem worsens. It is expected that greater volumes of sand will be needed, meaning greater costs.</p><p>Such systems can also be built in a more eco-friendly way to make them habitable for local species. Earlier this year Portsmouth, UK, announced plans to build a two kilometre sea defence wall that is habitable for rocky shore species, making it the largest structure of its kind in the UK. The issue here is the costs involved. \"It isn't just the cost of building it, there's repair and maintenance costs as well. It's phenomenal, eye-watering amounts of money,\" says Naylor.</p><p>She adds, \"We're not necessarily costing all the economic benefits over a long enough time. Yes, you can rebuild a wall now and it might only be a metre or two higher than the wall before, but what happens in 80 years' time? Who pays then? We need some requirements to start looking at long-term climate risk.\"</p><p>Adaption, loss and damage</p><p>She is hopeful such issues may be raised at COP26 on Monday, November 8, when talks are dedicated to adaptation, loss and damage.</p><p>One example she points to as successful is a recent project in Edinburgh to build blocks of flats on the water's edge. Instead, the contractors agreed to install a coastal park as a buffer between the sea and the new buildings. This meant making space for nature\u00a0and for erosion and accepting that, \"by accommodating erosion you lose some land\".</p><p>Putting this kind of change in attitude on the agenda and introducing government frameworks promoting such measures is crucial, Naylor says. \"Adaptation really needs to come up the agenda and be on an equal pegging to mitigation. If that happened it would help things like the need to adapt to coastal erosion become more mainstream.\"</p><p>As a recent study from the World Meteorological Organisation found that the rate sea rises have doubled to 4.4 since 1993, one thing that is certain is that more thoughtful and long-term solutions will be needed.</p><p>Fundamentally, Naylor says, it comes down to \"making decisions now that don't commit future generations to huge amounts of loss and damage\".</p>", "publisher": "FRANCE 24 (English)", "instances": ["How accepting are the communities inland of these people coming into their space?

These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ''Subsidiaries'', \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Royal Dutch Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively.

The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. This announcement contains the following forward-looking Non-GAAP measures: Adjusted Earnings, Cash capital expenditure, Underlying operating expenses, and Divestment proceeds. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of the above forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile the above Non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure is dependent on future events some which are outside the control of the company, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures consistent with the company accounting policies and the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Royal Dutch Shell plc's financial statements.</p><p>Also, in this announcement we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell.

We have experienced the devastation brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, and other challenges including climate change, which has caused economic downturn, increased poverty, slowed global recovery, and hindered the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>3. This year, we have also witnessed the war in Ukraine further adversely impact the global economy. There was a discussion on the issue. We reiterated our national positions as expressed in other fora, including the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly, which, in Resolution No. ES-11/1 dated 2 March 2022, as adopted by majority vote (141 votes for, 5 against, 35 abstentions, 12 absent) deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine. Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy - constraining growth, increasing inflation, disrupting supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, and elevating financial stability risks. There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions. Recognizing that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.</p><p>4. It is essential to uphold international law and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability. This includes defending all the Purposes and Principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and infrastructure in armed conflicts. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today's era must not be of war.</p><p>5. At today's critical moment for the global economy, it is essential that the G20 undertakes tangible, precise, swift and necessary actions, using all available policy tools, to address common challenges, including through international macro policy cooperation and concrete collaborations. In doing so, we remain committed to support developing countries, particularly the least developed and small island developing states, in responding to these global challenges and achieving the SDGs. In line with the Indonesian G20 Presidency theme  Recover Together, Recover Stronger  we will take coordinated actions to advance an agenda for a strong, inclusive and resilient global recovery and sustainable development that delivers jobs and growth. With the above in mind, we will:</p><p>Stay agile and flexible in our macro-economic policy responses and cooperation. We will make public investments and structural reforms, promote private investments, and strengthen multilateral trade and resilience of global supply chains, to support long-term growth, sustainable and inclusive, green and just transitions. We will ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, with our central banks committed to achieving price stability.<br/>Protect macroeconomic and financial stability and remain committed to using all available tools to mitigate downside risks, noting the steps taken since the Global Financial Crisis to strengthen financial resilience and promote sustainable finance and capital flows.<br/>Take action to promote food and energy security and support stability of markets, providing temporary and targeted support to cushion the impact of price increases, strengthening dialogue between producers and consumers, and increasing trade and investments for long-term food and energy security needs, resilient and sustainable food, fertilizer and energy systems.<br/>Unlock further investments for low- and middle-income and other developing countries, through a greater variety of innovative financing sources and instruments, including to catalyze private investment, to support the achievement of the SDGs. We ask the Multilateral Development Banks to bring forward actions to mobilize and provide additional financing within their mandates, to support achievement of the SDGs including through sustainable development and infrastructure investments, and responding to global challenges.<br/>Recommit to accelerate achievement of the SDGs, achieving prosperity for all through sustainable development.<br/>6. We are deeply concerned by the challenges to global food security exacerbated by current conflicts and tensions. We therefore commit to taking urgent actions to save lives, prevent hunger and malnutrition, particularly to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and call for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains. We commit to protect the most vulnerable from hunger by using all available tools to address the global food crisis. We will take further coordinated actions to address food security challenges including price surges and shortage of food commodities and fertilizers globally. Recalling the G20 efforts such as the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, we welcome global, regional, and national initiatives in support of food security, and in particular note the progress made by the UN Secretary General's Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, as well as the World Bank Group's and IMF's food security responses. We emphasize the importance of building on the G20 Matera Declaration, working together to sustainably produce and distribute food, ensure that food systems better contribute to adaptation and mitigation to climate change, and halting and reversing biodiversity loss, diversify food sources, promote nutritious food for all, strengthen global, regional, and local food value chains, and accelerate efforts to reduce food loss and waste. We will also implement the One Health approach, intensify research on food science and technology, and improve stakeholders' capacity along the food supply chains, particularly women, youth, smallholder, and marginal farmers as well as fishers.</p><p>7. We support the international efforts to keep food supply chains functioning under challenging circumstances. We are committed to addressing food insecurity by ensuring accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of food and food products for those in needs, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries. We reiterate our support for open, transparent, inclusive, predictable, and non-discriminatory, rules-based agricultural trade based on WTO rules. We highlight the importance of enhancing market predictability, minimizing distortions, increasing business confidence, and allowing agriculture and food trade to flow smoothly. We reaffirm the need to update global agricultural food trade rules and to facilitate trade in agricultural and food products, as well as the importance of not imposing export prohibitions or restrictions on food and fertilizers in a manner inconsistent with relevant WTO provisions. We are committed to sustained supply, in part based on local food sources, as well as diversified production of food and fertilizers to support the most vulnerable from the disruptions in food trade supply chain. We will avoid adversely impacting food security deliberately. We commit to facilitate humanitarian supplies for ensuring access to food in emergency situations and call on UN Member States and all relevant stakeholders with available resources to provide in-kind donations and resources to support countries most affected by the food crisis, as required and based on assessed needs by governments of affected countries. We continue to support the carve out of humanitarian activities from sanctions and call on all nations to support this aim, including through current efforts at the UN. We will continue to closely monitor the state of global food security and nutrition.</p><p>8. We welcome the T\u00fcrkiye and UN-brokered two Istanbul Agreements signed on 22 July 2022 and consisting of the Initiative on the Safe Transportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian Ports (Black Sea Grain Initiative) and the Memorandum of Understanding between the Russian Federation and the Secretariat of the United Nations on Promoting Russian Food Products and Fertilizers to the World Markets, on the unimpeded deliveries of grain, foodstuffs, and fertilizers/inputs from Ukraine and the Russian Federation, to ease tension and prevent global food insecurity and hunger in developing countries. We emphasize the importance of their full, timely and continued implementation by all relevant stakeholders, as well as the UN Secretary-General's calls for continuation of these efforts by the Parties. In this context we highlight other efforts that ensure the flow of agri-food goods such as the EU Solidarity Lanes and the Russian donations of fertilizers facilitated by the World Food Programme. Moreover, we take note of various initiatives addressing food insecurity such as the Arab Coordination Group initiative.</p><p>9. We are committed to supporting the adoption of innovative practices and technologies, including digital innovation in agriculture and food systems to enhance productivity and sustainability in harmony with nature and promote farmers and fishers' livelihoods and increase income, in particular smallholders by increasing efficiency, and equal access to food supply chains. We will promote responsible investments in agricultural research and science and evidence-based approaches. We will continue to strengthen the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) as an early warning tool, to enhance food and fertilizer/inputs market transparency, reduce market uncertainties, and support coordinated policy responses for food security and nutrition, through the sharing of reliable and timely data and information.</p><p>10. We ask the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Bank Group (WBG) to share with us the results of their mapping exercises on food insecurity, which will be consolidated in the future with inputs from technical experts and other relevant international organizations, and will provide a systemic analysis of responses to address food security. This will identify any major gaps in global responses; examine food and nutrition variables and funding; examine the supply and demand of fertilizers; build on the G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS); and identify any medium-term issues that require further technical and systemic analysis. The FAO and WBG will report back by the 2023 Spring Meetings.</p><p>11. We meet at a time of climate and energy crises, compounded by geopolitical challenges. We are experiencing volatility in energy prices and markets and shortage/disruptions to energy supply. We underline the urgency to rapidly transform and diversify energy systems, advance energy security and resilience and markets stability, by accelerating and ensuring clean, sustainable, just, affordable, and inclusive energy transitions and flow of sustainable investments. We stress the importance of ensuring that global energy demand is matched by affordable energy supplies. We reiterate our commitment to achieve global net zero greenhouse gas emissions/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century, while taking into account the latest scientific developments and different national circumstances. We call for continued support for developing countries, especially in the most vulnerable countries, in terms of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy, capacity building, affordable latest technology within the public domain, mutually beneficial technology cooperation and financing mitigation actions in the energy sector.</p><p>12. We reaffirm our commitment to achieve SDG 7 targets and strive to close the gaps in energy access and to eradicate energy poverty. Recognising our leadership role, and guided by the Bali Compact and the Bali Energy Transition Roadmap, we are committed to finding solutions to achieve energy markets stability, transparency, and affordability. We will accelerate transitions and achieve our climate objectives by strengthening energy supply chain and energy security, and diversifying energy mixes and systems. We will rapidly scale up the deployment of zero and low emission power generation, including renewable energy resources, and measures to enhance energy efficiency, abatement technologies as well as removal technologies, taking into account national circumstances. We recognise the importance to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation, including renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power, in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards just transitions. We will increase our efforts to implement the commitment made in 2009 in Pittsburgh to phase-out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable. We will strengthen international cooperation as well as relevant producer-consumer dialogues on securing energy affordability and accessibility by limiting volatility in energy prices and scaling up clean, safe, inclusive, and sustainable technologies, including developing regional energy interconnectivity. We are committed to promote investment in sustainable infrastructure and industry, as well as innovative technologies and a wide range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms to support clean energy transitions, including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable.</p><p>13. Mindful of our leadership role, we reaffirm our steadfast commitments, in pursuit of the objective of UNFCCC, to tackle climate change by strengthening the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and its temperature goal, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances. We will play our part fully in implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact and the relevant outcomes of previous COPs and CMAs, in particular COP 26, including the call to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in our NDCs, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement. In this regard, we welcome enhanced climate actions resulting from the new or updated NDCs and invite parties to urgently scale up mitigation and adaptation ambition and means of implementation as well as make progress on loss and damage at COP 27 which is being held in Africa. Noting the IPCC assessments that the impact of climate change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C compared with 2\u00b0C, we resolve to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. This will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries, taking into account different approaches, through the development of clear national pathways that align long-term ambition with short and medium-term goals, and with international cooperation and support, including finance and technology, and sustainable and responsible consumption and production as critical enablers, in the context of sustainable development.</p><p>14. We welcome the progress to date towards achieving a Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). We urge all parties and countries to finalize and adopt the GBF with the view of realizing of 2050 Vision of \"Living in harmony with Nature\" at the second part of COP15 CBD as a strong framework of action and accountability for halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 and, as appropriate, to update National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans accordingly. We emphasize the importance of achieving and synergizing the objectives of the three Rio Conventions. We stress the need for clear and measurable goals and targets for biodiversity and means of implementation and accountability. We commit to strengthen actions to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and call on CBD Parties to adopt an ambitious, balanced, practical, effective, robust and transformative post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework at COP-15 in Montreal. We urge for increased resource mobilization from all sources, including from countries and entities, to provide new and additional financial resources for the implementation of the GBF, once it is negotiated, including to help enable and support developing country parties, and for aligning private and public financial flows with biodiversity objectives. We will scale up efforts to combat biodiversity loss, deforestation, desertification, land degradation and drought, as well as restoring degraded land to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030, and in support of the G20's ambition to reduce land degradation by 50% by 2040 on a voluntary basis. We recognize the effort made by a number of countries to ensure that at least 30% of global land and at least 30% of the global ocean and seas are conserved or protected by 2030 and we will help to make progress towards this objective in accordance with national circumstances. We commit to reduce environmental impacts by changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns as well as to enhance environmentally sound waste management including by preventing illegal cross-border traffic of waste.</p><p>15. We will step up efforts to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, including through Nature-based Solutions and Ecosystem-based Approaches, support climate mitigation and adaptation, enhance environmental conservation and protection, sustainable use and restoration, responding to natural disasters, reduce ecosystem degradation, enhance ecosystem services and to address issues affecting the marine and coastal environment. We will further promote sustainable development and lifestyles, resource efficiency and circular economy to increase sustainability and work together on scientific knowledge-sharing, raising awareness, and capacity building, particularly to advance on the ocean-based climate action. We are committed to ending illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We welcome the WTO multilateral Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies and encourage its rapid entry into force. In line with the UNEA Resolution 5/14, we are committed to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, with the ambition of completing the work by the end of 2024. We highlight the progress made and call on participating delegations to achieve an ambitious and balanced agreement without delay on an international legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, as called for in the UNGA Resolution 69/292. We also acknowledge that ecosystems, including forests, seagrasses, coral reefs, wetland ecosystems in all their diversity, including peatlands and mangrove, support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.</p><p>16. We acknowledge the urgent need to strengthen policies and mobilize financing, from all sources in a predictable, adequate and timely manner to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation including significantly increasing support for developing countries. We recall and further urge developed countries to fulfil their commitments to deliver on the goal of jointly mobilizing USD 100 billion per year urgently by 2020 and through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation. We also support continued deliberations on an ambitious new collective quantified goal of climate finance from a floor of USD 100 billion per year to support developing countries, that helps in fulfilling the objective of the UNFCCC and implementation of the Paris Agreement. We emphasize the importance of transparency in the implementation of the pledges. We also recall the Glasgow Climate Pact urging developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries, from 2019 levels, by 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled up financial resource, recalling Article 9 of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>17. In the context of strengthening global efforts to reach the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as implementing the COP26 commitments, we reiterate that our policy mix toward carbon neutrality and net zero should include a full range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives, and phase out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable, and in line with national circumstances. We acknowledge the macro-economic risks stemming from climate change and will continue discussions on the costs and benefits of different transitions.</p><p>18. We are committed to take actions in support of orderly, just and affordable transitions to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in line with the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement as well as with the convention on Biological Diversity. We welcome the progress made across the G20, international organizations, other international networks and initiatives, and the private sector in addressing the priorities of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which is voluntary and flexible in nature, and call for further efforts to advance the Roadmap's recommended actions that will scale up sustainability financing. We welcome the establishment of the Sustainable Finance Working Group's online dashboard and repository of relevant work, to illustrate ongoing and future progress made on the Roadmap, and encourage members to contribute on a voluntary basis, taking country circumstances into consideration. We endorse the 2022 G20 Sustainable Finance Report which articulates practical and voluntary recommendations for jurisdictions and relevant stakeholders in developing transition finance frameworks, improving the credibility of financial institutions' net zero commitments and scaling up sustainable finance instruments, with a focus on improving accessibility and affordability. We also welcome the valuable discussion during the Presidency's Forum on policy levers that incentivize financing and investment to support the transition.</p><p>19. We remain committed to promoting a healthy and sustainable recovery which builds towards achieving and sustaining Universal Health Coverage under the SDGs. While the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared monkeypox as another Public Health Emergency International Concern (PHEIC), reinforcing that international health threats are ever present and that the G20 and broader global community must come together to improve our collective prevention, preparedness and response capabilities. We reaffirm the importance of strengthening of national health systems by putting people at the center of preparedness and equip them to respond effectively. We emphasize the need for equitable access to pandemic medical countermeasures, and welcome the efforts of ACT-A, and note that the results of the ACT-A external evaluations can be useful lessons for future discussions. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen global health governance, with the leading and coordination role of WHO and support from other international organizations. We support the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) that will draft and negotiate a legally binding instrument that should contain both legally binding and non-legally binding elements to strengthen pandemic PPR and the working group on the International Health Regulations that will consider amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) mindful that the decision will be made by World Health Assembly.</p><p>20. The G20 High Level Independent Panel, as well as the WHO and World Bank have estimated there is an annual pandemic PPR financing gap of approximately USD 10 billion. As initiated by the Saudi Arabian G20 Presidency, the Italian G20 Presidency and continued by the Indonesian G20 Presidency, we welcome the provision of additional financial resources, to assist in financing critical gaps in implementing IHR (2005) and increase PPR capacities. In this regard, we welcome the establishment of a new Financial Intermediary Fund for Pandemic PPR (the \"Pandemic Fund') hosted by the World Bank. It aims to address critical pandemic PPR gaps and build capacity at national, regional and global levels, bring additionality in financial resources for pandemic PPR, catalyze complementary investments, and facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to pandemic PPR strengthening. We welcome the Pandemic Fund's inclusive membership and representation from low- and middle-income countries, civil society organizations and donors, and acknowledge the WHO's technical expertise and central coordination role in this endeavor, which reflects its leadership role in the global health architecture. We appreciate the work of the Secretariat hosted by the World Bank, with the WHO as technical lead and as chair of the Technical Advisory Panel. We look forward to the launch of the Pandemic Fund's first call for proposals as soon as possible. We commit to increase the capacity of developing countries for pandemic PPR through the Pandemic Fund, and look forward to the stocktaking review of the Pandemic Fund at the end of its first year to draw on lessons learned and incorporate any changes needed to ensure it is operating in accordance with its governing documents and effective at filling critical PPR gaps, and that it continues to have a central coordination role for the WHO, maintains a strong connection to the G20, and is inclusive of the perspectives of low- and middle-income countries and additional non-G20 partners in its decision making. We commend the pledges by current donors, amounting to over USD 1.4 billion, and encourage additional voluntary pledges. We call on new donors to join the Pandemic Fund, as they are able to.</p><p>21. It is essential to continue collaboration between Finance and Health Ministries for pandemic PPR. We extend the mandate of the Task Force, and ask the Secretariat of the Task Force to work with the Task Force co-chairs, the incoming Indian G20 Presidency, the G20 Troika, and G20 members to agree on a Task Force workplan for 2023, taking into account a multi-year planning horizon. We thank the WHO for continuing to host the Secretariat, with support from the World Bank. In 2023 the Task Force will continue to be co-chaired by Indonesia and Italy, representing advanced and emerging economy perspectives, and will continue to draw on expertise of the WHO, International Financial Institutions and other relevant organizations, with the support of the 2023 Indian G20 Presidency. To expand the voice of lower income countries we invite key regional organizations to join the Task Force meetings, as appropriate. We will work closely with the WHO to ensure the Task Force continues to complement the global pandemic PPR architecture and there is no further duplication and fragmentation of the global health governance system. Delivering on the mandate from the G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration, in 2023 the Task Force will continue developing coordination arrangements between Finance and Health Ministries, and share best practices and experiences from past finance-health coordination in order to develop joint responses to pandemics, as appropriate. The Task Force will undertake work to better understand economic risks and vulnerabilities from pandemics, and how to mitigate them, with a focus on finance and health coordination in response to new pandemics, considering country-specific circumstances and recognizing the importance of further work on resource mobilization. We ask the Task Force to report back to Finance and Health Ministers in 2023 on its progress.</p><p>22. We recognize that the extensive COVID-19 immunization is a global public good and we will advance our effort to ensure timely, equitable and universal access to safe, affordable, quality and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics (VTDs). Acknowledging the adoption of the Ministerial Declaration on the WTO Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparedness for Future Pandemics and the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement at the WTO's 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), we note that, no later than six months from the date of the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement, WTO members will decide on its extension to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics. We remain committed to embedding a multisectoral One Health approach and enhancing global surveillance, including genomic surveillance, in order to detect pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that may threaten human health. To enable global pathogen surveillance as part of our commitment to implement the IHR (2005), we encourage sharing of pathogen data in a timely manner on shared and trusted platforms in collaboration with WHO. We encourage sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of pathogens consistent with applicable national laws.</p><p>23. We recognize the need for strengthening local and regional health product manufacturing capacities and cooperation as well as sustainable global and regional research and development networks to facilitate better access to VTDs globally, especially in developing countries, and underscore the importance of public-private partnership, and technology transfer and knowledge sharing on voluntary and mutually agreed terms. We support the WHO mRNA Vaccine Technology Transfer hub as well as all as the spokes in all regions of the world with the objective of sharing technology and technical know-how on voluntary and mutually agreed terms. We welcome joint research and joint production of vaccines, including enhanced cooperation among developing countries. We acknowledge the importance of shared technical standards and verification methods, under the framework of the IHR (2005), to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability, and recognizing digital solutions and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations. We support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of the efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics, that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID-19 certificates.</p><p>24. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transformation of the digital ecosystem and digital economy. We recognize the importance of digital transformation in reaching the SDGs. We acknowledge that affordable and high-quality digital connectivity is essential for digital inclusion and digital transformation, while a resilient, safe and secure online environment is necessary to enhance confidence and trust in the digital economy. We recognize the importance of policies to create an enabling, inclusive, open, fair and non-discriminatory digital economy that fosters the application of new technologies, allows businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive, and protects and empowers consumers, while addressing the challenges, related to digital divides, privacy, data protection, intellectual property rights, and online safety. We acknowledge the importance to counter disinformation campaigns, cyber threats, online abuse, and ensuring security in connectivity infrastructure. We remain committed to further enable data free flow with trust and promote cross-border data flows. We will advance a more inclusive, human-centric, empowering, and sustainable digital transformation. We also reaffirm the role of data for development, economic growth and social well-being.</p><p>25. We encourage international collaboration to further develop digital skills and digital literacy to harness the positive impacts of digital transformation, especially for women, girls, and people in vulnerable situations, and further support efforts to develop reliable skills and literacy. We note the increasing demands for a workforce adept at utilizing emerging technologies, education and training, reskilling and upskilling to meet such demands. We also seek to increase connectivity by accelerating high capacity and secure infrastructure and provide more accessible and affordable resources and tools, while also improve the digital literacy skills of learners, teachers, school leaders, and other educational professional to ensure universal access to education, accelerate learning recovery and promote lifelong learning.</p><p>26. We found digital technology becomes the key for recovery and empowerment across various sectors, including in building a resilient and sustainable food system and agriculture, creating sustainable and decent jobs and human capacity development, supporting inclusive trade, industrialization and investment, increasing productivity, as well as opening up the potential of the future economy, especially for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups. It is essential to ensure that no one is left behind in our effort to digitally transform our society, by involving all stakeholders, including the youth, women, business sector, audit institution, parliaments, scientists, and labours.</p><p>27. We support continued implementation of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments, including the future delivery of the initial estimates for key performance indicators and 2022 Progress Report that sets out priorities for the next stage of work. We encourage central banks, other public authorities and the payments industry to continue to work collaboratively on these important initiatives to enhance cross-border payments. We welcome the report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) on interlinking payment systems and the role of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that was presented in a joint workshop by the Indonesian G20 Presidency in coordination with the BIS CPMI and the BIS Innovation Hub (BISIH) on cross-border payments and interoperability at the Festival Ekonomi Keuangan Digital Indonesia (FEKDI) 2022. We also welcome the joint report by the BIS CPMI, BISIH, IMF, and World Bank on options for access to and interoperability of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for cross-border payments.</p><p>28. We endorse the G20 Financial Inclusion Framework on Harnessing Digitalization to Increase Productivity and Foster a Sustainable and Inclusive Economy for Women, Youth and MSMEs or Yogyakarta Financial Inclusion Framework guided by the G20 2020 Financial Inclusion Action Plan. To address digitalization and sustainable finance developments, and support financial inclusion and well-being, we endorse the updated G20/OECD High-Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection and welcome the updated G20/OECD High-Level Principles on SME Financing.</p><p>29. To support our collective ambition to recover together, recover stronger, we commit to well-calibrated, well-planned, and well-communicated policies to support sustainable recovery, with due consideration to country-specific circumstances. We commit to mitigate scarring effects to support strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We will stay agile and flexible in our fiscal policy response, standing ready to adjust to the changing circumstances as needed. Temporary and targeted measures to help sustain the purchasing power of the most vulnerable and cushion the impact of commodity price increases, including energy and food prices, should be well designed to avoid adding to high inflationary pressures. We will continue to enhance macro policy cooperation, preserve financial stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, and safeguard against downside risks and negative spillovers. Macroprudential policies need to remain vigilant to guard against rising systemic risks as financial conditions tighten. Recognizing that many currencies have moved significantly this year with increased volatility, we reaffirm the commitments made on exchange rates by our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2021. We also reiterate the importance of global cooperation and express our appreciation to the Indonesian G20 Presidency for its efforts to maintain an effective system of multilateralism through the G20.</p><p>30. G20 central banks are strongly committed to achieving price stability, in line with their respective mandates. To that end, they are closely monitoring the impact of price pressures on inflation expectations and will continue to appropriately calibrate the pace of monetary policy tightening in a data-dependent and clearly communicated manner, ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored, while being mindful to safeguard the recovery and limit cross-country spillovers. Central bank independence is crucial to achieving these goals and buttressing monetary policy credibility.</p><p>31. We are committed to the swift implementation of the OECD/G20 two-pillar international tax package. We welcome the progress on Pillar One. We also welcome progress on Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules, which pave the way for consistent implementation at a global level as a common approach, and we look forward to the completion of the GloBE Implementation Framework. We call on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) to finalize Pillar One, including remaining issues and by signing the Multilateral Convention in the first half of 2023, and to complete the negotiations of the Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) under Pillar Two that would allow the development of a Multilateral Instrument for its implementation. We will work to strengthen the tax and development agenda in light of the July 2022 G20 Ministerial Symposium on Tax and Development, and we note the G20/OECD Roadmap on Developing Countries and International Tax. We support the progress made on implementing internationally agreed tax transparency standards, including regional efforts and welcome the signing of the Asia Initiative Bali Declaration in July 2022. We also welcome the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework and the amendments to the Common Reporting Standard, both of which we consider to be integral additions to the global standards for automatic exchange of information. We call on the OECD to conclude the work on implementation packages, including possible timelines, and invite the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to build on its commitment and monitoring processes to ensure widespread implementation of both packages by relevant jurisdictions.</p><p>32. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the long-term financial resilience of the international financial architecture, including by promoting sustainable capital flows, and developing local currency capital markets. We welcome the IMF's revised Institutional View on Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows and look forward to continued discussions with international organizations on the coherent implementation of international frameworks for the use of capital flow management measures, while being mindful of their original purpose. We look forward to further progress by the IMF in operationalizing the Integrated Policy Framework and welcome the report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on Macro-financial stability frameworks. We welcome continued exploration of how CBDCs could potentially be designed to facilitate cross-border payments, while preserving the stability and integrity of the international monetary and financial system. We welcome the successful completion of the G20 TechSprint 2022, a joint initiative with the BISIH, which has contributed to the debate on the most practical and feasible solutions to implement CBDCs. We reiterate our commitment to maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its center. We remain committed to revisiting the adequacy of quotas and will continue the process of IMF governance reform under the 16th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula as a guide, by 15 December 2023. We take note on the continuation of discussion of the IMF surcharge policy.</p><p>33. 1 We are committed to support all vulnerable countries to recover together, recover stronger. We welcome pledges amounting to USD 81.6 billion through the voluntary channelling of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or equivalent contributions, and call for further pledges from all willing and able countries to meet the total global ambition of USD 100 billion of voluntary contributions for countries most in need. We welcome the operationalization of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to help eligible low-income countries, small states and vulnerable middle-income countries address longer-term structural challenges that pose macroeconomic risks, including those stemming from pandemics and climate change. We welcome the voluntary contributions to the RST and call for additional pledges and timely contributions to it and to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), especially for subsidy resources, to ensure a broad pool of contributors to meet funding needs. We are open to explore viable options for countries to voluntarily channel SDRs through Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve assets status of SDRs. We will explore ways, including through balance sheet optimization measures, and other potential avenues, to maximize MDBs' development impact. We welcome early deliberations and urge MDBs to continue to discuss options for implementing the recommendations of the G20 Independent Review of MDBs' Capital Adequacy Frameworks within their own governance frameworks, and to deliver an update in Spring 2023. This will inform the ongoing development of a roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations, while safeguarding MDBs' long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings and preferred creditor status. We acknowledge the concluding report on the 2020 Shareholding Review of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and look forward to the 2025 Shareholding Review. At this challenging juncture, we reiterate our commitment to step up our efforts to implement the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner. We welcome progress in this regard, including the provision of financing assurances for Zambia. We welcome the conclusion of the debt treatment to Chad and encourage the timely conclusion of the debt treatment for Zambia by early 2023. We also encourage the conclusion of the debt treatment for Ethiopia under an IMF-supported program. We are concerned about the deteriorating debt situation in some vulnerable middle income countries. This could be addressed by multilateral coordination that involves all official and private bilateral creditors to take swift action to respond to their requests for debt treatments. We stress the importance for private creditors and other official bilateral creditors to commit to providing debt treatments on terms at least as favourable to ensure fair burden sharing in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We reaffirm the importance of joint efforts by all actors, including private creditors, to continue working toward enhancing debt transparency. We welcome the efforts of private sector lenders who have already contributed data to the joint Institute of International Finance (IIF)/OECD Data Repository Portal, and continue to encourage others to also contribute on a voluntary basis.</p><p>34. In the face of a more challenging global economic and financial outlook, we underline the need to reinforce global financial system resilience and ask the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and IMF to continue their monitoring efforts. We commit to sustaining global financial stability, including through continued coordination of policy measures and implementation of international standards. We welcome the FSB's final report on financial sector exit strategies and scarring effects of COVID-19 and its conclusions regarding financial stability issues by the end of 2022. We strongly support global policy actions to increase resilience, in particular against cross-border spillovers, including by addressing the identified structural vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) from a systemic perspective. To this end, we welcome the FSB's NBFI progress report with policy proposals to address systemic risk in NBFI, including in open-ended funds. We welcome the report by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on the review of margining practices. We support taking forward the implementation of the FSB updated Roadmap for addressing climate-related financial risks which complements the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. Globally consistent data are needed in order to effectively address climate-related financial risks. We look forward to the finalization of standards by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in support of globally consistent, comparable and reliable climate-related financial disclosures, and its work beyond climate, and we welcome the efforts to achieve interoperability across disclosure frameworks. We welcome the FSB progress report on achieving consistent and comparable climate-related financial disclosures and the final report on supervisory and regulatory approaches to climate-related risks. We welcome the report by the FSB and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) on climate-scenario analysis by jurisdictions.</p><p>35. We welcome ongoing work by the FSB and international standard setters to ensure that the crypto-assets ecosystem, including so-called stablecoins, is closely monitored and subject to robust regulation, supervision, and oversight to mitigate potential risks to financial stability. We welcome the FSB's proposed approach for establishing a comprehensive international framework for the regulation of crypto-asset activities based on the principle of \"same activity, same risk, same regulation'. We welcome the FSB consultative report on the review of its high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of \"global stablecoin\" arrangements. We also welcome the FSB consultation report on promoting international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches to crypto-assets activities and markets. It is critical to build public awareness of risks, to strengthen regulatory outcomes and to support a level playing field, while harnessing the benefits of innovation. We welcome the final guidance by the BIS CPMI and IOSCO which confirms that the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures apply to systematically important stablecoin arrangements. We welcome the FSB consultative report on achieving greater convergence in cyber incidents reporting, and look forward to the final report. We welcome the results of the second phase of the Data Gaps Initiative (DGI-2) and will continue to work with partners in addressing the identified remaining challenges. We welcome the workplan on the new Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) prepared by the IMF, FSB and the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics (IAG) in collaboration with participating members. We ask the IMF, the FSB and the IAG to begin work on filling these data gaps and report back on progress in the second half of 2023, noting that the targets are ambitious and delivery will need to take into account national statistical capacities, priorities, and country circumstances as well as avoiding overlap and duplication at international level. We welcome the progress of work on the review of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, including the second report and the ongoing public consultation, and look forward to further updates on the review.</p><p>36. We reaffirm that the rules-based, non-discriminatory, free, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable and transparent multilateral trading system (MTS), with the WTO at its core, is indispensable to advancing our shared objectives of inclusive growth, innovation, job creation and sustainable development in an open and interconnected world as well as to supporting the resilience and recovery of a global economy under strain due to COVID-19 and global supply chain disruption. We agree that reforming the WTO is key in strengthening trust in the MTS. We will continue to ensure a level playing field and fair competition to foster a favourable trade and investment environment for all. We note the importance of the contribution of the MTS to promote the UN 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. Commending the successful conclusion of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12), we commit to seize and advance the positive momentum by engaging in active, constructive, pragmatic, and focused discussions on WTO reform to improve all its functions, including reform of the dispute settlement mechanism, on the path leading to the MC13.</p><p>37. We are committed to reinforce international trade and investment cooperation to address supply chain issues and avoid trade disruptions. We believe that trade and climate/environmental policies should be mutually supportive and WTO consistent and contribute to the objectives of sustainable development. We also recognise the importance of inclusive international cooperation on digital trade. We recognize the need to promote value addition through sustainable and inclusive investment in highly productive sectors such as downstream manufacturing, digital trade, and services, and to foster linkages between foreign investors and local enterprises particularly MSMEs. We note the initiative from the Indonesian Presidency to hold discussions on policy coherence between trade, investment and industry, and to continue addressing industry-related issues in the broader G20 process, as appropriate.</p><p>38. We recognize the importance of revitalizing infrastructure investment in a sustainable, inclusive, accessible, and affordable way. We endorse the voluntary and non-binding G20/GI Hub Framework on How to Best Leverage Private Sector Participation to Scale Up Sustainable Infrastructure Investment which will consider country circumstances, and which will complement investment from other sources, including public investment and finance provided by MDBs. We note the Outcome Document from the 2022 G20 Infrastructure Investors Dialogue. To enhance social inclusion and address subnational disparities, we endorse the G20-OECD Policy Toolkit on Mobilizing Funding and Financing for Inclusive and Quality Infrastructure Investment in Regions and Cities, prepared with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We note the Preliminary Findings Report on Gender Inclusive Approaches in Private Participation in Infrastructure in promoting gender considerations during the infrastructure lifecycle and look forward to the final report. We endorse the InfraTracker 2.0 which will enable both the public and private sectors towards transformative infrastructure investment post-COVID-19, by providing insights into long-term infrastructure strategies and plans. To narrow the digital divide, we endorse the G20 Compendium of Case Studies on Digital Infrastructure Finance: Issues, Practices and Innovations. We endorse the Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII) Indicators and associated guidance note, developed for the G20, which are voluntary and non-binding and consider country circumstances, and we look forward to further discussions on how the QII indicators can be applied. We welcome progress made towards developing a possible new governance model for the Global Infrastructure Hub (GI Hub) and ask that principles to guide the process be finalized as soon as possible.</p><p>39. The rise of automation and digital technologies are reshaping the world of work, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Adding to the situation, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities in many countries and continues to disproportionately affect women, youth, older workers, persons with disabilities and migrant workers. We underline that it remains our utmost priority to mitigate the adverse impact of the current trends on the labour market, reduce inequalities while responding effectively to the opportunities that automation and digital technologies present and promote gender equality. We remain committed to the promotion of decent work and the elimination of child and forced labour.</p><p>40. We reaffirm our commitment to support the full inclusion of migrants, including migrant workers, refugees, in our recovery efforts, in the spirit of international cooperation and in line with national policies, legislation, and circumstances, ensuring full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms regardless of their migration status. We also recognize the importance of preventing irregular migration flows and the smuggling of migrants, as part of a comprehensive approach for safe, orderly and regular migration, while responding to humanitarian needs and the root causes of displacement. We support strengthening cooperation between countries of origin, transit, and destination. We will continue the dialogue on migration and forced displacement in future Presidencies.</p><p>41. We remain committed to a human-centred, inclusive, fair, sustainable approach that leads to greater social justice, decent work, and social protection for all. We will continue our work to integrate persons with disabilities, women, and youth across sectors and levels in pursuit of an inclusive labour market. We are resolved to promote sustainable development of human capacity, labour markets, and productivity, including through community-based vocational education and training, to advance job creation through entrepreneurship, to empower MSMEs, and to accelerate our efforts to foster and adapt labour protection for all workers, including those in the informal sector. We will maximize our approach to skills development to respond effectively to the needs of the labour market, with the involvement of social partners. We will accelerate progress towards the Antalya Youth Goal, as well as universal social protection for all by 2030.</p><p>42. We are deeply concerned that multidimensional crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lack of fiscal space and unequal access to finance and technology, are posing significant challenges towards realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in a timely manner. We will demonstrate leadership and take collective actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and accelerate the achievement of the SDGs by 2030 and address developmental challenges by reinvigorating a more inclusive multilateralism and reform aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>43. In this regard, we will strengthen inclusive and sustainable recovery and build resilience in all developing countries, including SIDS in the Pacific and Caribbean and LDCs, through ambitious and concrete actions. We also reiterate our continued support to Africa, including through the G20 Compact with Africa and the G20 Initiative on Supporting Industrialization in Africa and LDCs. We will focus on MSMEs, adaptive social protection, green economy and blue economy. We recognise the need for partnership to promote mutually beneficial technology cooperation and share good practice, as well as the need for inclusive and quality infrastructure investment for stronger recovery and resilience. We underscore the need to address the financing gap towards implementation of the 2030 Agenda, through enhancing innovative financing mechanisms, including blended finance, while noting the importance of transparency and mutual accountability. We take note of initiatives such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure and the Global Blended Finance Alliance, and welcome the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction. We look forward to the success of the SDGs Summit in 2023.</p><p>44. Access to education is a human right and a pivotal tool for inclusive and sustainable economic recovery. We welcome the outcome of the Transforming Education Summit. We will act in solidarity in particular with developing countries to rebuild more resilient, tech-enabled, accessible, and effective education systems. We will empower relevant actors within and beyond G20 to remove barriers to education, improve teaching and learning environments, and support transitions within and across all stages of education, with emphasis on women and girls. We also underscore the importance of learners' well-being in their preparation for work and meaningful participation and contribution to more equitable, inclusive and sustainable society. We reaffirm the importance of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and our commitment to SDG4 to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and training. We are committed to promoting lifelong learning at all levels amidst the changing nature of work and encourage partnership in this regard.</p><p>45. We acknowledge the importance of research and innovation in sustainable resource utilization in various sectors, especially in the midst of health, climate, food and energy crises. We welcome research and innovation collaboration for the conservation of biodiversity and its use to support the sustainable development including green and blue economy. We also promote inclusive collaborations to further research and innovation, as well as promoting researchers' international mobility.</p><p>46. As women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises, we reaffirm our commitment to put gender equality and women's empowerment at the core of our efforts for an inclusive recovery and sustainable development. We commit to implement the G20 Roadmap Towards and Beyond the Brisbane Goal foster financial inclusion and access to digital technologies, including to address the unequal distribution in paid and unpaid care and domestic work, with a focus on closing the gender pay gap. We commit to the elimination of gender-based violence, the enhancement of social, health, care and educational services, and the overcoming of gender stereotypes. We will continue to advance women's and girls' equal access to inclusive and quality education, including participations in STEM education, women entrepreneurship through MSMEs, and women's and girls' access in leadership positions. We will promote quality of life for women in rural areas and women with disabilities. We welcome the work that has been done by the EMPOWER Alliance and its engagement with the G20, and support the future convening of G20 Ministerial Conference on Women's Empowerment.</p><p>47. We reaffirm the important role of tourism for global recovery, and the community-based approach for rebuilding a more human-centred, inclusive, sustainable, and resilient tourism sector. We acknowledge the vital importance of strengthening safe international mobility and connectivity and seamless post-Covid travel to enable tourism recovery. We further recognize that creative economy, which involve knowledge-based economy, human creativity, and intellectual property rights, contributes to improving the resiliency of tourism local communities and MSMEs through human capital development, digital transformation, innovation, public-private partnerships, sustainable preservation of natural and cultural heritage, and innovative financing while retaining their significant commercial and cultural values.</p><p>48. We reaffirm the role of culture as an enabler and driver for sustainable development with intrinsic value beyond its social and economic benefits. We are committed to develop policies that draw on cultural diversity as a resource for sustainable living and promote an inclusive and equitable ecosystem at all levels that values the contribution of those working in the culture, arts and heritage sectors. We will respect, protect and preserve the cultural heritage of our peoples, including local communities and indigenous peoples, as applicable. We support public incentives and sustainable investments from the private sector to strengthen the cultural economy. We will safeguard cultural heritage as well as fighting illicit trafficking of cultural property and promoting restitution to its rightful owner/countries of origin, in accordance with the relevant UNESCO Conventions and national laws.</p><p>49. We will continue to lead by example through strengthening and implementing our obligations and commitments to anti-corruption efforts including through legally binding instruments, while renewing our commitment to zero tolerance for corruption. We emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability for both public and private sector as a crucial part of a collective recovery effort. We underscore the important role of auditing as well as public participation and anti-corruption education in preventing and tackling any form of corruption. We recall our commitments and call on all countries to criminalise bribery, including bribery of foreign public officials, and effectively prevent, combat, detect, investigate, prosecute and sanction bribery. We will further work to strengthen international cooperation and legal frameworks to combat economic crimes including corruption related to organized crime and money laundering, including, on a voluntary basis, through existing networks and initiatives such as GlobE and the G20 Denial of Entry Experts Network. We will share information on our actions towards criminalising foreign bribery and enforcing foreign bribery legislation in line with Article 16 of UNCAC, and look forward to enlarging participation to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, as appropriate. We reaffirm our commitment to deny safe haven to corruption offenders and their assets, in accordance to domestic laws. We also recognize the importance of mitigating corruption risk in all sectors. We will further strengthen our engagement with and promote active participation by stakeholders such as academia, civil society, media and the private sector, including to advance a culture of integrity.</p><p>50. We recognize the need for the international community to step up their efforts to effectively combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing. We reaffirm our commitment to delivering the strategic priorities of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its FATF Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) to lead global action to respond to these threats. We welcome the initiative by the FATF to promote implementation of international standards on virtual assets, in particular the \"travel rule\", and transparency of beneficial ownership, and acknowledge their role in the fight against systemic corruption and environmental crimes, which gravely impact economies and societies.

And I would like first to congratulate President Widodo for his wise leadership; the fact that we have arrived at an agreement on the statement at Sherpa level is an achievement in its own right. We are here to engage and to defend the multilateral world order, and we are here to help the G20 solve challenges for the benefit of us all.</p><p>This G20 takes place in a very different world from our meeting last year in Rome. Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a member of G20, is attacking the free and sovereign nation of Ukraine. Russia's war impacts us all no matter where we live, from Europe to Africa or the Middle East. And the single best way to end the acute crisis in food and energy is for Russia to end this senseless war and to respect the UN Charter.</p><p>We will also have the occasion to address the major challenge of food security. The number of people facing severe hunger and malnutrition is rising. The Kremlin has decided to weaponise food, driving up hunger, poverty and instability. It is also having dramatic global consequences on the developing world, including right here in Asia. And let me be clear, I repeat once again, EU sanctions adopted against Russia do not target agriculture and food products and they do not target the export of fertiliser from Russia.</p><p>On the other hand, Russia has imposed restrictions on the export of its own foodstuffs and, even before they launched the war, imposed restrictions on fertilisers. In the EU, we are working hard to address the global consequences of this war and this is why we are mobilising funds of euros8 billion to address food security, notably for the developing world. Before the war, Ukraine exported 45 million tonnes of agricultural goods to the world. We have managed to help Ukraine export 15 million tonnes via the EU solidarity lanes and an additional 10 million have been exported thanks to the Black Sea Grain Initiative. And it is important that this initiative of UN Secretary-General Guterres be continued. We must also address soaring fertiliser prices and disruption in fertiliser supplies, and I am looking forward to joining a dedicated side event on this topic tomorrow. I am still convinced that we can and we should support developing countries to produce their own sustainable fertilisers locally, like we did with COVID vaccines.</p><p>The energy crisis hurts families, increases costs for businesses and destabilises energy markets globally. As G20, we have the collective power, but also the collective responsibility, to help make sure the world has sustainable, secure and affordable energy for all. And in the EU, you know that we have in part based our transition strategy on reliable and affordable gas, and we need now to adapt that strategy. And we are grateful to those partners who have helped us to ensure urgent supplies, but prices need to be affordable and we need to implement concrete measures. In the EU, we are phasing out our dependence on Russian energy. We are diversifying our energy sources. We are speeding up renewables and bolstering our energy efficiency.</p><p>Climate neutrality by 2050 is and remains our guiding compass. The EU collectively remained the largest contributor to public climate funds of euros23 billion in 2021. As G20, we should work to steer a contribution to climate funds and we need to deliver on the 100 billion US dollar per year we have promised. It is time for the other developed partners to pay their fair share too. We are also supporting countries to decarbonise the industry. We are trying to help them to speed up their transition to green energy and technology. And our Just Energy Transition Partnership with South Africa, for instance, is a great example. We are ready for more partnerships like this.</p><p>Finally, one word on health. Two years ago, I proposed, together with Dr Tedros, a treaty on pandemics in order to learn the lessons from this COVID crisis. Negotiations on that treaty are now ongoing, and this is another concrete demonstration of great multilateralism anchored in solidarity, transparency and global coordination.</p><p>Let me conclude with a word of congratulations to President Joko Widodo. When we sat together just a few days ago in Cambodia, both of us shared the importance of this G20 being a success, and I sincerely hope it will be. Let's recover together. Let's recover stronger. Thank you.</p>", "publisher": "NEWS Press (English)", "instances": ["We urge for increased resource mobilization from all sources, including from countries and entities, to provide new and additional financial resources for the implementation of the GBF, once it is negotiated, including to help enable and support developing country parties, and for aligning private and public financial flows with biodiversity objectives.

We recognize the effort made by a number of countries to ensure that at least 30% of global land and at least 30% of the global ocean and seas are conserved or protected by 2030 and we will help to make progress towards this objective in accordance with national circumstances. We commit to reduce environmental impacts by changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns as well as to enhance environmentally sound waste management including by preventing illegal cross-border traffic of waste. 15. We will step up efforts to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, including through Nature-based Solutions and Ecosystem-based Approaches, support climate mitigation and adaptation, enhance environmental conservation and protection, sustainable use and restoration, responding to natural disasters, reduce ecosystem degradation, enhance ecosystem services and to address issues affecting the marine and coastal environment. We will further promote sustainable development and lifestyles, resource efficiency and circular economy to increase sustainability and work together on scientific knowledge-sharing, raising awareness, and capacity building, particularly to advance on the ocean-based climate action.

Earlier in the year, France's Total, which owns a battery maker, agreed to make several large investments in solar power in Spain and a wind farm off Scotland. Total also bought an electric and natural gas utility in Spain and is joining Shell and BP in expanding its electric vehicle charging business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, the companies are ditching plans to drill more wells as they chop back capital budgets.

Mr. Looney said this month that he planned to increase investment in low-emission businesses like renewable energy by tenfold in the next decade to $5 billion a year, while cutting back oil and gas production by 40 percent. By 2030, BP aims to generate renewable electricity comparable to a few dozen large offshore wind farms.</p><p>Mr. Looney, though, has said oil and gas production need to be retained to generate cash to finance the company's future.</p><p>Environmentalists and analysts described Mr. Looney's statement that BP's oil and gas production would decline in the future as a breakthrough that would put pressure on other companies to follow.</p><p>BP's move \"clearly differentiates them from peers,\" said Andrew Grant, an analyst at Carbon Tracker, a London nonprofit. He noted that most other oil companies had so far been unwilling to confront \"the prospect of producing less fossil fuels.\"</p><p>While there is skepticism in both the environmental and the investment communities about whether century-old companies like BP and Shell can learn new tricks, they do bring scale and know-how to the task.</p><p>\"To make a switch from a global economy that depends on fossil fuels for 80 percent of its energy to something else is a very, very big job,\" said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian who has a forthcoming book, \"The New Map,\" on the transition now occurring in energy.

European electric companies are perceived as having done more than the oil industry to embrace the new energy era.</p><p>\"It is very tricky for an investor to have confidence that they can pull this off,\" Mr. Clint said, referring to the oil industry's aspirations to change.</p><p>But, he said, he expects funds to flow back into oil stocks as the new businesses gather momentum.</p><p>At times, supplying electricity has been less profitable than drilling for oil and gas. Executives, though, figure that wind farms and solar parks are likely to produce more predictable revenue, partly because customers want to buy products labeled green.</p><p>Mr. Descalzi of Eni said converted refineries in Venice and Sicily that the company uses to make lower-carbon fuel from plant matter have produced better financial results in this difficult year than its traditional businesses.</p><p>Oil companies insist that they must continue with some oil and gas investments, not least because those earnings can finance future energy sources. \"Not to make any mistake,\" Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, chief executive of Total, said to analysts recently: Low-cost oil projects will be a part of the future.</p><p>During the pandemic, BP, Total and Shell have all scrutinized their portfolios, partly to determine if climate change pressures and lingering effects from the pandemic mean that petroleum reserves on their books - developed for perhaps billions of dollars, when oil was at the center of their business - might never be produced or earn less than previously expected. These exercises have led to tens of billions of dollars of write-offs for the second quarter, and there are likely to be more as companies recalibrate their plans.</p><p>\"We haven't seen the last of these,\" said Luke Parker, vice president for corporate analysis at Wood Mackenzie, a market research firm. \"There will be more to come as the realities of the energy transition bite.\"</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["We are seeing a much bigger differentiation in corporate strategy\" separating American and European oil companies \"than at any point in my career,\" said Jason Gammel, a veteran oil analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank.

It shows how we\u00a0will navigate the transition profitably and in\u00a0line with our purpose - to power progress together with more and\u00a0cleaner\u00a0energy solutions.</p><p>We have prepared this Energy Transition Strategy publication for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting of Royal Dutch Shell, on May 18, 2021. It follows detailed conversations with shareholders and describes Shell's energy transition strategy, including our emissions targets.</p><p>Your Directors recognise their responsibility to set the company's strategy. This is unchanged. We consider this publication, and the strategy it summarises, to be aligned with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the increase in the average global temperature to\u00a01.5\u00a0degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>Shell is the first energy company to submit its energy transition strategy to\u00a0shareholders for an advisory vote. We will publish an update every three years until 2050. Every year, starting in 2022, we will also seek an\u00a0advisory vote on our progress towards our plans and targets.</p><p>The vote is purely advisory and will not be binding on shareholders. We\u00a0are not asking shareholders to take responsibility for formally approving or\u00a0objecting to Shell's energy transition strategy. That legal\u00a0responsibility lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>While the energy transition brings risks to the company, it also brings opportunities for us to prosper and to build on our positive contribution to\u00a0society. Our strategy, as outlined in this report, is designed to minimise those risks while enhancing our ability to profitably lead as the world transitions to an energy system that is aligned with the goal of the Paris\u00a0Agreement.</p><p>It is important for shareholders to have a clear understanding of the company's strategy as we work together to meet the goal of Paris. The Board and management also believe it is important for all shareholders to\u00a0have a vehicle to express their views on whether our strategy is reasonable in the current environment. This advisory vote is designed to\u00a0be that vehicle. It does not shield or abdicate the Board's or management's legal obligations under the UK Companies Act.</p><p>The support of our shareholders is critical for us to achieve our target to\u00a0become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We hope to gain your support for the approach described in this publication. In addition to\u00a0your vote, we invite your continued feedback ahead of the publication of our next Energy Transition Strategy which will\u00a0be presented to shareholders before the Annual General Meeting in\u00a02024.</p><p>The Board recommends that you vote in favour of resolution 20, in support\u00a0of the energy transition strategy described in this publication.</p><p>CHAD HOLLIDAYChair</p><p>CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S INTRODUCTIONTackling climate change is the biggest challenge the world faces today. Our Powering Progress strategy, which we launched in February 2021, sets out how Shell can and must play a leading role in helping society to meet that challenge.</p><p>As we transform our business, it is more important than ever for our shareholders to understand and support our approach. That is why we are\u00a0publishing details of our energy transition strategy and, for the first time, submitting it to shareholders for an advisory vote at our Annual General Meeting this year.</p><p>Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in\u00a0step with society's progress towards the goal of the Paris Agreement on\u00a0climate change, is at the heart of our energy transition strategy. That\u00a0means continuing to reduce our total absolute emissions to net\u00a0zero\u00a0by 2050.</p><p>We have set our net-zero target, and our short- and medium-term carbon intensity targets, so that they are fully consistent with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. And our targets cover the full range of our emissions, Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of all the energy we sell, not just the energy we produce.</p><p>We are asking our shareholders to vote for an energy transition strategy that is designed to bring our energy products, our services, and our investments in line with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and the global drive to combat climate change. It is a strategy that we believe creates value for our shareholders, our customers and wider society.</p><p>WORKING WITH OUR CUSTOMERSMost of our emissions come from the use of our fuels and the other energy products we sell. So it makes sense to place our customers at the centre of our energy transition strategy. It is where we can make the biggest difference. We will work with our customers to change and grow demand for low-carbon energy products and services, sector by sector, using the strength of our business relationships, knowledge and expertise.</p><p>We will increasingly offer low-carbon products and solutions, such as biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, hydrogen and renewable power, as well as carbon capture and storage and nature-based offsets. In this way, we expect to build low-carbon businesses of significant scale over the coming decade. In addition, we will drive down emissions from our own operations as we continue to provide the oil and gas products our customers need today, while at the same time helping them move to\u00a0a\u00a0low- and zero-carbon future.</p><p>To be clear, the best way for Shell to contribute to the energy transition is to work with our customers to help shape demand for low-carbon energy products and services. In turn, the increasing need to supply low-carbon energy products and services will accelerate Shell's transition to net zero. Ending our activities in oil and gas too early when they are vital to meeting\u00a0today's energy demand would not help our customers, or our\u00a0shareholders.</p><p>SEEKING SHAREHOLDER SUPPORTThe decision to seek an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy follows our continuing engagement with shareholders, including with Climate Action 100+, which represents investors with assets of around $54 trillion. This vote does not replace the responsibilities of our Directors in setting the company's strategy. We have based the structure of this publication around the net-zero disclosure standard developed by Climate\u00a0Action 100+ for the oil and gas industry.</p><p>In the following pages we set out our short-, medium- and long-term targets, our decarbonisation strategy and how we intend to allocate capital across our three business pillars of Growth, Transition and Upstream in the years ahead. We also explain our approach to climate-related policy and advocacy, an important part of how we are working with governments and others to accelerate the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy.</p><p>As the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19, companies also play an important role in powering lives. In this publication, we describe how we will support livelihoods and communities\u00a0as we transform our business.</p><p>We also outline our strong governance and a commitment to transparency. As we continue to implement the recommendations of\u00a0the\u00a0Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we show how\u00a0we\u00a0are managing the risks and opportunities of climate change.</p><p>I would like to thank the investor groups we have worked with as we have\u00a0developed our energy transition strategy, including the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Climate Action 100+. We must continue our dialogue with investors as Shell continues to evolve. We will be transparent so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress to that of other companies.</p><p>This is a critical time in the world's efforts to tackle climate change. It\u00a0is\u00a0also a time of tremendous opportunity for Shell. By transforming our\u00a0business in line with our energy transition strategy, we will contribute to achieving a net-zero emissions energy system, help society reach its\u00a0climate goals and create a compelling investment case for our shareholders, today and in the future. We ask our shareholders to vote for resolution 20 and support the execution of our energy transition strategy.</p><p>BEN VAN BEURDENCEO</p><p>SHELL'S PATH TO NET-ZERO EMISSIONSThis is the first time that Shell has offered investors an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy. This vote represents\u00a0the next step in our continuing dialogue with our investors. It is also one of many firsts on our path to\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business.</p><p>2021</p><p>Launched Powering Progress strategy to accelerate the transition of our business to net-zero emissions, including targets to reduce\u00a0the\u00a0carbon intensity of energy products we sell: by 6-8% by 2023, 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035 and 100% by 2050.Published the 2021 Industry Associations Climate Review, extending our coverage to 36 industry associations.Offered advisory vote on Shell's energy transition strategy. Increasing the weighting of the Energy Transition performance metric in the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) from 10% to 20%.Introduced an absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement target to the annual bonus scorecard, and the total weighting of\u00a0measures\u00a0connected to GHG emissions is increasing from 10% to 15%.</p><p>2020</p><p>Announced target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress as it works towards the\u00a0Paris\u00a0Agreement goal of limiting the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C.Published the Industry Associations Climate Review Update, including Shell's updated climate-related policy positions and our\u00a0payments\u00a0to key industry associations.Energy Transition performance metric extended to around 16,500 employees through the performance share plan (PSP).</p><p>2019</p><p>Published the first Industry Associations Climate Review, which reviewed the alignment between our climate-related policy positions and\u00a0those of 19 key industry associations of which we are a member. Announced a programme to invest in natural ecosystems as part of our strategy to act on global climate change, including addressing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated by customers when using our products. This programme contributes to Shell's three-year target, beginning in 2019, to reduce our Net Carbon Footprint by 2-3% by 2021.Introduced the Energy Transition performance metric into the LTIP. The LTIP includes short-term targets linked to\u00a0our Net Carbon Footprint target, as well as a number of other strategic business transformation targets that measure progress towards\u00a0achieving our longer-term ambitions.

It requires a fundamental transformation of the global economy, and the energy system, so that society stops adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, achieving what is\u00a0known as net-zero emissions.</p><p>That is why Shell has set a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress in achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change. We believe our target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the\u00a0average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>It is aligned with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which concluded that the world must reach net-zero carbon emissions by around 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and\u00a0avoid the\u00a0worst effects of climate change.</p><p>Becoming a net-zero emissions energy business means that we are reducing emissions from our operations, and from the fuels and other energy products such as electricity that we sell to our customers. It also means capturing and storing any remaining emissions using technology or\u00a0balancing them with offsets.</p><p>COLLABORATIONIncreasing numbers of countries and companies have announced targets to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century, and we are starting to see some changes in the demand and supply of energy.</p><p>Achieving the 1.5\u00b0C goal will be challenging but it is technically possible. The extent of global collaboration required will be unprecedented. The pace of change will also be different around the world. The wealthier, more developed countries and regions must move faster. If they do not, then those countries and regions that cannot move so quickly will not have\u00a0the time they need. The European Union (EU), for example, must achieve net-zero emissions by no later than 2050 if the world is to succeed\u00a0in\u00a0limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>Shell has built a scenario looking at what the EU might need to do to decarbonise which gives some insight into the scale of the significant challenge involved. The scenario identified nine areas for action.</p><p>THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGEAs an illustration, achieving net-zero emissions in the EU in the next 30 years could mean:</p><p>ACCELERATING CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>Double the generation of electricity, triple its share of final energyShift the electricity mix to 75% renewables, no coalTarget 10% hydrogen in final energy, including as a fuel for heating, industry and heavy transportTriple the use of biofuels, with a shift to advanced forms</p><p>TARGETING BEHAVIOURAL INCENTIVES</p><p>Invest in infrastructure to improve energy efficiency per unit of GDP by almost 45%Incentivise green consumer and business choices in support of the green economyProgressively raise the government-led carbon price in the EU to more than (EURO)200/tonne of CO2equivalent in 2050</p><p>REMOVING EMISSIONS</p><p>Build at least two major carbon capture and utilisation facilities every month (more than 1 million tonnes each)Reforest at least 220,000 square kilometres in the EU (about half the area of Spain) to remove the remaining 300 million tonnes of CO2in 2050</p><p>Source: Shell Scenarios Sketch: A climate-neutral EU by 2050</p><p>Achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement will require simultaneous growth in supply and demand for low-carbon energy. Crucially, it will also\u00a0require significant changes to the way our customers use energy, whether they are motorists, households or businesses.</p><p>All parts of society including energy producers, consumers and policymakers will need to take action. That is why our strategy is based on working with our customers and others to accelerate the transition of the energy system. This includes supporting government policies that\u00a0will help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>We will build on our strengths, our global scale and deep knowledge of energy markets to help grow demand for low-carbon energy. In this way, we will continue to build a strong business while playing an important role in the transition to low-carbon energy.</p><p>NET ZERO FROM OUR OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTSOur net-zero target includes emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and the life-cycle emissions, including from the end use, from all the energy products we sell, our Scope 3 emissions.</p><p>We will reduce emissions from our own operations, including the production of oil and gas, by increasing energy efficiency and capturing or offsetting any remaining emissions.</p><p>More than 90% of our emissions come from the use of the fuels and other\u00a0energy products we sell, so we must also work with our customers to\u00a0reduce their emissions when that energy is used [B]. That means offering them the low-carbon products and services they need such as\u00a0renewable electricity, biofuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage\u00a0and nature-based offsets.</p><p>Importantly, our target includes emissions not only from the energy we produce and process ourselves, including oil and gas, but also from all the\u00a0energy products that other companies produce and we sell [C]. This\u00a0is\u00a0significant because we sell more than three times the energy we\u00a0produce ourselves.</p><p>In summary, our targets include all emissions from the energy we sell, and the majority of the emissions we include in our targets are not related to our own oil and gas production.</p><p>[B] This includes emissions from the use of energy produced and sold by Shell as well as full life-cycle emissions from energy produced by others and sold by Shell. Combined, these are\u00a0reported under relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2020/\">https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2020/</url>).</emphasis>[C] Sales from retail stations that use the Shell brand but are not operated or supplied by Shell are excluded.</p><p>WE ADDRESS THE EMISSIONS FROM ALL THE ENERGY WE SELL</p><p>OUR TARGETS: SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG TERMWe believe our total absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes and our climate target means we will have to bring that down to absolute net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>As we work to achieve that target, and to measure our progress over the\u00a0next three decades, we have set short-, medium- and long-term targets to\u00a0reduce the carbon intensity [D] of the energy products we sell. Carbon intensity is the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with\u00a0each unit of energy that we sell, and that is used by our customers.</p><p>We use carbon intensity targets to measure our progress because we think they are the clearest way to demonstrate changes to our mix of energy products over time, as we add and then shift to low-carbon energy products and services.</p><p>We have set specific carbon intensity reduction targets for the following years. These targets are compared with 2016 and linked to the\u00a0remuneration of around 16,500 Shell employees:</p><p>2-3% by 2021 3-4% by 2022 6-8% by 2023</p><p>We also have medium- and long-term carbon intensity targets, in step with society:</p><p>20% by 2030 45% by 2035*100% by 2050*</p><p>REDUCING THE CARBON INTENSITY OF ALL ENERGY SOLDgCO2e/MJ</p><p>2016 baseline2023: -6-8% (Carbon intensity incl. mitigation by Shell (Net Carbon Footprint))2030: -20% (Carbon intensity incl. mitigation by Shell (Net Carbon Footprint))2035: -45% (Carbon intensity incl. all mitigation actions (Shell &amp; customers))2050: -100% (Carbon intensity incl. all mitigation actions (Shell &amp; customers))</p><p>We measure our carbon intensity with our Net Carbon Footprint methodology [E] which calculates the carbon intensity of the portfolio of\u00a0energy products sold by Shell expressed as grams of CO2equivalent (gCO2e) per megajoule (MJ) of energy delivered to, and consumed by, our customers.</p><p>*\u00a0\u00a0 These targets include mitigation actions by our customers such as carbon capture and storage and nature-based offsets.[D]Carbon intensity as used in this report refers to net carbon intensity, which includes offsets and is measured by our Net Carbon Footprint methodology.[E] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/ncfmethodologyPetrochemicals\">https://www.shell.com/ncfmethodologyPetrochemicals</url> and other products such as lubricants are not included in our short- and medium-term targets because they are not burnt and do not produce Scope 3 emissions. Their production and processing produce emissions, and we include these within our target to achieve net-zero emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from our operations by 2050.</p><p>ALIGNING OUR TARGETS WITH PARISShell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce our carbon intensity, measured by our Net Carbon Footprint methodology. We believe these targets are aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios used in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR 1.5), most of which show the global energy system reaching net zero between 2040 and 2060.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets with the temperature limit goal of the Paris Agreement. In the absence of a broadly accepted standard, we developed our own approach to demonstrate Paris alignment by setting carbon intensity targets using a pathway derived from the IPCC\u00a0scenarios aligned with the Paris goal.</p><p>We determined our targets using scenarios taken from a database developed for the IPCC SR 1.5 [F]. We filtered out certain outlying IPCC scenarios to ensure that Shell's targets are aligned with earlier action, and low-overshoot scenarios. Overshoot refers to the extent to which a scenario exceeds an emissions budget and subsequently relies on sinks to compensate for the excess emissions.</p><p>We then take the following steps:</p><p>1. The total energy in each of the scenarios is calculated at the point of delivered energy (energy that is processed by refining or liquefaction, for example, but before it is used for electricity generation) using a fossil fuel equivalence approach for electricity. This more accurately reflects the energy delivered by an energy supplier like Shell to the market.</p><p>2. The total net emissions of each scenario are calculated taking into account emissions stored using carbon capture and storage and offset using natural sinks.</p><p>3. The carbon intensity for each scenario is calculated by dividing the net emissions by the total delivered energy. The range of carbon intensities of the scenarios allows for the construction of a benchmark range after removing any outliers.</p><p>By using the benchmark range produced by this approach to set our targets, we aligned them with the necessary reduction in carbon intensity shown in the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. This is illustrated in the graphic on the right that demonstrates how Shell's targets are positioned within the range of 1.5\u00b0C pathways. The upper and lower lines represent the upper and lower boundaries of the benchmark range derived from the IPCC scenarios.</p><p>Until 2035, our calculation of the total net emissions of each scenario includes only the expected mitigation actions by Shell such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting using natural sinks, including any use of offsets included in the carbon-neutral energy products we offer our customers. After that date, we also include mitigation actions taken separately by our customers.</p><p>Today, we do not include any mitigation steps taken separately by our\u00a0customers. That is because the accounting standards to include those actions do not exist. Under existing protocols, energy suppliers report the Scope 3 emissions from the use of their products, which are\u00a0equivalent to the Scope 1 emissions reported by the users of those\u00a0products.</p><p>However, when users of energy mitigate their Scope 1 emissions by use\u00a0of carbon capture and storage or offsets, there is no accounting protocol for reflecting the corresponding reduction in the Scope 3 emissions reporting by the energy supplier.</p><p>To account for reductions in emissions across full energy value chains it is necessary to build on the existing greenhouse gas reporting and accounting protocols to include mitigation actions by both energy suppliers and users. Shell is in discussions with standard-setting bodies such as Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the World Resources Institute and CDP to develop the accounting protocols and frameworks to include mitigation actions by energy suppliers and energy users.</p><p>Reporting and accounting for mitigations in this way will also need new\u00a0systems for the exchange of data between suppliers and users of\u00a0energy. We expect these developments will take three to five years. Our carbon intensity targets for 2035 and 2050 reflect this expected change in accounting approach.</p><p>[F] These scenarios do not include Shell's Sky 1.5 scenario.</p><p>SHELL'S CARBON INTENSITY TARGETSgCO2e/MJ</p><p>OUR APPROACHWe have set our targets to be in line with climate science and in step with society's progress as it works towards the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>This progress will depend on whether governments and businesses, including Shell, provide the right conditions and incentives for low- and zero-carbon choices, and on whether consumers embrace these changes.</p><p>We must work towards our long-term target of net-zero emissions immediately. That is why we have set a series of short-term targets that are\u00a0reflected in the remuneration of 16,500 employees. These short-term targets are not conditional on whether society progresses towards the goal of net-zero emissions; and while extremely challenging, they are aligned with our current operating plans.</p><p>If we moved too far ahead of society, it is likely that we would be making products that our customers are unable or unwilling to buy. That is why we\u00a0wish to work together with customers, governments and across sectors to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions. Shell cannot get to net zero without society also being net zero.</p><p>For example, if we invested in producing sustainable aviation fuel, and made it available on commercial terms at all the airports Shell serves today, the investment would not significantly lower our or society's carbon\u00a0emissions. Most aircraft are not yet certified to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuel and the cost of the fuel is considerably more than\u00a0traditional jet fuel, making it an uncompetitive choice for the airlines.</p><p>Our strategy instead is to work with partners - including aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, major airline users and governments -\u00a0to\u00a0stimulate and accelerate demand for sustainable aviation fuel. As\u00a0demand grows, we will increase our investments.</p><p>WORKING TO MEET OUR TARGETSThe transport sector is a good illustration of how the energy transition is likely to unfold. As in other sectors, the reductions in carbon intensity will be slow at first, reflecting the challenge of switching today's forms of transport to new technologies. The IPCC Special Report shows that the energy intensity of fuels in the transport sector has fallen only slightly in the past 10 years, through the blending of biofuels with traditional fuels, the increased use of liquefied natural gas as a transport fuel, and the growth in electric vehicles. But as the cost of low-carbon vehicles comes down, for\u00a0example, they will replace vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. The IPCC scenarios show the tipping point to be somewhere between now and 2030, leading to net-zero transport after 2050.</p><p>Shell will reduce the carbon intensity of our energy products by working with our customers, sector by sector, to help them navigate the energy transition. As we do so, we intend to build even deeper relationships with\u00a0our customers and meet more of their energy needs. We will start by\u00a0adding more low-carbon products, such as biofuels and electricity, to the\u00a0mix of energy products we sell. Eventually, low-carbon products will replace the higher carbon products that we sell today. This transformation of our business will require a fundamental change to energy-related infrastructure and assets across economies (see box Structural change on\u00a0page 14).</p><p>We are working with partners - including aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, major\u00a0airline users and governments - to stimulate and accelerate demand for sustainable aviation fuel. As demand grows, we will increase our investments.</p><p>For example, in the road freight sector, we are working with transport companies, truck manufacturers and policymakers to identify pathways to decarbonisation. In the near term, we will continue to increase production of low-carbon biofuels. And we will offer biogas and LNG for trucks to customers in Europe, China and the USA. In the longer term, we intend to increase our sales of hydrogen for transport. We are also part of the H2Accelerate consortium, which looks at ways to create infrastructure for generating and supplying clean hydrogen to hydrogen trucks as they become available across Europe.</p><p>CARBON INTENSITY RANGE FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE IPCC 1.5\u00b0C SCENARIOSgCO2e/MJ</p><p>OUR PLANSShell's operating plans, outlooks and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and how we can reasonably expect our business to develop over the next 10 years. Our short-term targets are aligned with our current operating plans.</p><p>However, our operating plans do not yet reflect our long-term 2050 net-zero emissions target, as it is not feasible to make a 30-year detailed operating plan. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions to reflect this movement and continue to be in step with society. This movement will also be reflected over time in our energy transition strategy that we are offering for an advisory vote.</p><p>OUR SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCEShell's carbon intensity in 2020 was 75 gCO2e/MJ, a 4% reduction from the previous year and a 5% reduction from the 2016 reference year. In 2020, one of the major causes of this reduction was lower demand for energy. Demand for oil products experienced the most significant reduction, followed by natural gas and LNG. Another important factor contributing to the reduction of our carbon intensity was the increase in our power sales in absolute terms as well as in their share of the energy mix sold by Shell. The power we sold also had a lower average emissions intensity than in previous years, which further contributed to the overall reduction.</p><p>OUR DECARBONISATION STRATEGYAs a leading energy company, we serve the transport, industry, built environment and power generation sectors. Each has different needs. Some sectors are global while others are highly centralised and local. Some have assets that are designed to last more than 50 years, others less than 10 years. Our deep understanding of these sectors and our customers, and of the opportunities and challenges they face, will help us transform demand for our products.</p><p>Transforming energy demand is the focus of our decarbonisation strategy. To transform demand, we will work sector by sector across the energy system. We will change the mix of energy products we sell to our customers as their needs for energy change.</p><p>This is where we can make the greatest contribution to the energy transition, by increasing sales of low-carbon energy products and services. Today, we sell around 4.6% of final energy consumed in the\u00a0world and produce around 1.4% of total primary energy. Our share of\u00a0energy production may decline over the coming decades, but we intend to grow\u00a0our share of low-carbon energy sales.</p><p>We are restructuring our company so that we can better identify opportunities and the role that we can play in each sector to help transform demand. We are moving from an approach focused on\u00a0types\u00a0of\u00a0products to one where our customer and account management\u00a0is\u00a0focused on sectors.</p><p>We are introducing sector-based businesses accountable for driving the decarbonisation of the sectors they cover such as aviation, commercial road transport, passenger transport, shipping, technology and industry. We will build on our existing relationships across each sector, with consumers, infrastructure owners, other suppliers and policymakers to help to accelerate change.</p><p>TRANSFORMATION OF THE ENERGY SYSTEMThe transformation of the energy system to net-zero emissions will require simultaneous action in three areas - an unprecedented improvement in the efficiency with which energy is used, a sharp reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix and the mitigation of\u00a0residual emissions using technology and natural sinks. While it is difficult to predict the exact combination of actions that will deliver the\u00a0net-zero goal, scenarios help us to understand the direction and pace of the transition needed.</p><p>The diagrams on the next page use data from the International Energy Agency's Sustainable Development Scenario (IEA ETP 2020). They\u00a0show how the energy mix and carbon dioxide emissions could\u00a0change between 2019 and 2050.</p><p>A fundamental shift is needed in the way energy is used and produced. For example, it will require a deep electrification of most energy end-uses and decarbonisation of that electricity. By 2050, most of the residual emissions come from energy use, while in comparison energy supply is far more decarbonised. Low- and zero-carbon energy, including hydrogen and biofuels as well as CCUS, will be needed to\u00a0mitigate most emissions in hard-to-abate sectors, such as parts of\u00a0transport and industry.</p><p>While the Sustainable Development Scenario is a well-below 2\u00b0C scenario reaching net-zero emissions by 2070, it helps to show the\u00a0scale of the transformation of the energy system needed. The\u00a0IEA's Faster Innovation Case, which builds on the Sustainable Development Scenario, demonstrates how the transformation can\u00a0be accelerated to\u00a0achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. For example, compared to the\u00a0Sustainable Development Scenario, it would need a 55% increase in hydrogen use, 25% more energy from electricity and 20% more bio-energy use. The use of CCUS will also need to be 50% higher, reaching 8 gigatonnes a year by 2050.</p><p>GLOBAL ENERGY EMISSIONS: 2019-2050</p><p>STRUCTURAL CHANGEAs well as changes to the supply of energy products, decarbonising the energy system requires structural change in the end use of energy as well. It requires energy users to improve, update or replace equipment so that they can use carbon-based energy more efficiently, or switch to low- and zero-carbon energy. For example, in\u00a0the transport sector, decarbonisation includes replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with electric and hydrogen vehicles.</p><p>In industry, replacing oil- and coal-fired furnaces with electrical furnaces would be one solution, carbon capture and storage is another. And in buildings, replacing gas heating systems with electric heating systems would also contribute to decarbonisation.</p><p>Such structural changes will help to trigger transitions along the supply chain of individual sectors and across sectors, including the production of energy and emissions over time. The International Energy Agency suggests that these changes in the end use of energy will require substantial investment. Of the more than $1.5\u00a0trillion extra annual spending on energy-sector investment which is required under the IEA's Paris-aligned Sustainable Development Scenario, 55% will need to be spent on end use or\u00a0what is more commonly known as demand-side investment.</p><p>RENEWABLE POWEROur sector-based business model reinforces the place of customers at the heart of our strategy. It allows us to work together to identify opportunities for immediate carbon reductions, including low-carbon fuels, as well as for longer-term solutions that will help customers get to net zero. For example, in the Netherlands we have entered into an agreement to provide renewable power to Amazon from an offshore wind farm being constructed off the coast of the Netherlands, enabling Amazon to\u00a0power\u00a0more of its business with clean energy.</p><p>The guaranteed demand from Amazon helps us to invest further in the production of green hydrogen and CCS through the creation of a green energy hub in the port of Rotterdam. Shell aims to produce green hydrogen there using electricity generated by wind power, hydrogen that will be used at the Shell refinery in Pernis to decarbonise the production of fuels.</p><p>Through its air cargo fleet, Amazon also has a growing interest in aviation. Shell has one of the world's most extensive aircraft refuelling networks. We have agreed to supply Amazon with up to six million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel for its cargo aircraft. This biofuel, produced by the company World Energy using agricultural waste fats and\u00a0oils, has lower life-cycle carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel. In December 2020, Shell and Amazon also announced minority investments in ZeroAvia, a company in the USA with ambitions to decarbonise aviation with hydrogen-powered planes.</p><p>OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COMPANIESSTRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH MICROSOFTWe have formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft which includes us working together on digital technologies that help Shell and our customers manage and reduce our carbon footprints. Shell is also supplying Microsoft with low-carbon energy products and services, including renewable energy.</p><p>ROLLS-ROYCERolls-Royce and Shell have collaborated for more than 100 years, pioneering technology, fuels and infrastructure that have shaped commercial aviation. Today, Shell and Rolls-Royce are working together to test Rolls-Royce engines to show they can run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel.</p><p>CLEAN SKIES FOR TOMORROWIn the aviation sector, Shell is a founding partner of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, an initiative with the Mission Possible Platform. This platform was launched by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century from a group of traditionally hard-to-abate industry sectors.</p><p>The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition consists of airlines, airports, fuel providers and engine manufacturers. It is working to reduce emissions from the aviation sector by making sustainable aviation fuel more widely used and available. The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition has jointly developed and published policy proposals which it has put to the European Union to promote debate on how to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality and increase the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels [G].</p><p>[G]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/joint-policy-proposal-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-sustainable-aviation-fuels-in-europe-a-clean-skies-for-tomorrow-publication\">https://www.weforum.org/reports/joint-policy-proposal-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-sustainable-aviation-fuels-in-europe-a-clean-skies-for-tomorrow-publication</url></p><p>SHARING INSIGHTS INTO THE TRANSITIONOur strategy includes participating in coalitions of companies and organisations to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions. We will help to develop paths to low-carbon energy in different sectors, identify opportunities for low-carbon solutions, and advocate government policies and financial market regulations that support the transition.</p><p>In the shipping and road freight sectors, for example, we have partnered with Deloitte to explore paths to reducing emissions [H].</p><p>[H]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-shipping.html;\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-shipping.html;</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-road-freight.html\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-road-freight.html</url></p><p>SIX LEVERS TO HELP DECARBONISE ENERGYAs Shell works with our customers to identify the best paths to decarbonisation, we seek to avoid, reduce and only then mitigateany remaining emissions.</p><p>We have six levers to help Shell and our customers decarbonise energy in\u00a0the short, medium and long term:</p><p>Pursuing operational efficiency in our assets;Shifting to natural gas;Growing our low-carbon power business;Providing low-carbon fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen;Developing carbon capture and storage; andUsing natural sinks.</p><p>ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN OUR OPERATIONSOur production sites are increasingly using lower-carbon energy sources. For example, we are installing eight new cracker furnaces at our Moerdijk petrochemicals complex in the Netherlands, replacing 16 older units. This is expected to reduce the site's energy\u00a0consumption, and to lower greenhouse gas emissions by\u00a0around 10% compared with 2019.</p><p>In the USA, we are building a 250 MW co-generation plant at our Pennsylvania chemicals facility that will also supply electricity\u00a0to local homes. The chemicals plant has been designed\u00a0with an energy-efficient gas cracker that will also use hydrogen as a fuel source.</p><p>As we implement our strategy, we are aiming for milestones which are\u00a0supported by our business plans and planned capital investment.</p><p>EXAMPLES OF ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES BY 2030</p><p>Milestones for 2030 unless otherwise stated. This chart is illustrative of the potential impact across these levers.</p><p>1\u00a0\u00a0 For assets we operate EV charge points include charge points at Shell forecourts and new locations as well as operated charge points owned by customers and third parties.</p><p>INVESTING IN NATUREThe protection and restoration of natural ecosystems could play an important role in limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C, while bringing additional environmental and social benefits, according to the IPCC [I].</p><p>Nature-based solutions, or natural climate solutions, are projects that protect, transform or restore land. In this way, CO2emissions from the natural environment are reduced and more CO2emissions from the atmosphere are absorbed. These projects can lead to the marketing, trading and sale of carbon credits. Each carbon credit represents the avoidance or removal of 1 tonne of CO2.</p><p>The market for nature-based solutions and the number and type of projects which are being developed to meet this market demand is growing rapidly. McKinsey Nature Analytics estimates that there is the potential for nature-based projects to store an additional 6.7 gigatonnes of CO2every year by 2030. Based on current net-zero commitments from more than 700 of the world's largest companies, there have already been commitments of carbon credits of around 0.2 gigatonnes of CO2by 2030 [J].</p><p>The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM), sponsored by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), estimates that the market for carbon credits could be worth more than $50\u00a0billion in 2030 [K].</p><p>[I] IPCC, 2019: Summary for Policymakers.

In line with our approach of avoid, reduce and only then mitigate, we expect to offer our customers nature-based solutions to offset around 120 million tonnes per annum of our Scope 3 emissions by 2030.</p><p>Today, for example, we offer customers carbon-neutral driving using\u00a0nature-based carbon offsets in seven countries. We also offer\u00a0carbon-neutral liquefied natural gas cargoes, which use nature-based carbon credits to offset full life-cycle emissions, including methane.</p><p>BUILDING OUR PORTFOLIOIn 2020, we invested around $90 million in the future development and purchase of nature-based offsets, and we expect to invest around $100 million a year.</p><p>In 2020, we acquired Select Carbon in Australia, which runs more\u00a0than 70 carbon farming projects that span an area of around 10\u00a0million hectares. We are also working with project developers to\u00a0invest in and develop new projects based on reforestation, agroforestry and mangroves.</p><p>In 2030, we expect our own portfolio of nature-based projects to supply most of the credits for our customers. Our trading business will purchase the rest from project developers that we screen to ensure the credits meet the same independently verified high standards. In\u00a02020, we purchased more than 4 million tonnes of credits on behalf of our customers sourced from projects around the world.</p><p>CAPTURING CARBONMost climate scientists are clear that using technology to store carbon plays an important role in the transition of the energy system. The IPCC 1.5\u00b0C scenarios show that even when the energy system reaches net-zero emissions, there will be residual emissions because some sectors and end users will not be able to eliminate the use of hydrocarbons. Some of these residual emissions will need\u00a0to be stored.</p><p>Today, carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities around the world can capture and store around 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CO2. Accelerating the pace of CCS deployment requires continued collaboration between governments, industry and investors, among others, to help unlock financing capacity, accelerate technology development and encourage public support.\u00a0We recognise the scale of the challenge in developing CCS globally as quickly and as widely as needed.</p><p>Today, Shell is involved in seven of the 51 large-scale CCS projects globally, listed in 2019 by the Global CCS Institute. These seven projects store around 5 mtpa of CO2, or around 12.5% of global CCS capacity. By the end of 2020, for example, our Quest CCS project in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 5.5 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating\u00a0in 2015.</p><p>In Norway, Shell, our project partners and the Norwegian government have taken the final investment decision on the Northern Lights CCS project. This transformative project aims to become the first carbon storage facility with capacity to transport and store CO2from industrial facilities in Norway and potentially from across Europe.</p><p>In 2020, Shell invested around $70 million in CCS. This included progressing opportunities and operating costs for CCS assets in which Shell has an interest. We seek to have access to 25 mtpa of CCS capacity by 2035 - equal to 25 CCS facilities the size of our Quest project, or around 20% of the capacity of all CCS projects being studied around the world today.</p><p>STRUCTURING OUR BUSINESS TO MEET DEMANDOur business has three pillars: Growth, Transition and Upstream. Within\u00a0each pillar, we expect the underlying businesses to evolve and\u00a0transform as demand for our products changes, driven through our\u00a0sector-based businesses.</p><p>Our Upstream pillar delivers the cash and returns needed to fund our shareholder distributions and the transformation of our company, and provides vital supplies of oil and natural gas which the world needs today.</p><p>Our Transition pillar comprises Integrated Gas, and our Chemicals and Products business, and it makes the products needed to enable the energy transition. It produces sustainable cash flow and gives us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our Growth business.</p><p>Our Growth pillar includes our service stations, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. It focuses on\u00a0working with our customers to accelerate the transition to net zero and\u00a0is the foundation for the future businesses in Shell.</p><p>In our Upstream pillar:We will focus our portfolio on nine core positions that generate more than 80% of Upstream's cash flow from operations. These core positions will attract around 80% of Upstream's capital spending. They are positions where we have superior capabilities, the potential for growth and access to strong integration with our Integrated Gas and Trading activities.</p><p>The rest of our positions will be run on a leaner operating model. They will\u00a0be tasked with either maximising cash generation or becoming core positions. In some cases, such as onshore Egypt and the Philippines, we will simply divest. We will reduce annual spending on exploration from around $2.2 billion in 2015 to around $1.5 billion between 2021 and 2025. We have attractive exploration opportunities in the first half of\u00a0this\u00a0decade. But after 2025, we do not anticipate entries into new\u00a0frontier\u00a0exploration positions.</p><p>In our Transition pillar:We intend to extend our leadership in LNG volumes and markets, with selective investments in competitive LNG assets to deliver more than 7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of new capacity on-stream by the middle of the decade. We will continue to support customers with their own net-zero ambitions, with offers such as carbon-neutral LNG, which uses\u00a0nature-based carbon credits to offset full life-cycle emissions, including methane. Our petrochemical business will continue to grow and provide products that enhance the efficiency of energy use.</p><p>We intend to reduce the number of refineries from 13 sites today to six\u00a0high-value chemicals and energy parks, and reduce production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030, from around 100 mtpa to 45 mtpa. We\u00a0intend to grow volumes from our chemicals portfolio and increase cash generation from Chemicals by $1-2 billion a year by 2030. We\u00a0will\u00a0produce chemicals from recycled waste, and by 2025 aim\u00a0to\u00a0process\u00a01 million tonnes a year of plastic waste.</p><p>LNG DEMAND TO GROW AS GAS PROVIDES MORE AND CLEANER ENERGYREDUCE CO2AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY</p><p>Natural gas emits between 45% and 55% less GHG than coal when used to generate electricity and less than one-tenth of the air pollutantsMore than 750 million tonnes of CO2savings as a result of coal-to-gas switching over the last decadeIn 2020, for the first time on record, the number of coal-fired power stations decreased</p><p>LNG NEEDED TO CONNECT NATURAL GAS SUPPLY AND DEMAND GROWTHEstimated LNG trade volume in 2040, million tonnes</p><p>In our Growth pillar:Our Marketing business is our single largest customer-facing business. In\u00a02020, Marketing delivered more than $4.5 billion in net earnings and, by 2025, we expect it to generate more than $6 billion. We will achieve this by improving the market-leading position of our lubricants business, and by increasing the number of retail sites and daily customers we serve from\u00a046,000 and 30 million respectively today, to 55,000 and 40 million by 2025. We will also achieve this by growing non-fuel sales at our retail sites and sales of electricity.</p><p>This growing number of customers, made up of large and small businesses as well as individual consumers, will be looking to decarbonise their energy consumption over the coming decades. We intend to provide them\u00a0with the options to do this, from low-carbon solutions such as clean\u00a0electricity, hydrogen and biofuels, to carbon sinks or offsets for\u00a0any\u00a0remaining carbon emissions.</p><p>Shell is increasing the number of electric vehicle charging points globally - for homeowners and businesses and for use on our forecourts - from more than 60,000 today to more than 500,000 by 2025 and to\u00a02.5\u00a0million by 2030. By comparison, that is around 7% of the total number\u00a0of public and private charge points expected in Europe alone\u00a0by\u00a02030, according to research by Bloomberg.</p><p>As the need for biofuels grows, in line with customer demand and policies to reduce transport-related emissions, we expect to extend our leading biofuels production and distribution business, which in 2020 sold 9.5\u00a0billion litres of biofuels. Our joint venture Ra\u00edzen, which produces low-carbon biofuels from sugar cane in Brazil, recently announced the\u00a0acquisition of Biosev. This is set to increase Ra\u00edzen's bioethanol production capacity by 50%, to 3.75 billion litres a year, around 3%\u00a0of\u00a0global production.</p><p>We aim for our power business to sell around 560 terawatt hours of electricity a year by 2030, which is twice as much electricity as we sell today, and for the electricity we sell to have lower carbon intensity than the grid average within the markets where we operate. We are growing\u00a0our power businesses with a focus on Europe, the USA, Australia\u00a0and Asia.</p><p>CLEAN HYDROGEN GLOBAL DEMAND PROJECTIONSMillion tonnes per annum</p><p>Source: Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Economy Outlook (2020), IEA low-carbon hydrogen production data, IEA Sustainable development scenario 2030, Shell analysis</p><p>Building clean hydrogenWe intend to build on Shell's leading position in hydrogen by developing integrated hydrogen hubs initially to serve industry and heavy-duty transport. We will begin by producing and supplying hydrogen for our\u00a0own manufacturing sites, especially refineries. For example, we are developing a hydrogen electrolyser at our refinery in Rheinland, Germany, which produces hydrogen from renewable sources. We will also continue to extend our network of hydrogen retail stations, with an increasing focus on heavy-duty transport.</p><p>The clean hydrogen market is still in the early stages and the volumes are\u00a0still modest [L]. But we see strong potential for growth especially in hard-to-abate sectors of the economy. We aim to achieve a double-digit market share of global clean hydrogen sales by 2030.</p><p>[L] Shell's definition of clean hydrogen includes hydrogen made from renewable sources (usually referred to as green hydrogen) and hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (usually referred to as blue hydrogen).</p><p>RENEWABLES AND ENERGY SOLUTIONS: INTEGRATED POWER STRATEGY FOCUSED ON REGIONAL LEADERSHIPEUROPE</p><p>In top three electric vehicle charging operators by volume</p><p>Energy solutions</p><p>Around 1 million customers of integrated home energy solutions (Shell Energy Retail)More than 80,000 operated electric vehicle charge points (primarily through NewMotion)Intelligent home battery energy storage (60,000 sonnen battery customers worldwide)Sustained growth of the commercial and industrial portfolio with more than 10,000 customers across key markets</p><p>Trading and optimisation</p><p>Growing power trading business across EuropeA leading player in the UK distributed energy market (Limejump)</p><p>Renewable assets</p><p>The Netherlands: 160 MW of renewable generation capacity in operation and 1.6 GW in development across solar and wind*Germany: 10 MW hydrogen electrolyser (RefHyne) expected to start\u00a0production in the summer of 2021Ireland: 300 MW floating wind farm (Emerald) in early-stage development, Shell share 51%</p><p>Shell is increasing the number of electric vehicle charging points globally for homeowners and businesses.</p><p>* Renewable generation capacity figures are gross.

They also allow us\u00a0to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets. This strong financial framework is\u00a0based on sector-leading cash flow, continued capital discipline, capital flexibility and a strong balance sheet.</p><p>THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK THAT SUPPORTS OUR STRATEGYWe look to achieve the right balance between shareholder distributions and investing for the future, laying the foundation for both increased distributions and share price appreciation.</p><p>While our net debt is above the level of $65 billion, we plan to invest $19-22 billion a year across our portfolio. This will sustain our core businesses while funding moderate growth.</p><p>Once we have reduced net debt to $65 billion, we will look to further increase total shareholder distributions. Through progressive dividend and share buybacks, we are targeting total distributions to shareholders of 20-30% of our cash flow from operations. We will also seek to increase capital spending in a disciplined way. With this approach we expect that we will:</p><p>1) Limit our investments in Upstream. Our oil production peaked in 2019\u00a0and we expect that it will gradually decline by 1-2% a year through to\u00a02030.</p><p>2) Maintain our investments in our Transition businesses. We expect to\u00a0see the share of gas rise to 55% of our hydrocarbon production in\u00a02030.</p><p>3) Increase investments in our Growth businesses to build material low-carbon businesses of significant scale by the early 2030s.</p><p>As Shell progresses towards being a net-zero emissions energy business our cash\u00a0flows will increasingly come from our Growth pillar, becoming less exposed to oil and gas prices with a stronger link to broader economic growth. As one of the largest commodity traders in the world, we expect additional opportunities to enhance cash delivery through integration and\u00a0optimisation.</p><p>The characteristics of our Growth pillar mean that levels of capital investment are likely to be a poor proxy for the scale of the transformation of our business. Instead, we believe the best way to measure our progress towards our targets is through the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, and the cash flows delivered by our business pillars. This is because our Growth pillar is likely to be less capital intensive than our\u00a0Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>OUR CARBON FRAMEWORKWe will take the same approach to managing and reducing our emissions as we have done for managing our financial framework, that is by setting constraints, or budgets.</p><p>We will be setting carbon budgets for all our businesses and these will\u00a0help to drive investment decisions which will in turn drive down our\u00a0emissions. In this way, we will decouple our business growth from carbon, transforming what we sell and what we produce.</p><p>By assessing our investments and resources on the basis of our financial performance, and on the carbon intensity of our revenues, we will decide what changes to make to our business portfolio.</p><p>The carbon emissions constraints we place on our businesses will tighten over time, in line with our carbon intensity targets and as demand for low-carbon products increases.</p><p>We are setting carbon budgets for all our businesses and these will help to drive investment decisions which will in turn drive down our emissions.</p><p>TRACK RECORD OF SECTOR-LEADING CFFO$ billion</p><p>Peer range comprises ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Total, CFFO for</p><p>SHELL CORRECTED FOR INTEREST RECEIVED (IN CFFI) AND INTEREST PAID (CFFF).</p><p>FUTURE-PROOFING OUR CASH FLOWS%</p><p>CASH CAPEX EVOLUTION</p><p>CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH THE ENERGY TRANSITIONWe are shifting capital from our Upstream business to our Transition and Growth businesses as the energy transition accelerates and we sell more\u00a0low-carbon energy products.</p><p>We aim to find the right balance between managing our Upstream assets - which will produce the returns needed to help us fund the transition - and investing in our Transition and Growth businesses. These businesses are essential to identify, build and scale up profitable projects that offer\u00a0low-carbon energy solutions for our customers. Our investments in our three business pillars are characterised by several factors including:</p><p>GROWTH:</p><p>Compared with our conventional Upstream assets, investments in\u00a0low- and zero-carbon solutions can require lower amounts of\u00a0capital.The levels of capital investment needed to maintain a renewable energy business are also likely to be lower than in capital-intensive complex engineering projects common in the oil and\u00a0gas industry, with their ongoing need for asset renewal and\u00a0resource replenishment.We can grow our sales of low-carbon energy without necessarily\u00a0investing in producing it ourselves by buying it from third parties and selling it to our customers. This model is part of\u00a0our business today, we sell more than three times the energy we produce ourselves.We can enter into different types of financial arrangements that\u00a0enable renewable generation capacity to be built, without bearing the full capital cost of the project. For example, developing renewable production as part of joint ventures allows\u00a0us to reduce the capital investment needed, while giving us access to valuable expertise from other partners. It also gives us the opportunity to secure a substantial portion of the energy produced, allowing us to grow customer sales (See box Offshore\u00a0wind).Our investments in our Marketing business will help decarbonise the energy system by increasing the provision of charging for electric vehicles and increasing the use of biofuels and low- and\u00a0zero-carbon lubricants.</p><p>TRANSITION:</p><p>Our investments in natural gas can help to decarbonise energy\u00a0use when it replaces energy with a higher carbon intensity such as coal and fuel for shipping.Restructuring our refinery business into energy parks will transform our business away from our traditional oil-based energy products.</p><p>UPSTREAM:</p><p>Most of our investments in our Upstream business are in maintaining assets and sustaining the value of the portfolio.Our existing Upstream assets are critical to delivering near-term cash flow and to enabling moderate growth. Our investments to improve the efficiency of our oil and gas\u00a0facilities can help reduce our operational emissions.</p><p>INVESTING IN OIL AND GASA natural decline in production happens in oil and gas reservoirs at a\u00a0rate of around 5% a year across the oil and gas industry. It takes constant reinvestment to sustain production and extract resources.</p><p>Our planned capital investment of $8 billion in our Upstream business in the near term is well below the investment level required to offset the natural decline in production of our oil and gas reservoirs, and will not sustain current levels of production.</p><p>As a result of this planned level of capital investment, we expect a gradual decline of about 1-2% a year in total oil production through to\u00a02030, including divestments.</p><p>Powering lives by providing energy to homes.</p><p>OFFSHORE WINDShell is part of the Blauwwind Consortium that was awarded the right to develop, construct and operate the Borssele III and IV wind farm off the Dutch coast. Shell entered with a 40% share in 2016 and\u00a0Shell Energy Europe Limited secured a contract to sell 50% of the power produced. We sold half of our joint venture partnership in\u00a02018 when we brought on board an additional partner. The wind farm is now fully operational and has a total installed capacity of 731.5 MW, equivalent to powering 825,000 Dutch households. We\u00a0still sell 50% of the power produced.</p><p>Shell is part of a consortium that has developed a wind farm off the Dutch coast. We\u00a0sell 50% of the power produced.</p><p>CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENTRobust and sustainable government policies will be critical to help the world achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and net-zero emissions by 2050. These must include policies that accelerate the move to low-carbon energy in industries that are hard to\u00a0decarbonise, sector by\u00a0sector.</p><p>Shell's Powering Progress strategy includes working with governments to\u00a0support the policies and regulatory frameworks to accelerate the\u00a0transition to net zero.</p><p>We are seeing a growing number of countries aiming for net-zero emissions and enhancing their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The USA has recently rejoined the Paris Agreement, for example, China has set out its plans to reach net zero by 2060, and the European Union (EU) has committed to climate neutrality, or net-zero emissions, in\u00a02050.</p><p>ENGAGING WITH GOVERNMENTSOur expertise in providing energy can help to shape effective policy, legislation and regulation, and we engage with governments, regulators and policymakers directly and indirectly, including through industry associations. We are also working with other companies, governments and investors through coalitions to identify the policies needed in sectors such as aviation, shipping and road freight to help change demand and\u00a0enable faster decarbonisation.</p><p>We are members of the Mission Possible Partnership sectoral coalitions for\u00a0aviation, shipping, road freight and steel. Each of these coalitions works to help accelerate decarbonisation pathways, including through policy engagement. For example, we are a member of the Clean Skies for\u00a0Tomorrow initiative, which has developed a joint policy proposal for\u00a0a\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel mandate in the EU which would require airlines to\u00a0use an increasing ratio of sustainable aviation fuel.</p><p>Shell is also a member of the Jet Zero Council (JZC) in the UK, a partnership between industry and government. JZC aims to deliver zero-emission transatlantic flight within a generation, and to drive new technologies and\u00a0innovative ways to cut aviation emissions. Shell is also a member of the\u00a0European Round Table for Industry (ERT) which has called on the EU institutions to introduce sectoral roadmaps to net-zero emissions [M].</p><p>GREATER TRANSPARENCYWe aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around political engagement. We set out our approach, including our principles for responsible lobbying, in our statement on corporate political engagement which is published on our website [N].</p><p>Our principles for participation in industry associations govern how we manage our relationships with industry associations on climate-related policy. They build on the Shell General Business Principles and the Shell Code of Conduct, and have been incorporated in the Shell Control Framework, which sets the requirements for how all Shell entities operate. The principles aim to ensure our memberships of industry associations do not undermine our support for the Paris Agreement and that they support the development of government policies that could help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>In 2019, we published our first Industry Associations Climate Review, and\u00a0were one of the first companies to report this information [O]. The\u00a0review\u00a0assessed our climate-related policy alignment with 19\u00a0industry\u00a0associations against our 2019 climate-related policy positions.\u00a0The\u00a0following year we published an update to our review.</p><p>In 2020, we updated Shell's climate-related policy positions and published them on our website [P]. These positions include support for the\u00a0goal of the Paris Agreement and for the development of policies to help the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. They also include support for carbon pricing, carbon capture utilisation and\u00a0storage and\u00a0nature-based offsets.</p><p>In the newly published 2021 Industry Associations Climate Review, we\u00a0have reviewed 36 associations. We plan to publish our next update\u00a0in\u00a02022.</p><p>We will continue to work with governments, other companies, investors, non-governmental organisations, coalitions and industry associations to\u00a0help society achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and net-zero emissions. We will also continue to work towards greater transparency around climate lobbying and reporting.</p><p>[M]<url normalizedValue=\"https://ert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-25-Statement-on-Sectoral-Approaches.pdf\">https://ert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-25-Statement-on-Sectoral-Approaches.pdf</url>[N]<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>[O]2019 Industry Associations Climate Review <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>[P] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/advocacy-and-political-activity.html\">https://www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/advocacy-and-political-activity.html</url></p><p>A JUST TRANSITIONThe energy transition will create employment and opportunities for people to learn new skills. It may also adversely affect workers and communities, for example in areas where traditional products, business activities or jobs are\u00a0phased out.The Paris Agreement refers to the importance of a just transition, recognising that governments must take into account the workers affected by the shift to a low-carbon economy, and create \"decent work and quality jobs\". The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement, has defined decent work as \"jobs that provide adequate incomes and social protection, safe working conditions, respect for rights at work and effective social dialogues\".</p><p>Our Powering Progress strategy seeks to support livelihoods, communities and an inclusive society as we transform our business to meet our target of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with\u00a0society.</p><p>One of the strategy's four main goals is powering lives, which sets out how we support livelihoods and communities. As we transform, we will continue to provide jobs, encourage local businesses to be part of our supply chain, promote entrepreneurship and offer skills training in communities where we operate.</p><p>We are working to help find viable ways to provide low-carbon energy that can support successful local economies. To do this we will work with governments, local communities, customers, employees, employee representative bodies, suppliers and industry groups.</p><p>We seek to work with contractors and suppliers who contribute to sustainable development and are economically, environmentally and socially responsible.</p><p>Our employees and their well-being are critical to the success of our business. During the energy transition, Shell will continue to respect workers' rights in line with the 1998 Declaration of the Fundamental Principles of Rights at Work published by the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO). We will continue to comply with ILO occupational health and safety standards and applicable laws and practices.</p><p>As portfolio changes affect our assets during the energy transition, we\u00a0will\u00a0seek to:</p><p>continue to engage with employees, employee representative bodies and relevant government bodies at a local level, keeping them informed about our plans and listening to any concerns;provide wages and benefits that meet or exceed the national legal standards; andprovide equal opportunity in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and rewards.</p><p>DEVELOPING SKILLS FOR THE FUTUREAs our portfolio changes, we will seek to help employees develop skills for the future. This will strengthen their long-term employment prospects and enable them to seize opportunities created by the energy transition.</p><p>For example, the Pulau Bukom manufacturing site in Singapore will be affected by organisational changes and job reductions as it becomes one\u00a0of our energy and chemicals parks. We aim to significantly reduce Bukom's carbon dioxide emissions as the site produces fewer crude-oil, fuels-based products, instead favouring lower-carbon alternatives that may include biofuels. But over the course of three years, staff numbers will\u00a0go from the current level of around 1,300 to around 800.</p><p>We have partnered with the Singapore Shell Employees' Union to launch a Joint Capability Council (JCC) to help staff acquire new skills that will enable them to succeed in future roles. The JCC will help develop courses for employees in areas such as digital literacy and data analytics.</p><p>The JCC builds upon the UpSkill ShellSG initiative for all staff in Singapore. The UpSkill initiative allows our Singapore staff to access training in a wide range of subjects including digital skills, tech-enabled services, advanced manufacturing, leadership and project management. The initiative was developed in collaboration with local authorities who shared the aim of helping workers acquire skills that will enable them to succeed in the economy of the future.</p><p>SUPPORTING THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE\u00a0DEVELOPMENT GOALSThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to address the\u00a0world's biggest challenges, including ending poverty, improving health\u00a0and education, and tackling climate change. Governments are responsible for implementing approaches that meet the SDGs, but success\u00a0will require unprecedented collaboration and collective action involving businesses and civil society.</p><p>As a leading energy company, we will play our part in supporting the SDGs. Energy plays a critical role in enabling economic and social development and improving people's livelihoods. The supply of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for addressing global challenges, including those related to poverty and inequality. That\u00a0is why we are working to provide energy to those who do not have\u00a0it\u00a0today.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency, in 2019 there were around\u00a0770 million people in the world who lacked access to electricity. Hundreds of millions more are estimated to have an unreliable energy supply. One of our ambitions is that by 2030 we will provide reliable electricity to 100 million people in Africa and Asia who do not yet have it.</p><p>To help achieve this, we are developing market-based programmes that provide access to clean and affordable energy for some of the world's most remote and vulnerable people. We are investing in companies that specialise in solar home systems, mini-grids, and other innovations that improve access to energy. As well as managing our existing portfolio, we\u00a0are also seeking to develop large-scale power projects in key markets\u00a0and to use our global partnerships to improve access to energy.</p><p>POWERING LIVES THROUGH OUR ACTIVITIESManaging the impact of our activities on people living near our operations is essential to being a responsible organisation. Many of our operations are located close to communities, and we work with them to understand their priorities and concerns. In doing this we use international standards as our benchmark, including the International Finance Corporation's Environmental and Social Performance Standards - as well as our own rigorous standards.</p><p>We employ people in more than 70 countries, providing income and benefits such as health care and pensions. Every year, we spend tens of\u00a0billions of dollars on goods and services in the communities where we\u00a0operate. Our activities generate revenues for governments through the\u00a0taxes and royalties we pay and the sales taxes we collect on their behalf. This helps fund health care, education, transport and other essential services.</p><p>We strengthen local economies and employment opportunities through enterprise development programmes such as Shell LiveWIRE. The overall goal of these programmes is to enable communities to participate in and benefit from the stimulation of social and economic development. In 2020, 19,319 people participated in our programmes, which also supported 1,017 businesses. This helped create 1,805 jobs. In 2020, 99 businesses supported by Shell LiveWIRE entered our supply chain.</p><p>CLIMATE GOVERNANCEClimate change and risks resulting from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a significant risk factor for Shell. They are managed in accordance with other significant risks through the Board and\u00a0the Executive Committee.The Board committees play an important role in assisting the Board with regard to governance and oversight of management of climate change risks and opportunities, as described in the Annual Report. The Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) assists the Board in\u00a0reviewing the practices and the performance of the Shell Group of companies, primarily with respect to safety, environment including climate\u00a0change, and sustainability.</p><p>When reviewing these areas and deciding how to advise the Board, SESCo takes into account the Shell General Business Principles, Code of\u00a0Conduct, and HSSE &amp; SP Control Framework. SESCo's duties include reviewing Shell's progress towards meeting our climate targets and the energy transition. SESCo also advises the Remuneration Committee (REMCO) on metrics relating to sustainable development and energy\u00a0transition.</p><p>INCENTIVES AND REMUNERATIONThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the Directors' Remuneration Policy, in alignment with our business strategy.</p><p>Starting in 2021, we are increasing the weight associated with GHG emissions management in the annual scorecard, which helps determine the annual bonus levels for all our employees, including members of the Executive Committee. The GHG emissions intensity metric and its weight (10%) will remain unaltered, but we will add a new metric that measures the execution of GHG-abatement projects with a weight of 5%.</p><p>Performance Share Plan and Long-term Incentive Plan [Q]For 2021 awards made under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the\u00a0weighting of the energy transition condition has doubled from 5% to\u00a010%. For 2021, the weighting of the energy transition condition in the\u00a0Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) will also double from 10% to 20%. The\u00a0target range is\u00a0a 6-8% reduction in net carbon intensity by 2023 against the 2016 baseline NCF of 79 grams of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) equivalent per megajoule.</p><p>The other targets linked to our strategic ambitions will also evolve, with the\u00a0metric connected to commercialising advanced biofuel technology broadening to a measure of growing new cleaner energy product offerings. The targets for the leading energy transition measures are commercially sensitive and will be disclosed retrospectively. The energy transition condition was included again in the 2020 LTIP awards for Executive Directors and Senior Executives and was also incorporated into\u00a0the Performance Share Plan awards made to around 16,500 employees globally.</p><p>\u00a0[Q]Executive Directors and Executive Committee members participate in the LTIP. Around 150 Senior Executives participate in the same plan. The measures and metrics for that plan also apply to 50% of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) awarded to around 16,500 employees.</p><p>TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD)This publication and the description of our\u00a0energy transition strategy are part of\u00a0our continuing work to implement the\u00a0recommendations of the Task Force\u00a0on\u00a0Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).</p><p>We assess our portfolio decisions, including investments and divestments, against the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and the energy transition. These include for example, policy actions such as higher regulatory costs linked to carbon emissions and demand changes which lower demand for oil and gas.</p><p>MANAGING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIESOur approach to assessing and managing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change includes considering different time horizons. The time horizons and their relevance to risks, opportunities and business planning are as follows:</p><p>Short term (up to three years): we develop detailed financial projections and use them to manage performance and expectations on a three-year cycle. Medium term (generally three to 10 years): most of our expected production and earnings in this period come from our existing assets. Long term (generally beyond 10 years): for this period, it is expected that the current Shell portfolio will change and evolve with the energy transition. Decision-making and risk identification on the thematic structure of the future portfolio are guided by the pace of society's progress and the aim of being in step with society as it moves towards the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The overall climate change risk consists of four components, based on the nature of our exposure and the options for our mitigation responses. The four components are regulatory risks, commercial risks, physical risks and societal risks. We provide more details about how we manage these in our Annual Report.</p><p>SCENARIOSOur portfolio and strategy have been assessed against a wide range of\u00a0outlooks. These include the potential impacts of various possible energy\u00a0transition pathways, and changes in societal expectations around\u00a0climate change. Our latest set of Shell scenarios [R] was one of\u00a0the\u00a0many variables used in guiding our updated strategy which we\u00a0announced in February 2021.</p><p>SENSITIVITY TO OIL PRICESWe estimate that a $10 per barrel change in oil prices would have an impact of roughly $6 billion per year on our cash flow from operations. Of\u00a0this, $4 billion would come from Upstream and $2 billion from our Integrated Gas business. Cash flows from our Growth pillar and Chemicals and Products businesses have limited exposure to commodity prices and so are not included in this calculation. This is an indicative estimate and not a prediction.</p><p>Based on this assumption, if the oil price sustainably increased by around $15 per barrel, as it did in January and February 2021, that would be expected to create an additional $9 billion in medium-term cash flow per year from operations from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. Similarly, a $15 fall in the oil price would be expected to result in a $9 billion reduction in cash flow from operations per year in the medium term.</p><p>[R] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/the-energy-transformation-scenarios\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/the-energy-transformation-scenarios</url></p><p>SENSITIVITY TO GOVERNMENT-LED CO2PRICESShell views carbon pricing as a key policy tool for meeting the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement as it helps to increase demand\u00a0for low-carbon energy and creates incentives for investment in\u00a0low-carbon technologies and infrastructure.</p><p>Shell's annual carbon cost exposure is expected to increase over the next decade because of evolving carbon regulations. This expected increase is based on forecasts of Shell's equity share of emissions from operated and non-operated assets, and real-terms carbon cost estimates which range from $5 to $110 per tonne of GHG emissions in 2030. This exposure also takes into account the estimated impact of free allowances as relevant to assets based on their location. The regulatory carbon cost estimate is refreshed on an annual basis as part of the development of our business plan.</p><p>RISK OF STRANDED ASSETSEvery year we test our portfolio under different scenarios, including prolonged low oil prices. In addition, we rank the break-even prices of our assets in the Upstream business to assess their resilience against low oil and gas prices. At December 31, 2020, we estimate that around 75% of\u00a0our current proved oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2030 and\u00a0only around 3% after 2040. We also estimate that around 70% of\u00a0our proved plus probable oil and gas reserves, known as 2P, will be\u00a0produced\u00a0by 2030, and only 5% after 2040.</p><p>EVOLVING REGULATORY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTSDisclosure requirements related to climate-related risks and opportunities are evolving and may result in more stringent disclosure mandates.

We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these\u00a0forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is\u00a0dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of the company, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and\u00a0could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort.

Within\u00a0each pillar, we expect the underlying businesses to evolve and\u00a0transform as demand for our products changes, driven through our\u00a0sector-based businesses. Our Upstream pillar delivers the cash and returns needed to fund our shareholder distributions and the transformation of our company, and provides vital supplies of oil and natural gas which the world needs today. Our Transition pillar comprises Integrated Gas, and our Chemicals and Products business, and it makes the products needed to enable the energy transition. It produces sustainable cash flow and gives us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our Growth business. Our Growth pillar includes our service stations, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. It focuses on\u00a0working with our customers to accelerate the transition to net zero and\u00a0is the foundation for the future businesses in Shell. In our Upstream pillar:We will focus our portfolio on nine core positions that generate more than 80% of Upstream's cash flow from operations. These core positions will attract around 80% of Upstream's capital spending. They are positions where we have superior capabilities, the potential for growth and access to strong integration with our Integrated Gas and Trading activities.

Growth was well balanced with beer volume up 3.1% and revenue per hectolitre up 3.3%, driven by robust pricing and focus on premiumisation. The Heineken\u00ae brand growth accelerated to 8.3%, with more than 40 countries delivering double digit growth. The successful roll-out of Heineken\u00ae 0.0 continued and it is now available in 57 markets.</p><p>Our strategy continues to be growth oriented with an ever-increasing emphasis on the sustainability of this growth, both socially and environmentally. Over the past decade, we have lowered our water usage by almost a third to 3.4 hectolitres of water per hectolitre produced, ahead of our 2020 target.

The underlying price mix on a constant geographic basis was up 3.4%. In the second half of the year net revenue (beia) increased 5.7% (1H19: 5.6%), with total consolidated volume growth of 2.0% (1H19: 2.5%), net revenue (beia) per hectolitre up 3.6% (1H19: 3.0%) and price mix on a constant geographic basis of 3.2% (1H19: 3.5%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Consolidated beer volume</emphasis>grew 3.1% organically for the full year.

To support our employees in doing their jobs safely, we established robust COVID-19 preventive measures including working from home where possible, social distancing, strict personal hygiene and disinfection protocols, and providing adequate personal protective equipment.</p><p>We also supported our customers, suppliers and the communities most impacted by the pandemic. We assisted customers with advice, re-opening tools, stock returns and helped them set up online delivery. We supported them financially, for example, by waiving close to (EURO)50 million in rental payments. We raised over (EURO)10 million to support 50,000 outlets across 21 countries through our Back the Bars initiative. We continued to pay all suppliers on time and reduced payment terms to various small suppliers.</p><p>We provided twenty-three million Euros worth of pandemic relief to support front-line medical workers in the communities where we operate, including drinking water, non-alcoholic beverages, hand sanitiser, and monetary contributions. These included a (EURO)15 million donation to the International Red Cross. In Mexico, we announced a dry ice donation of 55 tons to help safely transport vaccines at low-temperatures. The de Carvalho-Heineken family together with their holding company donated (EURO)10 million to eight charities supporting the COVID-19 relief efforts.</p><p>Our people adapted quickly and took decisive actions to guarantee business continuity. We entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet and took immediate steps to strengthen our liquidity. We took action to swiftly reduce discretionary expenses and mitigate the impact on our business performance while protecting the future. Our commercial teams reallocated resources across channels and brands, increasing their focus on off-trade customers. We accelerated the deployment of our e-commerce platforms, capitalising on digitalisation trends as consumers and customers shopped online. Our supply chain teams demonstrated great agility to adapt to a radically different and volatile environment with excellent efficiency and minimum disruptions. As a result, we outperformed the market in most of our key markets.</p><p>In parallel, our colleagues in support functions adapted quickly to working from home, produced timely rolling-forecasts to inform decisions and managed eight, remotely supported, deployments of our standardised ERP platforms in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.</p><p>Finally, we continued to shape our business for growth, with our entry into Peru, the acquisition of Strongbow in Australia, and the restructuring of our Philippines' business.</p><p>TOP-LINE PERFORMANCE</p><p>COVID-19 continues to have a material impact on our top-line performance, affecting all geographies and markets as governments across the world took measures to mitigate the contagion including restricted population movement, social distancing, outlet closures and temporary lockdowns of production facilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net revenue (beia)</emphasis>declined 11.9% organically, with a 9.8% decrease in total consolidated volume and a 2.4% decrease in net revenue (beia) per hectolitre due to country mix effects and non-volume related revenue decline.

Currency translation negatively impacted net revenue (beia) by (EURO)1,259 million or 5.3%, mainly driven by the Brazilian Real, the Mexican Peso, the Nigerian Naira, the Russian Rouble and the South African Rand.</p><p>The second half of the year benefited from a good summer with some easing of operating constraints including in the European on-trade. Net revenue (beia) decreased 7.8%. Total consolidated volume declined 6.4% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre was down 1.5% (2H19: 3.6% up).

Amstel declined driven by Europe and South Africa despite double-digit growth in Brazil and Mexico. Sol declined driven by Mexico but grew double-digits\u00a0\u00a0in the UK, Chile and Argentina.

The no-alcohol portfolio grew mid-single-digit, driven by Heineken\u00ae 0.0 globally and Maltina in Nigeria.</p><p>We entered the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hard Seltzer</emphasis>category with Pure Pira\u00f1a in Mexico and New Zealand in September and more launches will come in 2021. In Mexico, Pure Pira\u00f1a is the first nationwide seltzer brand available across all channels, complemented by Amstel Ultra Seltzer, launched in January 2021. In the USA, together with AriZona we announced the launch of AriZona SunRise Hard Seltzer in 2021.</p><p>Our<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e-commerce platforms</emphasis>showed strong growth as digitalisation trends accelerated, consumers changed shopping patterns and customers adapted to new realities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beerwulf</emphasis>, our direct-to-consumer platform in Europe, nearly doubled its revenues. All markets grew strongly, most notably the UK where revenues tripled. Online sales of our home-draught systems the Sub and Blade grew in the mid-double-digits.All together our<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">direct-to-consumer platforms</emphasis>Beerwulf, Six2Go and Drinkies tripled the number of orders from consumers in the year. We continued to deploy our<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">business-to-business digital platforms</emphasis>at speed. We are operational in 25 markets covering more than (EURO)1 billion of our net revenue as we connect more than 100,000 customers in traditional channels.Our platforms also include<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">digital connections</emphasis>to cashier systems and on-trade equipment, including fridges and draught beer columns. By the end of 2020, we connected to more than 130,000 customers globally.</p><p>SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY</p><p>2020 was an unprecedented year in which we continued to advance against all our sustainable development ambitions, with people's health and safety at the heart of our response to the pandemic. 2020 also marked an inflexion point as we concluded our decade-long<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brewing a Better World</emphasis>commitments and paved the way for our next phase of sustainability and responsibility ambitions.</p><p>Over the last decade we made significant progress on all six of our focus areas, designed to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals, including to promote health and safety in our operations, protect our water resources, reduce CO2emissions, source sustainably, advocate responsible consumption, and grow with the communities where we operate.</p><p>For years, we have been a staunch advocate for making moderate consumption cool by targeting an investment of 10% of Heineken\u00ae media spend to support<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">responsible consumption</emphasis>campaigns in every market where we sell and advertise Heineken\u00ae. One of our key platforms is the Heineken\u00ae Formula 1 partnership to promote \"When You Drive, Never Drink\". In 2020, we complemented this campaign with Heineken\u00ae 0.0, offering consumers an alternative no-alcohol option if they do need to drive. Given the exceptional circumstances in 2020, we redirected part of our 10% Heineken\u00ae media investments from 'responsible consumption' to 'socialise responsibly' campaigns, reminding consumers to embrace social distancing and other safety measures.</p><p>Our<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">carbon emissions</emphasis>in production reduced a further 3.0% in 2020 to 5.1 kilograms of CO2per hectolitre produced bringing the total reduction to 51% since 2008. After meeting our targetted carbon emission reduction in production early, we launched our 'Drop the C' programme in 2018 to reduce CO2emissions with a target to power our production facilities with 70% renewable thermal and electrical energy by 2030. In 2020, we reached 22% renewable energy in our production facilities, through wind and solar power, and sustainable biomass projects. Heineken\u00ae is now brewed with 100% green energy in the Netherlands and Brazil for the domestic markets.</p><p>We reduced<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">water usage</emphasis>by a third since 2008 to 3.4 hectolitres of water per hectolitre produced and 3.1 hectolitres in water-stressed areas, two years ahead of plan. In March 2019, we introduced our 2030 water ambition 'Every Drop', which looks beyond traditional water efficiency metrics to put the health of local watersheds front and centre. Ten production sites located in Mexico, Spain and Egypt replenished more water in the respective watersheds than used in their final products through nature-based solutions and infrastructure improvement projects.</p><p>We significantly increased our raw materials from<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">sustainable sources</emphasis>to 58% (2019: 37%), exceeding our 2020 target. Although we slightly increased our local sourcing percentage of agricultural supplies in Africa to 45% (2019: 44%), it remained below the 60% target for 2020.</p><p>On<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">safety</emphasis>, we further reduced accident frequency by 31% versus last year to 0.58 per 100 FTE, surpassing our 2020 target.</p><p>In addition to our Brewing a Better World programme, we use the power of our<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">diversity</emphasis>as the most international brewer to create a more<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">inclusive</emphasis>work environment. At the end of 2020, there were 61 nationalities (2016: 53) and 23% female representation among our senior managers (2016: 17%). We continue to leverage our brands' strength as a force for good and build strong marketing campaigns to raise awareness on crucial societal issues, such as the Heineken\u00ae #CheersToAll campaign addressing gender stereotypes.</p><p>In 2021 we will continue to Raise the Bar on responsible consumption, environmental and social sustainability and will announce a new 2030 ambition for Brewing a Better World.</p><p>More details on our Sustainability and Responsibility programmes and progress will be available on our website and in our 2020 Annual Report.</p><p>OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE</p><p>Operating profit was materially impacted by the negative consequences of COVID-19, partially offset by significant mitigation actions.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operating profit (beia)</emphasis>declined 35.6% organically, with all regions in decline.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operating profit</emphasis>declined 78.6%. More than 90% of the organic operating profit (beia) decline was driven by Europe, Mexico, South Africa and Indonesia. Currency translation negatively impacted operating profit (beia) by (EURO)129 million or 3.2%, mainly driven by the Brazilian Real and the Mexican Peso.</p><p>The operating profit decline in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe</emphasis>was amplified by an over 40% volume decline in the on-trade. HEINEKEN has a strong position in the on-trade channel across Europe, including wholesale in several markets and pubs in the UK.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mexico</emphasis>, beer volume declined in the mid-teens. Operations were suspended throughout most of the second quarter and faced operating restrictions throughout the year.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">South Africa</emphasis>, total volume declined in the thirties as our strong momentum was disrupted by a COVID-related suspension of all alcohol companies in the second quarter, a ban on the sale of alcohol during July and August, and impacts to various supply chain expansion projects that constrained our capacity in the second part of the year.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Indonesia</emphasis>, total volume declined in the forties given the impact of lockdowns throughout most of the year and the absence of international tourism in the key Bali region.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Input costs</emphasis>per hectolitre increased by around 10% essentially driven by the negative impact of channel and product mix and to a lesser extent by transactional currency effects. Commodity prices had a slight positive impact.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other incremental expenses</emphasis>included higher depreciation from previous year investments, provisions for credit losses, safety &amp; protection equipment, donations and other forms of support to our customers and communities.</p><p>We implemented<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">cost mitigating actions</emphasis>throughout the year, reducing all discretionary expenses, pausing projects, and cancelling senior managers' bonuses. These actions resulted in a net organic reduction of circa (EURO)800 million of other expenses (beia). This excludes the effects on input costs, goods for resale, transport and depreciation. Most of these cost mitigation actions are by nature non-repeating benefits.</p><p>For more details, please refer to the Financial Review.</p><p>EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND IMPAIRMENTS</p><p>The impact of exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles (eia) was (EURO)1,643\u00a0million (2019: (EURO)387\u00a0million) on operating profit and (EURO)1,358\u00a0million (2019: (EURO)351\u00a0million) on net profit.</p><p>This included<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">impairments</emphasis>(net of reversal) of (EURO)963 million in tangible and intangible assets in operating profit. The impact of the crisis in developing economies and the on-trade restrictions in some developed economies triggered the need for impairment reviews. These resulted in impairments in Papua New Guinea ((EURO)246 million), Lagunitas ((EURO)230 million), various individual UK pubs ((EURO)191 million), Jamaica ((EURO)100 million, net of reversal) and various other smaller impairment charges, of which (EURO)96 million in Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe and (EURO)61 million in the Americas. For more details on the exceptional items and impairments, please refer to the Financial Review.</p><p>Exceptional items also included<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">restructuring</emphasis>costs of (EURO)331 million, essentially associated with the organisational restructuring being implemented across our markets during 2021.</p><p>NET PROFIT AND LOSS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net profit (beia)</emphasis>decreased 49.4% organically to (EURO)1,154 million (2019: (EURO)2,517 million). The decrease was higher than the decline in operating profit (beia) due to higher net finance expenses and the lower relative decline in minority interest. Currency translation negatively impacted net profit (beia) by (EURO)67 million or 2.7%, mainly driven by the Brazilian Real and the Mexican Peso.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net loss</emphasis>after exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles was (EURO)204 million (2019: (EURO)2,166\u00a0million profit).TOTAL DIVIDEND FOR 2020</p><p>The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2020, a total cash dividend of (EURO)0.70 per share, representing a decrease of 58.3% (2019: (EURO)1.68), and a payout ratio of 34.9%, in the middle of the range of our policy, will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 22 April 2021 (\"2021 AGM\"). If approved, the full dividend will be paid on 6 May 2021, as no interim dividend was paid during 2020. The payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax. Due to the reported net loss in 2020, the proposed dividend will be paid out of the equity reserves. The ex-dividend date for Heineken N.V. shares will be 26 April 2021.</p><p>2021 OUTLOOK STATEMENTS</p><p>Overall the COVID-19 pandemic and governments' measures continue to have a material impact on our markets and business. 2021 started with many restrictions across our markets, including on-trade closures and restrictions to travel. In Europe in particular, we estimate that at the end of January 2021, less than 30% of on-trade outlets were operating. Product and channel mix is expected to continue to adversely impact results, especially in Europe.</p><p>According to the World Health Organisation, the effect of vaccines on the pandemic will depend on several factors including their effectiveness, speed of their approval, manufacturing and delivery and the number of people getting vaccinated. As such, we expect the pandemic to continue to impact our business in the first half of 2021 and market conditions to gradually improve in the second part of the year.</p><p>Input costs per hectolitre are expected to be volatile due to channel and product mix effects. Based on our hedged positions for 2021, we expect a significantly higher negative transactional currency impact on input costs.</p><p>The EverGreen programme will be in full deployment.</p><p>Overall we expect revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin to stay below the level of 2019.We also anticipate:</p><p>An average effective interest rate (beia) broadly in line with 2020 (2020: 3.0%)Capital expenditure related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of around (EURO)1.8 billion (2020: (EURO)1.6 billion). The effective tax rate (beia) to stay above 2019 level due to the effect of fixed cost components in the tax line.</p><p>TRANSLATIONAL CURRENCY CALCULATED IMPACT</p><p>The translational currency impact for 2020 was negative, amounting to (EURO)1,259\u00a0million on net revenue (beia), (EURO)129 million at operating profit (beia) and (EURO)67 million at net profit (beia).</p><p>Applying spot rates as of 8 February 2021 to the 2020 financial results as a baseline, we calculate a negative currency translational impact of approximately (EURO)480 million in net revenue (beia), (EURO)70 million at operating profit (beia) and (EURO)30 million at net profit (beia).</p><p>EVERGREEN</p><p>In the second half of 2020, we embarked on a strategic review, listening to and engaging with a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. We named our journey EverGreen, drawing inspiration from nature's resilience and constant adaptation and renewal.</p><p>With EverGreen, we aim to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 crisis and build on our unique strengths to deliver superior and profitable growth in a fast-changing world. We pursue a growth algorithm that translates superior growth and continuous productivity improvements into purposeful investments and operating leverage while raising the bar on environmental sustainability, responsible consumption and our people strategy.</p><p>We provide an update of our progress below. The programme is on-going and we will provide further updates in the future.</p><p>Our unique strengths and opportunities</p><p>HEINEKEN's many strengths form a solid foundation to build upon, including:</p><p>A strong track-record of superior top-line growth The iconic Heineken\u00ae brandA footprint skewed towards growthA winning premium brand portfolio in a world where premium is poised to outperformA global leadership in non-alcoholic beer, a segment with much potential for growth</p><p>A distinctive entrepreneurial model centred on our local operationsOur HEINEKEN values and culture centred on quality and people, and Our long-term focus rooted in our 156 year history.</p><p>HEINEKEN is a superior growth company, with significant value creation potential going forward:</p><p>Enhance our portfolio and strengthen our digital route to consumer, with consumers and customers at the core Complement growth with increased productivity focusAccelerate IT simplification and capture full e-commerce potentialRaise our Brewing a Better World ambition towards 2030 Drive speed, agility and external orientation in our organisation \u00a0</p><p>Our way forward</p><p>As our markets recover, we aim to deliver<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">superior top-line growth</emphasis>with a sharpened consumer- and customer-focused strategy across five dimensions:</p><p>Expand and develop our footprint to maintain our growth advantage Focus and expand our portfolio to better serve consumers Shape and strengthen our route to consumer digitally Scale execution excellence through commercial capability building Drive intentional resource allocation towards growth.</p><p>We will<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expand and develop our footprint</emphasis>by strengthening our #1 and #2 positions and continuously expanding into new growth markets via greenfields and partnerships. We have also started to take action to resolve a number of value dilutive operations in our current footprint.</p><p>Regarding our brand portfolio, we will<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">amplify our strong premium position</emphasis>by winning value share with Heineken\u00ae, everywhere; scale and replicate the success of our international brands; and make fewer, bigger bets in local premium brands. We will also<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">stretch beer and move beyond beer</emphasis>, innovating to serve consumers better. We will make 0.0% beer available everywhere, always, with Heineken\u00ae 0.0 and no-alcohol options across our entire portfolio. We will expand beer to meet new consumer needs and occasions and move beyond beer to serve consumers better. For example, on 17 September 2020, we announced the launch of Pure Pira\u00f1a in Mexico and New Zealand, exploring the Hard Seltzer category.</p><p>We aim to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">become the best connected brewer</emphasis>, digitally enabling and strengthening our route to consumer. We will connect all our customers through our business-to-business platforms, reaching (EURO)10 billion net revenue by 2025 in traditional channels. Our entire sales force will be digitally empowered by 2023. We will continue to invest selectively in direct-to-consumer platforms and touch all consumers with Individual Data Driven Marketing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Continuous productivity improvements</emphasis>will fuel the investments required to support our growth strategy. We are building a cost management capability to continuously develop initiatives and cultivate a cost-conscious culture. At the end of 2020, we launched an initial productivity programme of (EURO)2 billion gross savings by 2023 which we estimate will have a cost to achieve of approximately (EURO)500 million OPEX and (EURO)400 million CAPEX. The programme will be key to restore our marketing and spend levels, front-load investments in digital and technology and mitigate the incremental costs from accumulated inflation and significant transactional currency costs. This cost management capability will gear us for operating leverage beyond 2023.</p><p>The initiatives to deliver the (EURO)2 billion gross savings are concentrated in three key productivity areas:</p><p>An organisational redesign in 2021 to be more efficient and effective An efficiency programme to reduce complexity and number of SKUs, reduce conversion costs in production and optimize logistics A commercial productivity programme tackling our least effective spend, fully reinvesting the productivity gains</p><p>Regarding the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">organisational redesign</emphasis>, on 28 October 2020, HEINEKEN announced a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of its organisations at head-office, regional offices and each of our local operations. The overall restructuring programme will reduce our employee base by c.8,000 people, with a total restructuring charge of around (EURO)420 million<sup>1</sup>and run-rate direct savings on personnel expenses of c.(EURO)350 million. The timelines of restructuring will vary depending on the specific circumstances of each of our local operations, including a reduction of the personnel costs at the head-office by a run-rate of c.20% to be implemented at the end of the first quarter of 2021.Our productivity programme enables<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">accelerated investments</emphasis>with<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">sharpened resource and capital allocation</emphasis>, in particular:</p><p>We will drive efficiency of our consumer and customer-focused investments, restoring our marketing and sales spend as a percentage of net revenue (beia) to the levels of 2019 by latest 2023, fully reinvesting all commercial productivity gains We will front-load investments to accelerate our digital &amp; technology transformation, including our digital route to consumer, digital core &amp; backbone, advanced analytics and global data hubsWe will sharpen our resource allocation within and across our local operationsWill maintain our disciplined use of capital, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain committed to bringing back our Net Debt to EBITDA (beia) ratio below 2.5x.</p><p>Finally, we will Raise the Bar on responsible consumption, environmental and social sustainability and will introduce a renewed ambition for this decade in the coming months. We will also step-up on our people strategy, to be more externally oriented, boost capability building and enhance disciplined entrepreneurship in our operating model.</p><p>Long term value creation</p><p>As we charted this next growth chapter we have made some general assumptions on the recovery.We expect market conditions to gradually improve in the second part of 2021 and to continue improving into 2022, with significant differences across markets and channels. In particular, we see a slow recovery of the on-trade channel in Europe.With EverGreen we aim to create long-term value for all our stakeholders by delivering superior top-line growth, restoring margins and gearing for operating leverage. As we recover from the crisis, we expect to achieve an operating profit margin (beia) of around 17% by 2023 and to continue to drive operating leverage thereafter.</p><p>For more details, please join us for the presentation of EverGreen today during our video webcast.

These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases.</p><p>There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Royal Dutch Shell plc and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements set out in the extracts from the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts included in this announcement, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Royal Dutch Shell plc's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions.</p><p>Shell's operating plan and budgets are established for a three-year period and are updated annually.\u00a0 As society is not expected to reach net-zero emissions in the next three years, Shell's operating plan, budgets and pricing assumptions also do not reflect its Net-Zero emissions targets.\u00a0 Shell's operating plan, budgets and pricing assumptions reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three years.\u00a0 In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plan, budgets and pricing assumptions also to reflect such movement.</p><p>Also, in this announcement, we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its subsidiaries.</p><p>The extracts from the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts included in this announcement may contain references to Royal Dutch Shell plc's website and to the Shell Sustainability Report.

The following is extracted in full and unedited text from the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts:</p><p>The risks discussed below could have a material adverse effect separately, or in combination, on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Accordingly, investors should carefully consider these risks.Further background on each risk is set out in the relevant sections of this Report indicated by way of cross references under each risk factor.</p><p>The Board's responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing our significant risks is discussed in \"Other Regulatory and Statutory Information\" on pages 182-189.</p><p>STRATEGIC RISKS</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>We are exposed to macroeconomic risks including fluctuating prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals.</p><p>The prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Macroeconomic, geopolitical and technological uncertainties can also affect production costs and demand for our products. Government actions may also affect the prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. This could happen, for example, if governments promote the sale of lower-carbon electric vehicles or even prohibit future sales of new diesel or gasoline vehicles, such as the prohibition in the United Kingdom (UK) that is expected to come into force in 2030. Oil and gas prices can also move independently of each other. Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, pandemics such as COVID-19, political instability, conflicts, economic conditions and actions by major oil and gas producing countries. In a low oil and gas price environment, we\u00a0would generate less revenue from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses, and parts of those businesses could become less profitable or incur losses. Low oil and gas prices have also resulted and could continue to result in the debooking of proved oil or gas reserves, if they become uneconomic in this type of price environment. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices, or rising costs, have resulted and could continue to result in projects being delayed or cancelled. Assets have been impaired in the past, (including in 2020), and there could be impairments in the future. Low oil and gas prices could also affect our ability to maintain our long-term capital investment programme and dividend payments. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could adversely affect the financial, fiscal, legal, political and social stability of countries that rely significantly on oil and gas revenue. In a high oil and gas price environment, we could experience sharp increases in costs, and, under some production-sharing contracts, our entitlement to proved reserves would be reduced. Higher prices could also reduce demand for our products, which could result in lower profitability, particularly in our Oil Products and Chemicals business. Higher prices can also lead to more capacity being built, potentially resulting in an oversupply of products that can negatively affect our LNG and Chemicals businesses.</p><p>Accordingly, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Market overview\" on page 38.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate the impact of price volatility. We test the resilience of our projects and other opportunities against a range of prices and costs for crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. We prepare annual strategic and financial plans that test different scenarios and their impact on prices on our businesses and company as a whole. These plans are appraised regularly throughout the year, especially during periods of significant price and demand volatility as experienced in 2020. We also aim to maintain a strong balance sheet to provide resilience against weak market prices.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Our ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial opportunities depends in part on the accuracy of our price assumptions.</p><p>We use a range of oil and gas price assumptions, which we review on a periodic basis. These ranges help us to evaluate the robustness of our capital allocation for our evaluation of projects and commercial opportunities. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>See \"Market overview\" on page 38.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>The range of commodity prices used in our project and portfolio evaluations is subject to a rigorous assessment of short-, medium- and long-term market drivers. These drivers include the extent and pace of the energy transition. \u00a0</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Our ability to achieve our strategic objectives depends on how we react to competitive forces.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>We face competition in all our businesses. In the crude oil, natural gas, Oil Products and Chemicals businesses we seek to differentiate our products, but many of them are competing in commodity-type markets. Accordingly, failure to manage our costs and our operational performance could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. We also compete with state-owned oil and gas entities with access to vast financial resources. State-owned entities could be motivated by political or other factors in making their business decisions. Accordingly, when bidding on new leases or projects, we could find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage because these state-owned entities may not require a competitive return. If we are unable to obtain competitive returns when bidding on new leases or projects, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>See \"Strategy and outlook\" on page 18.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We continually assess the external environment - the markets and the underlying economic, political, social and environmental drivers that shape them - to evaluate changes in competitive forces and business models. We use multiple future scenarios to assess the resilience of our strategy. We maintain business strategies and plans that focus on actions and capabilities to create and sustain competitive advantage.\u00a0</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>If we fail to stay in step with the pace and extent of society's demands with regard to the energy transition to a low-carbon future, we could fail in sustaining and growing our business.</p><p>The pace and extent of the energy transition could pose a risk to Shell if our own transition towards decarbonisation moves at a different speed to society. If we are slower than society, customers may prefer a different supplier which would adversely impact our reputation and demand for our products. If we move much faster than society, we risk investing in technologies, markets or low-carbon products that are unsuccessful because there is limited demand for them. This could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Strategy and outlook\" on page 19 and\u00a0 \"Climate change and energy transition\" on page 94.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We actively monitor societal developments, such as regulation-driven carbon-pricing mechanisms and customer-driven preferences for products. We incorporate these into scenarios which provide insights into how the energy transition may unfold in the medium and long term. These insights and those from various other external scenarios (such as the IPCC Special Report 1.5 \u00b0C) guide us how we set our strategic direction, capital allocation and carbon emission commitments. We have updated our strategy and organisational structure to be more focused on the sectors where our customers operate, in order to make us better able to compete in the current evolving energy landscape.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Rising climate change concerns and the effects of the energy transition have led and could lead to a decrease in demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels. This may also lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, potential litigation, operational restrictions and additional compliance obligations.</p><p>Societal demand for urgent action has increased especially after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5\u00b0C special report of 2018 and the Paris Agreement's goal to keep the rise in global average temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Society's increasing focus on climate change and the effects of the energy transition has created a risk landscape that is changing rapidly in response to a wide range of stakeholder actions at global, local and business levels. The potential impact and likelihood of climate change effects on Shell could vary across different time horizons, depending on the specific components of the risk.</p><p>We expect that a growing share of our GHG emissions will be subject to regulation, resulting in increased compliance costs and operational restrictions. Regulators may seek to limit certain fossil fuel projects or make it more difficult to obtain required permits. Achieving our target to become net zero on all emissions from our operations will result in additional cost. We also expect that actions by customers to reduce their emissions will continue to lower demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels, as will GHG emissions regulation through taxes, fees and/or other incentives. This could be a factor contributing to additional provisions for our assets and result in lower earnings, cancelled projects and potential impairment of certain assets.</p><p>The physical effects of climate change such as, but not limited to, increases in temperature and sea levels and fluctuations in water levels could also adversely affect our operations and supply chains.</p><p>Some groups are putting pressure on certain investors to divest their investments in fossil fuel companies. If this were to continue, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access capital markets. Groups are also putting pressure on commercial and investment banks to stop financing fossil fuel companies. According to press reports, some financial institutions have started to limit their exposure to certain fossil fuel projects. Accordingly, our ability to use financing for these types of future projects may be adversely affected. This could also adversely affect our potential partners' ability to finance their portion of costs, either through equity or debt.</p><p>In some countries, governments, regulators, organisations and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for costs associated with climate change. While we believe these lawsuits to be without merit, losing any of them could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>In summary, rising climate change concerns and effects of the energy transition have led and could lead to a decrease in demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels. If we are unable to find economically viable, publicly acceptable solutions that reduce our GHG emissions and/or GHG intensity for new and existing projects and for the products we sell, we could experience financial penalties or extra costs, delayed or cancelled projects, potential impairments of our assets, additional provisions and/or reduced production and product sales. This could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\u00a0</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>Our response to the evolving risk landscape requires transparency and clarity around our plans and actions to achieve our climate target. We have a climate change risk management structure which is supported by standards, policies and controls, as part of our health, safety, security and environment and social performance (HSSE &amp; SP) control framework. Climate change and risks resulting from GHG emissions are reviewed and managed in accordance with other significant risks through the Board and Executive Committee. We have established several dedicated climate change and GHG-related forums at different levels of the organisation. These forums seek to address, monitor and review climate change issues. Our strategy to assess and manage risks and opportunities resulting from climate change includes considering different time horizons and their relevance to risk identification and business planning.</p><p>Overall, mitigation of the risk is addressed through our strategy to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions, purposefully and profitably. This approach has three components:</p><p>reducing the GHG-emissions intensity of our operations. We expect to reduce our carbon intensity primarily through altering our product mix as customer (Scope 3) emissions represent the largest component of our carbon intensity.\u00a0 Our aim is to achieve this by shifting the focus of our portfolio as we build our power, hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions businesses and activities; demonstrating resilience by adopting the guidance on disclosure by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures; and working towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.</p><p>For further explanations of our climate change governance, risk management, climate ambition and strategy, our portfolio and performance, please refer to the section \"Climate change and energy transition\" on page 94.For further explanations of how we manage the risk of the physical effects of climate change affecting our operations and supply chains, please refer to the risk factor \"The nature of our operations exposes us, and the communities in which we work, to a wide range of health, safety, security and environment risks\".Risk description:</p><p>We seek to execute divestments in pursuing our strategy. We may be unable to divest these assets successfully in line with our strategy.</p><p>We may be unable to divest assets at acceptable prices or within the timeline envisaged because of market conditions or credit risk. This would result in increased pressure on our cash position and potential impairments. In some cases, we have also retained certain liabilities following a divestment. Even in cases where we have not expressly retained certain liabilities, we may still be held liable for past acts, failures to act or liabilities that are different from those foreseen. We may also face liabilities if a purchaser fails to honour their commitments. Accordingly, if any of the above circumstances arise, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Strategy and outlook\" on page 19.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We continually monitor market developments to assess potential divestments in pursuing our strategy. We carefully tailor our sales processes to buyers' perceived expectations so we can deliver the most competitive outcomes. As a general principle, the sales processes are configured so that buyers will acquire the assets including all related liabilities. For some assets, Shell may agree to retain certain liabilities. We monitor these liabilities closely and make appropriate provisions for them.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>We operate in more than 70 countries that have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, laws and regulations. We and our joint arrangements and associates also face the risk of litigation and disputes worldwide.</p><p>Developments in politics, laws and regulations can and do affect our operations. Potential impacts include: forced divestment of assets; expropriation of property; cancellation or forced renegotiation of contract rights; additional taxes including windfall taxes, restrictions on deductions and retroactive tax claims; antitrust claims; changes to trade compliance regulations; price controls; local content requirements; foreign exchange controls; changes to environmental regulations; changes to regulatory interpretations and enforcement; and changes to disclosure requirements. Tensions between nation states can also affect our business. Any\u00a0of these, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\u00a0</p><p>In 2020, many governments ran deficits to deal with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic, there will be uncertain long-term fiscal consequences, with possible subsequent effects on government policies that affect Shell's business interests.</p><p>From time to time, social and political factors play a role in unprecedented and unanticipated judicial outcomes that could adversely affect Shell. Non-compliance with policies and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, litigation and, ultimately, sanctions. Certain governments and regulatory bodies have, in Shell's opinion, exceeded their constitutional authority by: attempting unilaterally to amend or cancel existing agreements or arrangements; failing to honour existing contractual commitments; and seeking to adjudicate disputes between private litigants. Certain governments have also adopted laws and regulations that could potentially conflict with other countries' laws and regulations, potentially subjecting us to both criminal and civil sanctions. Such developments and outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Other regulatory and statutory information\" on page 182.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We continually monitor geopolitical developments and societal issues relevant to our interests. Our Legal and Tax functions are organised globally and support our business lines in ensuring compliance with local laws and fiscal regulations. Our Government Relations department engages with governments in countries where we operate to understand and influence local policies and to advocate Shell's position on topics relevant to our industry. We are prepared to exit a country if we believe we can no longer operate there in accordance with our standards and applicable law, and we have done so in the past.</p><p>OPERATIONAL RISKS.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Our future hydrocarbon production depends on the delivery of large and integrated projects, and our ability to replace proved oil and gas reserves.</p><p>We face numerous challenges in developing capital projects, especially those which are large and integrated. Challenges include: uncertain geology; frontier conditions; the existence and availability of necessary technology and engineering resources; the availability of skilled labour; the existence of transportation infrastructure; project delays; the expiration of licences; delays in obtaining required permits; potential cost overruns; and technical, fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions. These challenges are particularly relevant in certain developing and emerging-market countries, in frontier areas and in deep-water fields, such as off the coast of Mexico. We may fail to assess or manage these and other risks properly. Such potential obstacles could impair our delivery of these projects, our ability to fulfil the full potential value of the project as assessed when the investment was approved, and/or our ability to fulfil related contractual commitments. This could lead to impairments and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>Future oil and gas production will depend on our access to new proved reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments and other owners of proved reserves and acquisitions, and through developing and applying new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields. Failure to replace proved reserves could result in an accelerated decrease of future production, potentially having a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Shell story\" on page 10.</p><p>Oil and gas production available for sale</p><p>[A] Natural gas volumes are converted into oil equivalent using a factor of 5,800 scf per barrel.</p><p>Proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas reserves [A][B] (at December 31)</p><p>[A] We manage our total proved reserves base without distinguishing between proved reserves from subsidiaries and those from joint ventures and associates.[B] Includes proved reserves associated with future production that will be consumed in operations.[C] Natural gas volumes are converted into oil equivalent using a factor of 5,800 scf per barrel.How this risk is managed:</p><p>We continue to explore for and mature hydrocarbons across our Deep Water, Conventional Oil and Gas, Shales and Integrated Gas businesses. We use our subsurface, project and technical expertise, and actively manage non-technical risks across a diversified portfolio of opportunities and projects. This involves adopting an integrated approach for all stages, from basin choice to development. We use competitive techniques and benchmark our approach internally and externally.\u00a0</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements based on available information and the application of complex rules. This means subsequent downward adjustments are possible.</p><p>The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements and determinations based on available geological, technical, contractual and economic information. Estimates can change over time due to new information from production or drilling activities, changes in economic factors, such as oil and gas prices, alterations in the regulatory policies of host governments, or other events. Estimates also change to reflect acquisitions, divestments, new discoveries, extensions of existing fields and mines, and improved recovery techniques. Published proved oil and gas reserves estimates could also be subject to correction because of errors in the application of published rules and changes in guidance. Downward adjustments could indicate lower future production volumes and could also lead to impairment of assets. This could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Supplementary information - oil and gas (unaudited)\" on page 265.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>A central group of reserves experts undertakes the primary assurance of the proved reserves bookings. A multidisciplinary committee reviews and endorses all major proved reserves bookings. Shell's Audit Committee reviews all proved reserves bookings and Shell's Executive Committee is responsible for final approval. The Internal Audit function also provides further assurance through audits of the control framework, including the information disclosed in ''Supplementary information - oil and gas (unaudited).</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>The nature of our operations exposes us, and the communities in which we work, to a wide range of health, safety, security and environment risks.</p><p>The health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) risks to which we and the communities in which we work are potentially exposed cover a wide spectrum, given the geographic range, operational diversity and technical complexity of our operations. These risks include the effects of natural disasters (including weather events), earthquakes, social unrest, pandemic diseases, criminal actions by external parties, and safety lapses. If a major risk materialises, such as an explosion or hydrocarbon leak or spill, this could result in injuries, loss of life, environmental harm, disruption of business activities, loss or suspension of permits, loss of our licence to operate and loss of our ability to bid on mineral rights. Accordingly, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>Our operations are subject to extensive HSSE regulatory requirements that often change and are likely to become more stringent over time. Governments could require operators to adjust their future production plans, as has occurred in the Netherlands, affecting production and costs. We could incur significant extra costs in the future because of the need to comply with such requirements. We could also incur significant extra costs due to violations of or liabilities under laws and regulations that involve elements such as fines, penalties, clean-up costs and third-party claims. Therefore, if HSSE risks materialise, they could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Environment and society\" on page 85.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We have standards and a clear governance structure to help manage HSSE risks and avoid potential adverse effects. The standards and governance structure also help us to develop mitigation strategies aimed at ensuring that if an HSSE risk materialises, we avoid catastrophic consequences and have ways of trying to remediate any environmental damage. Our standards and governance structure are defined in our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE &amp; SP) control framework and supporting guidance documents. The process safety and HSSE &amp; SP assurance team provides assurance on the effectiveness of HSSE &amp; SP controls to the Board. We routinely practise implementing our emergency response plans to significant risks (such as a spill, toxic substances, fire or explosion).</p><p>We have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on activities and we are implementing measures to minimise the adverse effect of the pandemic on our operations. These measures include monitoring the level of infections among staff, ensuring the safety and well-being of all staff, (particularly critical staff who continue to operate our assets), scenario planning, deploying continuity plans and ensuring our sites and offices are \"COVID safe\".</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>A further erosion of the business and operating environment in Nigeria could have a material adverse effect on us.</p><p>In our Nigerian operations, we face various risks and adverse conditions. These include: security issues affecting the safety of our people, host communities and operations; sabotage and theft; our ability to enforce existing contractual rights; litigation; limited infrastructure; potential legislation that could increase our taxes or operating costs; the effect of lower oil and gas prices on the government budget; and regional instability created by militant activities. These risks or adverse conditions could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Upstream\" on page 53.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We test the economic and operational resilience of our Nigerian projects against a wide range of assumptions and scenarios. We seek to proportionally share risks and funding commitments with joint-venture partners. When we participate in joint ventures in Nigeria, we require that they operate to internationally accepted business standards. We monitor the security situation, and liaise with host communities, governmental and non-governmental organisations to help promote peaceful and safe operations.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>An erosion of our business reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand, our ability to secure new resources or access capital markets, and on our licence to operate.</p><p>Our reputation is an important asset. The Shell General Business Principles (Principles) govern how Shell and its individual companies conduct their affairs, and the Shell Code of Conduct tells employees and contract staff how to behave in line with the Principles. Our challenge is to ensure that all employees and contract staff comply with the Principles and the Code of Conduct. Real or perceived failures of governance or regulatory compliance or a perceived lack of understanding of how our operations affect surrounding communities could harm our reputation.</p><p>Societal expectations of businesses are increasing, with a focus on business ethics, quality of products, contribution to society, safety and minimising damage to the environment. There is increasing focus on the role of oil and gas in the context of climate change and energy transition. This could negatively affect our brand, reputation and licence to operate, which could limit our ability to deliver our strategy, reduce consumer demand for our branded and non-branded products, harm our ability to secure new resources and contracts, and restrict our ability to access capital markets or attract staff. Many other factors, including the materialisation of the risks discussed in several of the other risk factors, could negatively affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Other Regulatory and Statutory Information\" on page 182 and \"Our people\" on page 108.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We continually assess and monitor the external environment for potential risks to our reputation. We engage in ongoing dialogue with our key stakeholders such as investors, industry and trade groups, universities, governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to gain greater insights into societal expectations of our business. We have mitigation plans for identified brand and reputation risks at the Group, country and line of business level. Our country chairs are responsible for the implementation of country reputation plans which are updated annually. We continually develop and defend our brand in line with Shell's purpose and promises, and target our investments to drive brand differentiation, relevance and preference.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>We rely heavily on information technology systems in our operations.</p><p>The operation of many of our business processes depends on reliable information technology (IT) systems. Our IT systems are increasingly concentrated in terms of geography and number of systems. They are dependent on key contractors supporting the delivery of IT services. During 2020, information and cyber-security risks developed and changed rapidly. Globally the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have altered the IT threat landscape, increasing the frequency and ingenuity of malware attacks and increasing the temptation to attack targets for financial gain. Also, the prevalence of remote working introduces additional risk because it expands the IT threat landscape. We have experienced breaches and disruptions to our critical IT services in the past. These factors continue to contribute to potential breaches and disruptions of critical IT services. Additionally, breaches can lead to data privacy issues. If the breaches are not detected early and responded to effectively, they could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Corporate\" on page\u00a080.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We continually measure and improve our cyber-security capabilities. To reduce the likelihood of successful cyber-attacks, our cyber-security capabilities are embedded into our IT systems. Our IT is protected by detective and protective technologies. Identification and assessment capabilities are built into our IT support processes and adhere to industry best practices. When external companies provide us with IT services, the security of those services is managed through contractual clauses and supplier assurance reports. Shell invests constantly in efforts to embed and improve our controls and monitoring. For example, we improved our global web content filtering capability in response to the challenge of increased remote working in 2020. If breaches occur, all entities, including ones that have yet to be fully integrated into Shell's systems and processes, are required to report the incident and use Shell's information security capabilities.\u00a0</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Our business exposes us to risks of social instability, criminality, civil unrest, terrorism, piracy, cyber-disruption and acts of war that could have a material adverse effect on our operations.</p><p>As seen in recent years, these risks can manifest themselves in the countries where we operate and elsewhere. These risks affect people and assets. Potential risks include: acts of terrorism; acts of criminality including maritime piracy; cyber-espionage or disruptive cyber-attacks; conflicts including war, civil unrest and environmental and climate activism (including disruptions by non-governmental and political organisations).</p><p>The above risks can threaten the safe operation of our facilities and the transport of our products. They can harm the well-being of our people, inflict loss of life and injuries, damage the environment and disrupt our operational activities. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Environment and society\" on pages 85.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We seek to obtain the best possible information to enable us to assess threats and risks. We conduct detailed assessments for all our sites and activities, and implement appropriate measures to deter, detect and respond to security risks. Further mitigations include strengthening the security of sites, reducing our exposure as appropriate, journey management, information risk management, crisis management and business continuity measures. We conduct training and awareness campaigns for staff and provide them with travel and health advice and access to 24/7 assistance while travelling.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Production from the Groningen field in the Netherlands causes earthquakes that affect local communities.</p><p>Shell and ExxonMobil are 50:50 shareholders in Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM). An important part of NAM's gas production comes from the onshore Groningen gas field, in which EBN, a Dutch government entity, has a 40% interest and NAM a 60% interest. The gas field is in the process of being closed down due to earthquakes induced by gas production. Some of these earthquakes have damaged houses and other structures in the region, resulting in complaints and lawsuits from the local community. The government has announced it intends to accelerate the close-down, bringing the end of production forward from 2030 to possibly mid-2022. The exact shut-in date depends on security of supply considerations and is still to be decided. While we expect the earlier closing down of the Groningen gas field to further reduce the number and strength of earthquakes in the region, any additional earthquakes could have further adverse effects on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Upstream\" on page 53.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>NAM is working with the Dutch government and other stakeholders to fulfil its obligations to residents of the area. These include compensating for damage caused by the earthquakes and paying to strengthen houses where this is required for safety considerations. Negotiations with the state are being conducted to determine how to manage the accelerated close-down. Specific remediations within the agreed scope of responsibilities are planned. NAM's joint-venture partners will review its financial robustness against different scenarios for Groningen's liabilities and costs, with the aim of the venture being able to self-fund any additional expenses and claims.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>We are exposed to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk. We are affected by the global macroeconomic environment and the conditions of financial and commodity markets.</p><p>Our subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are subject to differing economic and financial market conditions around the world. Political or economic instability affects such markets.</p><p>We use debt instruments, such as bonds and commercial paper, to raise significant amounts of capital. Should our access to debt markets become more difficult, the potential impact on our liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our financing costs could also be affected by interest rate fluctuations or any credit rating deterioration.</p><p>We are exposed to changes in currency values and to exchange controls as a result of our substantial international operations. Our reporting currency is the US dollar, although, to a material extent, we also hold assets and are exposed to liabilities in other currencies. While we undertake some foreign exchange hedging, we do not do so for all our activities. Even\u00a0where hedging is in place, it may not function as expected.</p><p>We are exposed to credit risk; our counterparties could fail or be unable to meet their payment and/or performance obligations under contractual arrangements. Although we do not have significant direct exposure to sovereign debt, it is possible that our partners and customers may have exposure which could impair their ability to meet their obligations. Our pension plans invest in government bonds, and could therefore be affected by a sovereign debt downgrade or other default.</p><p>If any of the above risks materialise, they could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Liquidity and capital resources\" on page 81 and Note 19 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on pages 251-255.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We use various financial instruments for managing exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements.\u00a0Our treasury operations are highly centralised and seek to manage credit exposures associated with our substantial cash, foreign exchange and interest rate positions.\u00a0Our portfolio of cash investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one instrument, country or counterparty. Other than in exceptional cases, the use of external derivative instruments is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that have the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems. We have credit risk policies in place which seek to ensure that products are sold to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. These policies include detailed credit analysis and monitoring of customers against counterparty credit limits.\u00a0Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments and collateral are used to manage credit risk. We maintain committed credit facilities. Management believes it has access to sufficient debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable requirements.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Our future performance depends on the successful development and deployment of new technologies and new products.</p><p>Technology and innovation are essential to our efforts to meet the world's energy demands competitively. If we fail to continue developing or deploying technology and new products, or fail to make full, effective use of our data in a timely and cost-effective manner, there could be a material adverse effect on the delivery of our strategy and our licence to operate. We operate in environments where advanced technologies are used. In developing new technologies and new products, unknown or unforeseeable technological failures or environmental and health effects could harm our reputation and licence to operate or expose us to litigation or sanctions. The associated costs of new technology are sometimes underestimated. Sometimes the development of new technology is subject to delays. If we are unable to develop the right technology and products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we develop technologies and products that harm the environment or people's health, there could be a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Shell story\" on page 10.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>Shell's Technology organisation and the relevant business lines work together to determine the content, scope and budget for developing new technology that supports our activities. The new technology is developed to ensure portfolio alignment with Shell's strategic ambitions and deployment commitments. A significant proportion of Shell's technology contributes to Shell's New Energies portfolio and Net Carbon Footprint target, and is built around key relationships with leading academic research institutes and universities. We also benefit from working with start-ups. In our Shell GameChanger programme, we help companies to mature early-stage technologies. In our Shell Ventures scheme, we invest in and partner with start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises that are in the early stages of developing new technologies.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>We have substantial pension commitments, the funding of which is subject to capital market risks and other factors.</p><p>Liabilities associated with defined benefit pension plans are significant, and the cash funding requirement of such plans can also involve significant liabilities. They both depend on various assumptions. Volatility in capital markets or government policies could affect investment performance and interest rates, causing significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. Changes in assumptions for mortality, retirement age or pensionable remuneration at retirement could also cause significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. We operate a number of defined benefit pension plans and, in case of a shortfall, we could be required to make substantial cash contributions (depending on the applicable local regulations). This could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Liquidity and capital resources\" on page 81.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>A pensions forum chaired by the Chief Financial Officer oversees Shell's input to pension strategy, policy and operation. A risk committee supports the forum in reviewing the results of assurance processes with respect to pension risks. Local trustees manage the funded defined benefit pension plans, and the contributions paid are based on independent actuarial valuations that align with local regulations.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>We mainly self-insure our risk exposure. We could incur significant losses from different types of risks that are not covered by insurance from third-party insurers.</p><p>Our insurance subsidiaries provide hazard insurance coverage to other Shell entities, who may insure a portion of their risk exposures with third parties. Such insurance would not provide any material coverage in the event of a large-scale safety or environmental incident. Accordingly, in the event of a material incident, we would have to meet our obligations without access to material proceeds from third-party insurance companies. Therefore, we may incur significant losses from different types of risks that are not covered by insurance from third-party insurers, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Corporate\" on page 80.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We continually assess the safety performance of our operations and make risk mitigation recommendations, where relevant, to keep the risk of an accident as low as possible. Our insurance subsidiaries are adequately capitalised and they may transfer risks to third-party insurers where economical, effective and relevant.\u00a0</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Many of our major projects and operations are conducted in joint arrangements or with associates. This could reduce our degree of control and our ability to identify and manage risks.</p><p>When we are not the operator, we have less influence and control over the behaviour, performance and operating costs of joint arrangements or associates. Despite having less control, we could still be exposed to the risks associated with these operations, including reputational, litigation (where joint and several liability could apply) and government sanction risks. For example, our partners or members of a joint arrangement or an associate, (particularly local partners in developing countries), may be unable to meet their financial or other obligations to projects, threatening the viability of a given project. Where we are the operator of a joint arrangement, the other partner(s) could still be able to veto or block certain decisions, which could be to our overall detriment. Accordingly, where we have limited influence, we are exposed to operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Other Regulatory and Statutory Information\" on page 182.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>Shell appoints a Joint Venture Asset Manager, whose responsibility is to manage performance and create and protect value for Shell. The Joint Venture Asset Manager seeks to influence operators and other partners to adapt their practices in order to drive value appropriately and to mitigate identified risks. An annual assurance review assesses how the joint venture's standards and processes align with those of Shell. The Joint Venture Asset Manager follows up on any gaps identified.</p><p>CONDUCT RISKS</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>We are exposed to commodity trading risks, including market and operational risks.</p><p>Commodity trading is an important component of our Upstream, Integrated Gas, Oil Products and Chemicals businesses and is integrated with our supply business. Processing, managing and monitoring many trading transactions across the world, some of them complex, exposes us to operational and market risks, including commodity price risks which saw significant levels of volatility in 2020. We use derivative instruments such as futures and contracts for differences to hedge market risks. We do not hedge all our activities and where hedging is in place, it may not function as expected. The risk of ineffective controls and oversight of trading activities, and the risk that traders could deliberately act outside limits and controls, either individually or as a group, could have material adverse effects on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Liquidity and capital resources\" on page 81 and Note 19 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on pages 251-255.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>In effecting commodity trades and derivative contracts, the company operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks are managed within authorised limits.\u00a0For example, the use of external derivative instruments is confined to specialist trading organisations that have the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems. Our trading organisation has a compliance manual addressing our operational risks which all staff are required to follow. Senior Management regularly reviews mandated trading limits. We monitor market risk exposure daily, using value-at-risk (VAR) techniques. We monitor trading positions against limits every day. We use marking to fair value to assess trading exposures where appropriate, with a department that is independent of the traders reviewing the market values applied. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, trader monitoring tools have been upgraded. During the period of extreme market volatility, additional oversight has been provided by a dedicated 'Liquidity Forum', chaired by senior executives in our trading organisation.\u00a0 We have increased the monitoring of the financial resilience of our customers, suppliers and the clearing houses that we deal with.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Violations of antitrust and competition laws carry fines and expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits.</p><p>Antitrust and competition laws apply to Shell and its joint arrangements and associates in the vast majority of countries where we do business. Shell and its joint arrangements and associates have been fined for violations of antitrust and competition laws in the past. This includes a number of fines by\u00a0the European Commission Directorate-General for Competition (DG\u00a0COMP). Because of DG COMP's fining guidelines, any future conviction of Shell or any of its joint arrangements or associates for violation of EU competition law could potentially result in significantly larger fines and have a material adverse effect on us. Violation of antitrust laws is a criminal offence in many countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. In certain circumstances, directors may receive director disqualification orders. It is also now common for persons or corporations allegedly injured by antitrust violations to sue for damages. Any violation of these laws can harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Other Regulatory and Statutory Information\" on pages 182.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We maintain an antitrust programme with adequate resources, a comprehensive governance structure and established reporting lines. Staff receive clear guidance that includes requirements in Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual, an antitrust-specific website, training modules where completion is monitored and regular messages from Shell leaders on the importance of managing antitrust risks. Staff must understand and comply with the \"Protect Shell Policy\", which explains Shell's position on managing antitrust risks in engagements with parties external to Shell. As result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have issued guidance to address antitrust risks arising from the disruption to supply chains, including procurement guidance which outlines the risks associated with exchanging information and collaborating with Shell's procurement competitors.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Violations of anti-bribery, tax-evasion and anti-money laundering laws carry fines and expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions, civil suits and ancillary consequences (such as debarment and the revocation of licences).</p><p>Anti-bribery, tax-evasion and anti-money laundering laws apply to Shell, its joint arrangements and associates in all countries where we do business. Shell and its joint arrangements and associates have in the past settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission regarding violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any violation of anti-bribery, tax-evasion or anti-money laundering laws, including those potential violations associated with Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited's investment in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 and the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block, could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Our people\" on pages 108, \"Other Regulatory and Statutory Information\" on page 182 and Note 25 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on pages 260.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We maintain an anti-bribery and anti-money-laundering (ABC/AML) programme with adequate resources, a comprehensive governance structure and established reporting lines. Staff receive clear guidance which includes requirements in Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual, an ABC/AML-specific website, training modules where completion is monitored and regular messages from Shell leaders on the importance of managing ABC/AML risks. As regards OPL 245, the 2011 settlement was a fully legal transaction with Eni and the Federal Government of Nigeria, represented by the most senior officials of the relevant ministries. We maintain our view that there is no basis to convict Shell, or any of our former employees who are also on trial in Milan. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have set up fast-track processes to deal with relief donation requests. These processes include counterparty due diligence and are supported by Shell's Ethics and Compliance Office.</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Violations of data protection laws carry fines and expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits.</p><p>Data protection laws apply to Shell and its joint arrangements and associates in the vast majority of countries where we do business. Most of the countries we operate in have data protection laws and regulations. In some countries that are key to Shell's business operations, legislation continues to be amended or introduced. Shell must be able to adapt dynamically to such legislative changes and be capable of updating our internal programmes if necessary. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in May 2018, imposed increased financial penalties of up to a maximum of 4% of global annual turnover. It requires mandatory breach notification in certain situations, the standard which is also followed outside the EU (particularly in Asia). Non-compliance with data protection laws could expose us to regulatory investigations, which could result in fines, penalties and harm to our reputation. With regard to data breaches, we have breached the GDPR in the past and some investigations are still ongoing with European regulators. To date, no material fines have been imposed, but no assurance can be provided that future breaches would have similar outcomes. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. We could also be subject to litigation from persons or entities allegedly affected by data protection violations.With data privacy legislation now in force in the USA, the risk of class actions is increased. Class actions after large-scale data breaches are increasingly common in the UK.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the level of processing of personal data to track employees, suppliers or other visitors to our premises. Some governments require immediate disclosure of information, including sensitive personal data, to identify infected individuals, with some mandating technologies such as tracing applications on all devices, including corporate mobile phones.</p><p>Violation of data protection laws is a criminal offence in some countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. Any violation of these laws or harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.</p><p>See \"Other Regulatory and Statutory Information\" on page 182.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We maintain a data privacy programme with adequate resources, a comprehensive governance structure and established reporting lines. Shell has had Binding Corporate Rules in place for the last 10 years. These rules are part of a group wide global programme to ensure consistent levels of data protection across the group. Staff receive clear guidance which includes requirements in Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual, a website focusing on data privacy, training modules where completion is monitored, and regular messages from Shell leaders on the importance of managing data privacy risks.We have revised the requirements for incident management that are set out in our Binding Corporate Rules, in order to comply with GDPR reporting requirements. We have revised our approach to privacy impact assessments, also to comply with GDPR reporting requirements. We use our Privacy by Design programme to enhance our controls in this area. We continue to address challenges with compliance in data-heavy companies controlled by Shell but not fully integrated into our systems. IT remediation work remains a priority in such companies, as does the strengthening of programmes to support data privacy compliance.</p><p>To respond to the increased risk resulting from the pandemic, we have developed policies on temperature screening and published a guidance note on \"Privacy Best Practices for COVID-19\".</p><p>Risk description:</p><p>Violations of trade compliance laws and regulations, including sanctions, carry fines and expose us and our employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits.</p><p>We use \"trade compliance\" as an umbrella term for various national and international laws designed to regulate the movement of items across national boundaries and restrict or prohibit trade and other dealings with certain parties. The number and breadth of such laws continue to expand. For example, the EU and the USA continue to impose restrictions and prohibitions on certain transactions involving countries such as Syria, Venezuela, Russia and Cuba. The USA continues to impose comprehensive sanctions against Iran, while the EU and other nations continue to maintain targeted sanctions. The EU and the USA imposed restrictions and controls on defined oil and gas activities in Russia in 2014, and these remain in force. The USA introduced further restrictions regarding Russia in 2017, expanding them in 2018. The EU and the USA introduced sectoral sanctions against Venezuela in 2017, with the USA expanding them in 2018 and 2019. The US sanctions primarily target the government of Venezuela and the oil industry. Many other nations are also adopting trade-control programmes similar to those administered by the EU and the USA. The expansion of sanctions, the frequent additions of prohibited parties, the number of markets in which we operate and the large number of transactions we process, make compliance with all sanctions complex and sometimes challenging. Shell has voluntarily self-disclosed potential violations of sanctions in the past. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased trade compliance risks, due to factors such as growing state involvement in business dealings, the need to maintain and develop business opportunities and cross-border movement of goods and technologies, and the increasing likelihood that counterparties will change ownership as the economic crisis continues.</p><p>Any violation of sanctions could lead to loss of import or export privileges and significant penalties on or prosecution of Shell or its employees. This could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition</p><p>See \"Other Regulatory and Statutory Information\" on page 182.</p><p>How this risk is managed:</p><p>We continue to develop and maintain a trade compliance programme with adequate resources, a comprehensive governance structure and established reporting lines. Staff receive clear guidance, which includes requirements in Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual, a specific website for trade compliance, training modules where completion is monitored and regular messages from Shell leaders on the importance of managing trade compliance risks. The effectiveness of the trade compliance programme is assessed annually (or more frequently if necessary). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have promoted an increased focus on compliance and assurance. For example, in Trading and Supply we have promoted a particular focus on compliance with trade controls in high-risk areas such as port agency, inspections and terminal operations.</p><p>Investors should also consider the following, which could limit shareholder remedies.</p><p>The Company's Articles of Association determine the jurisdiction for shareholder disputes. This could limit shareholder remedies.</p><p>Our Articles of Association generally require that all disputes between our shareholders in such capacity and the Company or our subsidiaries (or our Directors or former Directors), or between the Company and our Directors or former Directors, be exclusively resolved by arbitration in The Hague, the Netherlands, under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Our Articles of Association also provide that, if this provision is to be determined invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the dispute could only be brought before the courts of England and Wales. Accordingly, the ability of shareholders to obtain monetary or other relief, including in respect of securities law claims, could be determined in accordance with these provisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS</emphasis></p><p>Disclosures in relation to the related party transactions are set out on page 185 of the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts.

Nor were there any transactions with any related party that were unusual in their nature or conditions.</p><p>On February 27, 2020 the fully-consolidated Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. (SHLX) signed an agreement with its Shell-controlled general partner to eliminate all incentive distribution rights and economic general partner interest in SHLX and convert the general partner's two per cent general partner interest in SHLX into a non-economic general partner interest in SHLX. SHLX also entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Shell affiliates to acquire our 79% interest in the Mattox Pipeline Company LLC, which owns the Mattox Pipeline, and certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex. Both transactions completed on April 1, 2020. As consideration for the assets and the elimination of incentive distribution rights, Shell received 160 million newly issued SHLX common units, plus $1.2 billion of Series A perpetual convertible preferred units at a price of $23.63 per unit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS</emphasis></p><p>The following statement is extracted in full and is unedited text from page 189 of the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts.</p><p>The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. These require the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. As such, the Directors have prepared the (i) Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, and therefore in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union; and (ii) Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Shell and the Company and of the profit or loss of Shell and the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:</p><p>adopt the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to do so;select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; andstate whether international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB have been followed.</p><p>The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of Shell and the Company and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of Shell and the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and, as regards the Consolidated Financial Statements, with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and therefore are in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.

This approach has three components:reducing the GHG-emissions intensity of our operations. We expect to reduce our carbon intensity primarily through altering our product mix as customer (Scope 3) emissions represent the largest component of our carbon intensity. Our aim is to achieve this by shifting the focus of our portfolio as we build our power, hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions businesses and activities; demonstrating resilience by adopting the guidance on disclosure by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures; and working towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.

Development does not exist without water.  Without water, ecosystems and people suffer and development stalls. Without healthy ecosystems, water degrades and development brings risks and insecurity. For development to prosper and flourish, water and ecosystems need to be given the chance to do the same\", says James Dalton, Director of the IUCN Global Water Programme.</p><p>World Water Week offers an international platform for government, business, and science to convene and address the many challenges posed to our planet's dwindling and degrading water resources. Earlier this year, the UN focused on nature-based solutions as the theme for the 2018 World Water Development Report. IUCN pioneered nature-based solutions over a decade ago and continues to implement them widely on the ground.</p><p>Nature-based solutions represent our reliance on natural systems. We rely on the natural properties, distribution, and functioning of our natural ecosystems and biodiversity that provide us with freshwater.  Mangroves naturally protect coastlines, provide habitat, and store carbon.  Floodplains have shaped our landscapes for millions of years, providing fertile land for agriculture and habitat for biodiversity and human livelihoods.  Wetlands help to slow down floodwaters, distribute nutrients and improve water quality.</p><p>If we safeguard nature's health, and therefore performance, we could save billions in water services that are provided by nature based solutions, and also help avoid loss of human life caused by large-scale disasters and conflict.</p><p>Now in the second year of implementation, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) address water challenges through SDG 6, specifically target 6: \"by 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes\". Considering the UN Biodiversity Conference will take place in late 2018, the biodiversity dimension of ecosystem development and water resource management will be given special attention in Stockholm by the IUCN Water Programme.</p><p>A new Alliance for Freshwater Life (AFL) will be launched at WWW, a global collaboration to halt and reverse the decline of freshwater biodiversity. The AFL is an interdisciplinary network which will work to improve the conservation and sustainable use of freshwater ecosystems and the biodiversity therein. During another special session, the results of five years implementation of IUCN's Partnership for Environmental Governance in West Africa (PAGE) will be presented. The PAGE programme was implemented in West Africa, specifically in the Volta, Niger, Senegal and Mono river basins.</p><p>One of IUCN's key sessions at WWW \"Water, Biodiversity &amp; Development: a magic formula for the SDGs\" will address answers which swirl and resurface in many international debates. How do we steer national SDG planning debates to recognize that the SDGs are indivisible? Can conservation be better articulated - by the water and biodiversity communities alike - as a key development issue? In the end SDGs related to life on land, biodiversity, water, and oceans, underpin the stability of the planet, and that of current and future human development.</p><p>IUCN will equally address one of the greater policy challenges of our time: how to prioritise different river basin benefits and functions given limited water resources?  The session \"Efficiency, sufficiency, sustainability: allocation in river basins\" will look at policy challenges and public and private responses to improve water allocation that includes ecosystem and development needs. Taking this into the international realm, IUCN will focus on transboundary water management, and what mechanisms have moved beyond the state diplomatic offices to share water among diverse sets of stakeholders while balancing development and conservation goals (Session: Share, Conserve, Develop! How do we do it all in Transboundary Basins?).</p><p>Water challenges are global in scope, but hit women and the world's poor hardest, as the lack of sufficient, clean, affordable water impacts health and wellbeing. IUCN, along with the Women for Water Partnership, Oxfam, and SaciWATERs will release a new publication titled \"Women as Change-makers in the Governance of Shared Waters\". Issues of gender equality in transboundary water governance have received little explicit attention to date in policy literature, but action is happening on the ground. \"With improved recognition and understanding of the roles women fulfil as agents of change in the governance of shared waters governance, there is potential to accelerate transformations that will lead to a more sustainable resource for humans and nature\", says Isabelle Fauconnier, IUCN Water Policy and Governance Coordinator.</p>", "publisher": "NEWS Press (English)", "instances": ["Development does not exist without water.

It is good to see more people talking about the need for urgent action.</p><p>But far too many, including those in Africa, overlook two essential ingredients: nature and youth. This duo cannot be ignored in the search for solutions to our planetary crises.</p><p>In my home country of Kenya, there is simply no way we can achieve our national target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 without addressing deforestation and land degradation-which remain the largest source of emissions here.</p><p>Deforestation has long been a problem. When Kenya gained independence in 1963, 10% of the country was covered in forest. By 2009, this number had dropped to 6% as a result of charcoal and timber production, agriculture expansion, unregulated logging and urbanisation. Not only has this increased our contribution to climate change, it has had a number of other devastating impacts, including soil erosion, increased flooding and dramatically reduced availability of fresh water during droughts.</p><p>Water towers under threat</p><p>Kenya\u2019s five montane forests - called \u201cwater towers\u201d because of their ability to store water during the rainy season and release it slowly during dry periods - provide 75% of our fresh water supplies.</p><p>The United Nations Environment Programme estimated that between 2000 and 2010 more than 28,000 hectares of forest was lost from these water towers, \u201cleading to reduced water availability of approximately 62 million cubic metres per year\u201d. The resulting costs to our economy far exceeded the financial gains from forestry and logging during that same period by a ratio of four to one.</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, the government at the time began to wake up to the problem and made a constitutional commitment to replenish the country\u2019s forests back to 10% of surface area by 2030, which is equivalent to more than 1.6 million hectares of reforestation. Sadly, though, initial efforts were hampered by illegal logging, land disputes, and political infighting.</p><p>The good news is there are signs of progress, including new government-led initiatives. For example, the government has moved forward its deadline for the 10% target to 2022 and has created an enabling a legal framework to achieve it. On top of that, it has committed to restoring 5.1 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes by 2030 as its contribution to the African Forest and Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100), a pan-African, country-led effort to restore 100 million hectares of deforested and degraded landscapes.</p><p>But the simple fact is that we are not making nearly enough concrete progress given the massive scale and urgency of the threat. Yes, the challenges Kenya is facing on this front are very real. For example, the government has estimated the total cost of implementing the 2022 target to be around $430 million over four years, requiring a mix of public and private financing that has not yet emerged. And access to a sustainable supply of high-quality tree seedlings is also proving problematic seeing as the effort is estimated to require 1.8 billion of them.</p><p>But there is no time for excuses; we need to dramatically pick up the pace of our efforts. While there is no single solution, one way to take immediate action is by mobilising our young people to become champions for nature. This certainly isn\u2019t a new idea and there have been youth climate groups in Kenya and the region doing great work for a number of years.</p><p>However, 2019 has seen the rise of a global youth movement for climate action on a scale never seen before; and this movement has spread to Africa, which has the youngest population in the world. The scale, energy and momentum of this movement creates new opportunities that simply didn\u2019t exist before.</p><p>This growing movement of young people are passionate about their futures, motivated and eager to learn. We have the energy and the drive to take action. But, in most cases, we don\u2019t have the information or the know how. That\u2019s why any serious effort to harness the power of this youth movement and transform it into a force for change must begin with education, both as part of formal school curriculums, as well as through initiatives like Youth4Nature. In order for youth to be stewards of nature-based solutions in climate action, we need spaces and resources to strengthen our understanding of what they are and how youth can get involved.</p><p>For example, we need to scale up projects like Green Treasures Farms, a Kenyan youth initiative that teaches women and young people in rural Kenya organic farming skills and how and where to plant trees. The project has been running for five years and has had a real impact on local communities by teaching them how environmental concerns and sustainable agriculture go hand-in-hand.</p><p>Broadly speaking, there are a number of ways that young people can help make a real impact. On the one hand, we can use our power as advocates within our families, schools, and communities to educate and empower others. And on the other, we can hold our political leaders to account. We must ensure that our leaders continue to push for more action to protect and restore nature.

Soil holds more carbon dioxide than all forests and the atmosphere combined. Overexploitation and erosion, however, release large amounts of CO2 from soil.

A dedicated technical assistance programme is currently being rolled out that will ensure that HBOR can better identify natural capital projects with the greatest environmental impact and improve preparation of individual schemes by local businesses and public bodies.</p><p>HBOR is the first intermediary to benefit from both financing and technical preparations supported by the Natural Capital Financing Facility. This reflects Croatia's rich biodiversity and crucial role in nature conservation as one of the most diverse locations for plant diversity anywhere in Europe. 34% of nature areas in the country are protected under Natura 2000.</p><p>Croatian companies expected to benefit from new financing include firms engaged in sustainable agriculture, commercial forestry operations and tourism.</p><p>Supporting conservation and local companies in 30 projects across Europe</p><p>The diverse scope of green investment and nature-based projects that can be supported under the Natural Capital Financing Facility has been highlighted by support for 30 different schemes in partnership with Rewilding Europe Capital (REC), Europe's first dedicated financier of conservation and rewilding enterprises.</p><p>New investment in a diverse range of projects, including flood protection, rainwater recycling, programs to protect forests and reduce water and soil pollution, biodiversity offsets, and eco-tourism have demonstrated the potential for long-term investment by private and public partners in schemes traditionally perceived as too challenging to be commercially viable.</p><p>Promoting dedicated investment in nature based solutions in urban areas</p><p>Financing backed by the Natural Capital Financing Facility is not restricted to rural regions.

(CITES) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), working closely together to facilitate the global celebration of next year's United Nations World Wildlife Day (3 March), announced today the theme of World Wildlife Day 2019: \"Life below water: for people and planet\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">World Wildlife Day 2019 aligns closely with UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 - Life below water, which focuses on marine species, and will be a chance to highlight the crucial importance and value of marine wildlife to our everyday lives, to celebrate successful initiatives to conserve and sustainably manage these species and to scale up support for such initiatives.</p><p>Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UN Assistant Secretary General and Director of UNDP's Bureau for Policy and Programme notes, \"Oceans regulate our climate, produce half the oxygen we breathe, provide nourishment for 3+ billion people, and absorb 30% of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere and fully 90% of the heat from climate change. To ensure that oceans and marine species are preserved and protected, nature-based solutions that bring together public, private and civil society partners need to be replicated and scaled-up.\" </p><p>David Morgan, Officer-in-Charge of the CITES Secretariat, said: \"All whales and dolphins, all marine turtles, all seahorses, many coral species, and more and more shark species have been put under the protection by CITES - the world's wildlife trade regulator. For marine species, CITES is at the interface between sustainable use and international trade for fisheries, working to ensure that trade in marine species listed under the Convention is legal, sustainable and traceable. CITES plays a well-targeted role in advancing implementation of SDG 14 with trade-related measures combined with effective compliance procedures.\"</p><p>World Wildlife Day 2019 will be marked by a series of events and media activities around the world, including a high-level event at UN Headquarters in New York on 1 March (Friday). As part of these activities, CITES and UNDP are also partnering with the Jackson Hole WILD to organize an international film showcase focusing on marine species - \"Living Oceans Film Showcase\".

World Wildlife Day 2019 aligns closely with UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 - Life below water, which focuses on marine species, and will be a chance to highlight the crucial importance and value of marine wildlife to our everyday lives, to celebrate successful initiatives to conserve and sustainably manage these species and to scale up support for such initiatives. Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UN Assistant Secretary General and Director of UNDP's Bureau for Policy and Programme notes, \"Oceans regulate our climate, produce half the oxygen we breathe, provide nourishment for 3+ billion people, and absorb 30% of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere and fully 90% of the heat from climate change. To ensure that oceans and marine species are preserved and protected, nature-based solutions that bring together public, private and civil society partners need to be replicated and scaled-up. David Morgan, Officer-in-Charge of the CITES Secretariat, said: \"All whales and dolphins, all marine turtles, all seahorses, many coral species, and more and more shark species have been put under the protection by CITES - the world's wildlife trade regulator. For marine species, CITES is at the interface between sustainable use and international trade for fisheries, working to ensure that trade in marine species listed under the Convention is legal, sustainable and traceable. CITES plays a well-targeted role in advancing implementation of SDG 14 with trade-related measures combined with effective compliance procedures. World Wildlife Day 2019 will be marked by a series of events and media activities around the world, including a high-level event at UN Headquarters in New York on 1 March (Friday). As part of these activities, CITES and UNDP are also partnering with the Jackson Hole WILD to organize an international film showcase focusing on marine species - \"Living Oceans Film Showcase\"."]}, {"relevance_score": 20, "title": "Solving the climate change crisis naturally", "published": "2011-12-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newspress.fr/common/getImageEm.ashx?imid=2170&amp;amp;emid=3498\">http://www.newspress.fr/common/getImageEm.ashx?imid=2170&amp;amp;emid=3498</url>IUCN calls on policy-makers to increase climate funding and promote nature-based solutions to climate change.</p><p>Among the key issues for IUCN are\u00a0ecosystem-based adaptation to harmful climate change impacts and global implementation of a mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD).<br/> \u00b7 Nature provides a solution to climate change adaptation. \"Ecosystem- based adaptation is a cost effective, no-regrets solution that governments ought to incorporate proactively into national policies and take immediate action to implement on the ground,\" says Stewart Maginnis, Director of IUCN's Environment and Development Group. \"Improving the management of river systems, coral reefs, mangroves and forests all tangibly improve the resilience of neighboring communities to deal with both the sudden and long-term consequences of climate change.\"<br/><br/> \u00b7 Major initiative needs to be taken to promote the development and implementation of an environmentally sound and equitable REDD+ mechanism at a national level. \"A tool that both conserves and restores forest resources and reduces greenhouse gas emissions is one of the few tools we have immediately available to assuage the impacts of climate change,\" says Claire Parker, IUCN's Senior Climate Change Policy Adviser.<br/> \u00a0<br/> \"In order to be effective, however, implementation needs to take place at national level, and include consideration of issues such as a fair distribution of benefits, and allowing equal participation of all stakeholders, including women and indigenous peoples.\"<br/><br/> \u00b7 Governments must recognize the importance of coastal ecosystem management. \"People often don't realize just how effective nature can be in tackling the effects of climate change,\" says Edmund Barrow, IUCN Head of Ecosystem Management Programme. \"The challenge is to find the most appropriate and sustainable ways to make use of it.

IUCN's latest research now shows that in restoring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2020 - which is only 15% of the estimated area of degraded forests worldwide - we would see more than US$ 84 billion net injected annually into local and global economies and cut the climate change \"emissions reduction gap\" by 11-17%. says Stewart Maginnis, Director, of the Nature-Based Solutions Group of IUCN. \"It will make significant contributions to the global challenges we face today, alleviating poverty, slowing global warming and securing food, particularly for those who need it most. The campaign is calling on individuals around the world to Plant a Pledge of support through the campaign website - which will become a global petition to be delivered at the UN climate change talks in Qatar, later this year. Each online pledge asks governments, private landowners and communities who manage lands to commit areas for restoration in order to achieve the Bonn Challenge by 2020. The Global Partnership for Forest Landscape Restoration (GPFLR), who along with the German government hosted the original Bonn Challenge meeting, recently identified two billion hectares of land worldwide - an area the size of South America - as offering opportunities for forest landscape restoration. Repairing landscapes would restore their ability to support people and wildlife and would significantly increase global capacity to process greenhouse gases, according to IUCN."]}, {"relevance_score": 24, "title": "Strengthening IUCN in Europe", "published": "2012-12-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Editorial: Strengthening IUCN in Europe<br/>Dear Members, partners and friends,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At 64 years of age, and in the midst of global economic and environmental crises, IUCN wants more than ever to be at the forefront of natural solutions for our future and well-being. In Europe, like everywhere else in the world, IUCN is the leading authority on conserving nature and natural resources for people's livelihoods, setting standards and fostering policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To fulfill its mission and role, IUCN needs to be efficient in its use of resources. In light of recent decreases in funding for biodiversity worldwide, I have had to review our operations and restructure some of our units to make the best use of the resources available.</p><p>The IUCN European region, comprising West and East Europe, North and Central Asia, as well as the numerous European overseas entities, includes a very diverse group of IUCN Members and National Committees. The structure of our Secretariat needs to be adapted to better reflect this diversity and to complement their work.</p><p>In support of the existing European Secretariat functions, I have decided to share the responsibility for the Secretariat's support to our 403 European Members among the specialized units of IUCN's Headquarters. I have appointed Sebasti\u00e0 Semene Guitart, an existing staff member based in Gland, as Senior Coordinator, Europe and Union Development Planning, to take on the tasks of representation and general coordination for our European activities. Sebasti\u00e0 will be identifying, initiating and facilitating opportunities for substantive collaboration with European National Committees and Members in order to consolidate a European Programme that fully reflects the diverse nature and interests of IUCN's constituents in Europe. He will work in close cooperation with the European Secretariat staff in the IUCN Offices in Belgrade, Brussels, Gland, Malaga, and Tbilisi with the purpose of enhancing the work of IUCN in the region.</p><p>This is a new way of ensuring the One Programme approach which, as you know, aims to foster cooperation across the IUCN constituency. This builds on the strength in diversity of the IUCN network and finds operational approaches to enhancing collaboration.</p><p>To underline the importance of IUCN's role in Brussels, we are in the process of recruiting a Director specializing in policy-influencing and fundraising to be based in IUCN's office in Brussels. The European Union is a major global policy player and the largest development aid donor in the world. Being in Brussels is crucial for achieving our goals of influencing policies, not only for conservation action in the European region itself but also in European overseas entities, which harbor 70% of Europe's biodiversity, and worldwide. The new Director in Brussels will promote IUCN's science and knowledge to feed into EU policy-making and the implementation of nature-based solutions.</p><p>The positions of Regional Director for Europe and Head of Brussels office have been abolished and their functions will be replaced by the two newly created roles.</p><p>The new structure in Europe will lay the foundations for the development and implementation of the IUCN Union Development Plan. The Plan will increase IUCN's relevance and visibility and it will help manage the expectations of our various constituents and set clear rules for collaboration for the implementation of the IUCN Programme and support delivery on the ground.</p><p>With this ambition in mind, I have organized a meeting with the European National Committees in Copenhagen in early January to listen to their ideas and together shape the future of the European region in line with the Union Development Plan. In addition, we plan to engage more directly with IUCN's State Members in all regions, starting with a meeting with European State Members in mid-January 2013, ahead of the meeting of the new IUCN Council in late January 2013.</p><p>Europe is the largest programmatic region of IUCN and contains a third of our global membership. We will be able to achieve our goal of making this world a better place for nature and people only if Secretariat, Members, Committees and also Commissions work together.</p><p>I thank you, once again, for your continuous and valuable support to IUCN, and look forward to our continued good collaboration.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Julia Marton Lef\u00e8vre<br/>IUCN Director General</p>", "publisher": "NEWS Press (English)", "instances": ["This is a new way of ensuring the One Programme approach which, as you know, aims to foster cooperation across the IUCN constituency.

In addition, the combined waters of the EU and its overseas entities make up the world's largest marine domain, with areas located in every ocean. The Message calls for a political vision on protecting maritime areas, which is still missing despite the international importance of this marine domain for ocean governance.</p><p>The French Minister for Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, committed France to a number of concrete actions to counter biodiversity loss in its overseas entities: France will put in place an access and benefit-sharing framework, foster the protection of key ecosystems such as mangroves and coral reefs, and support the creation of new wetlands and marine protected areas in Martinique, French Guiana and French Polynesia in order to meet the ambitious national target of protecting 20% of its seas by 2020.</p><p>Victorin Lurel, President of the Regional Council of Guadeloupe which hosted the conference, illustrated the leadership role of Guadeloupe in renewable energy deployment and indicated that reaching a share of 50% renewable energy by 2020 in the EU Overseas was achievable.</p><p>Building on the BEST (voluntary scheme for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Territories of European overseas) preparatory action, which was initiated as a response to the call of the Message from Reunion Island in 2008 for a voluntary scheme for promotion and actions in conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services in EU overseas entities, the Message from Guadeloupe promotes BEST as a sustainable partnership of all stakeholders through a dedicated financial and representative governance structure. High level participants from the European Commission, the French government and the Regional Council of Guadeloupe also expressed their support for BEST. Kedrick Pickering, Deputy Premier of the British Virgin Islands, underpinned this by adding that \"the BEST partnership can be a powerful tool to increase access to financing by us all at various levels\".  </p><p>\"The Message from Guadeloupe demonstrates a high level of ambition and a way forward for the implementation of concrete goals, which we expect will ultimately lead to the EU's overseas entities reaching, - and even leading - the implementation of the Aichi international biodiversity targets by 2020,\" said Julia Marton-Lef\u00e8vre, Director General of IUCN.</p><p>\"The adoption of the Message of Guadeloupe is of particular importance to EU Overseas entities and their neighbouring countries as they are especially vulnerable in the face of climate change,\" said Nicolas Hulot, Special Envoy of the French President for the Protection of the Planet. \"The upcoming IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney will also help us emphasise the critical link between biodiversity and climate change and demonstrate how important healthy and robust ecosystems are to make us more resilient to the changes ahead. In the end, we, the inhabitants of this earth, are all islanders and we cannot escape the laws of nature.\"</p><p>Most EU Overseas entities are islands and as such are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, facing rising sea levels, ocean warming and acidification, as well as more frequent and violent storms and severe droughts.</p><p>\"Nature's solutions are at our fingertips, yet we often ignore them. If climate change adaptation policies and programmes are to be effective, they must integrate efforts to sustain and restore ecosystem functions and promote human rights under changing climate conditions,\" said Luc Bas, Director of IUCN's European Union Representative Office.</p><p>Overseas entities have a worldwide reach that is important to effective conservation actions. Located in every ocean of the world, they are exceptionally well placed for driving regional integration and collaboration on conservation action. Moreover, they are of economic importance, harbouring highly-valued ecosystems like coral reefs and polar seas rich in fish stocks.</p><p>\"With their diverse regional anchorages, overseas entities play a crucial intermediary role for developing regional partnerships with real leverage effects in terms of nature-based and cost efficient solutions for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development,\" said Carole Martinez, IUCN Programme Coordinator of the Regional Seas, EU Outermost Regions &amp; Overseas Countries &amp; Territories. \"Involving them at the international level is paramount to ensuring effectiveness in defining and implementing conservation measures\".</p><p>A technical report, assessing the progress made since the 2008 Message from Reunion Island, was presented during the conference and helped to guide workshop discussions on the adoption of the Message during the political segment of the conference. The assessment identified gaps including access to funding and the need to include sustainability criteria into policy frameworks, but also highlighted achievements such as the launch of the IUCN EU Overseas Roundtable in 2010 and the creation of the world's largest marine protected area in New Caledonia in April 2014.</p>", "publisher": "NEWS Press (English)", "instances": ["Over 250 high-level representatives and experts from more than 40 countries, territories and independent states have adopted the 'Message from Guadeloupe', a five-year roadmap, to counter biodiversity loss and climate change impacts in the EU's overseas regions and territories.

Dans ce contexte, la bio\u00e9conomie circulaire appelle \u00e0 donner la priorit\u00e9 non seulement aux solutions dans les secteurs responsables d'importantes \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre et de la d\u00e9gradation de l'environnement, mais aussi au financement d'instruments qui peuvent \u00eatre directement int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans les cha\u00eenes d'approvisionnement de l'agriculture et de la sylviculture, que le <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Scaling-nature-finance-now_-The-opportunity-for-investors-in-Brazil-and-beyond_final.pdf\">Forum \u00e9conomique mondial a r\u00e9cemment \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 plus de 21 milliards de dollars</url>.</p><h>D\u00e9velopper de nouvelles cha\u00eenes de valeur commerciales</h><p>Enfin, il est important de garder \u00e0 l'esprit que la nature est \u00e9galement une source d'inspiration pour les nouvelles entreprises de la bio\u00e9conomie circulaire.</p><p>Lors de la COP 16, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant d'apprendre que le biomim\u00e9tisme - une discipline qui s'inspire et imite les strat\u00e9gies utilis\u00e9es par les organismes vivants pour relever les d\u00e9fis soci\u00e9taux - a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 plus de 125 millions de dollars d'investissements dans des start-up inspir\u00e9es par la nature. Un exemple notable est celui de Sparxell, qui produit des peintures \u00e0 partir de cellulose en s'inspirant des structures physiques qui cr\u00e9ent les couleurs vives des oiseaux et des papillons, \u00e9liminant ainsi le besoin de colorants chimiques. En outre, nous avons pris connaissance des efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le secteur de l'assurance pour mettre au point des outils qui permettent non seulement de r\u00e9duire les risques li\u00e9s aux investissements dans la nature, mais aussi d'assurer les actifs naturels, tels que les r\u00e9cifs coralliens et les mangroves, pour la protection qu'ils offrent aux entreprises locales contre les temp\u00eates c\u00f4ti\u00e8res.</p><p>Sur la base de ce th\u00e8me de la valorisation de la nature, une autre r\u00e9alisation importante de la COP 16 a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'accord sur l'op\u00e9rationnalisation du fonds Cali.

Cette d\u00e9cision porte sur la mani\u00e8re dont les applications des DSI dans des domaines tels que la m\u00e9decine, l'agriculture, la biotechnologie et la sant\u00e9 publique doivent garantir que les avantages sont partag\u00e9s avec les pays en d\u00e9veloppement, les peuples autochtones et les communaut\u00e9s locales.</p><h>Alors quelle est la prochaine \u00e9tape\u202f?</h><p>Alors que nous nous pr\u00e9parons pour la prochaine COP 30 sur le climat au Br\u00e9sil en 2025, o\u00f9 la bio\u00e9conomie circulaire sera au centre des pr\u00e9occupations, il est essentiel de reconna\u00eetre que, bien que la COP 16 n'ait peut-\u00eatre pas abouti aux perc\u00e9es attendues en mati\u00e8re de n\u00e9gociation, de nombreuses options sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 disponibles pour le secteur priv\u00e9 afin de faire progresser ses efforts en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9duction des investissements nuisibles \u00e0 la nature et d'augmentation des financements positifs pour la nature.</p><p>La bio\u00e9conomie circulaire rappelle avec force l'interconnexion de toutes les actions actuellement men\u00e9es pour lutter contre la crise de la nature et du climat, tout en int\u00e9grant des consid\u00e9rations sociales.
