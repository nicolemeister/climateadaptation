The big blue blindspot: why the ocean floor is still an unmapped mysteryAsked whether Vanuatu is seeking \"reparations\" for the damage already done, Regenvanu emphasised that the case is about climate justice \u2013 holding those who caused the crisis responsible for fixing it. Justice means if you cause a problem, you are responsible for dealing with it and making up for it,\" Regenvanu said. \"And I think reparations is a word you could use. It is to do with fixing the problem you created. A strong opinion delivered by the ICJ could open the door to a new wave of legal challenges and lay the groundwork for countries like Vanuatu to pursue compensation through national or regional courts. It becomes a legal precedent that can be used in any court."]}, {"relevance_score": 40, "title": "Activism - Forty years after the Rainbow Warrior bombing, activists still under attack", "published": "2025-07-10", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forty years ago this week, the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior was sunk by two bombs planted by French secret service operatives.

He answered the nonprofit's plea for lawyers willing to give at least 20 hours a week to an upcoming case. More than 80 volunteered.       </p><p>Earlier this year, Mr. Trump issued a flurry of executive orders and implicit threats targeting major law firms whose past work or clients he did not like. While some of the firms chose to fight the orders and have so far prevailed in court, others hastened to settle, agreeing in the process to steer about $1 billion in pro bono work toward the administration's favored causes. Even some of those who stood up to Mr. Trump have been leery of further provoking his ire by taking on cases opposing the administration.       </p><p>But lawyers like Mr. Ansell have been eager to jump in. He helped interview plaintiffs for a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia late last month against the Environmental Protection Agency.

Earlier this month, a coalition of human rights groups led an unsuccessful challenge to the administration's deportation of eight migrants to South Sudan.        </p><p> Several groups sued immediately after the Supreme Court's ruling last month limiting the ability of lower-court judges to block executive branch policies nationwide, including Mr. Trump's order banning birthright citizenship. A New Hampshire judge blocked the citizenship order after certifying the suit as a class action, one of the few remaining avenues to impose such a far-reaching limit after the high court's ruling.       </p><p>\"If every single immigrant who has a baby in the U.S. has to sue to obtain citizenship, we are happy to create an army of lawyers to represent those people,\" Mr. DiBianco said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Small and Mighty'</emphasis></p><p>After the big firm Perkins Coie sued the Justice Department to block Mr. Trump's executive order against it, 504 firms signed a friend of the court brief on its behalf.       </p><p>The brief has become a test of mettle among lawyers, who checked it to see which big names were willing to stand up publicly to Mr. Trump. Not many, it turned out. Only eight of the nation's top 100 firms signed the brief, including WilmerHale, Susman Godfrey, Jenner &amp; Block and Covington &amp; Burling, all of which were also targeted by Mr. Trump's executive orders and sued to block them.       </p><p>The vast majority of signers are far smaller. Karen C.

It was to \"degrade\" the jobs, breaking them into simpler tasks to be performed over and over at a rapid clip. Small shops of skilled mechanics gave way to hundreds of workers spread across an assembly line. The personal secretary gave way to pools of typists and data-entry clerks.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The workers \"complained of speed-up, work intensification, and work degradation,\" as the labor historian Jason Resnikoff described it.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Something similar appears to be happening with artificial intelligence in one of the fields where it has been most widely adopted: coding.       </p><p>As A.I. spreads through the labor force, many white-collar workers have expressed concern that it would lead to mass unemployment. But while joblessness has ticked up and widespread layoffs might eventually come, the more immediate downside for software engineers appears to be a change in the quality of their work. Some say it is becoming more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.       </p><p>Companies seem to be persuaded that, like assembly lines of old, A.I. can increase productivity. A recent paper by researchers at Microsoft and three universities found that programmers' use of an A.I. coding assistant called Copilot, which proposes snippets of code that they can accept or reject, increased a key measure of output more than 25 percent.       </p><p>At Amazon, which is making big investments in generative A.I., the culture of coding is changing rapidly. In his recent letter to shareholders, Andy Jassy, the chief executive, wrote that generative A.I. was yielding big returns for companies that use it for \"productivity and cost avoidance.\" He said working faster was essential because competitors would gain ground if Amazon doesn't give customers what they want \"as quickly as possible\" and cited coding as an activity where A.I. would \"change the norms.\"       </p><p>Those changing norms have not always been eagerly embraced. Three Amazon engineers said that managers had increasingly pushed them to use A.I. in their work over the past year. The engineers said that the company had raised output goals and had become less forgiving about deadlines. It has even encouraged coders to gin up new A.I. productivity tools at an upcoming hackathon, an internal coding competition. One Amazon engineer said his team was roughly half the size it had been last year, but it was expected to produce roughly the same amount of code by using A.I.       </p><p>Amazon said it conducts regular reviews to make sure teams are adequately staffed and may increase their size if necessary. \"We'll continue to adapt how we incorporate Gen A.I. into our processes,\" Brad Glasser, an Amazon spokesman, said.       </p><p>Other tech companies are moving in the same direction. In a memo to employees in April, the chief executive of Shopify, a company that helps entrepreneurs build and manage e-commerce websites, announced that \"A.I. usage is now a baseline expectation\" and that the company would \"add A.I. usage questions\" to performance reviews.       </p><p>Google recently told employees it would soon hold a companywide hackathon in which one category would be creating A.I. tools that could \"enhance their overall daily productivity,\" according to an internal announcement. Winning teams will receive $10,000. A Google spokesman noted that more than 30 percent of the company's code is now suggested by A.I. and accepted by developers.       </p><p>The shift has not been all negative for workers. At Amazon and other companies, managers argue that A.I. can relieve employees of tedious tasks and enable them to perform more interesting work. Mr. Jassy wrote last year that the company had saved \"the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years\" by using A.I. to do the thankless work of upgrading old software.       </p><p>Eliminating such tedious work may benefit a subset of accomplished programmers, said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University who has tracked research on the subject closely.       </p><p>But for inexperienced programmers, the result of introducing A.I. can resemble the shift from artisanal work to factory work in the 19th and 20th centuries. \"Things look like a speed-up for knowledge workers,\" Dr. Katz said, describing preliminary evidence from ongoing research. \"There is a sense that the employer can pile on more stuff.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bystanders in Their Own Jobs</emphasis></p><p>The automation of coding has special resonance for Amazon engineers, who have watched their blue-collar counterparts undergo a similar transition.       </p><p>For years, many workers at Amazon warehouses walked miles each day to track down inventory. But over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly relied on so-called robotics warehouses, where pickers stand in one spot and pull inventory off shelves delivered to them by lawn-mower-like robots, no walking necessary.       </p><p>The robots generally haven't displaced humans; Amazon said it has hired hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers since their introduction, while creating many new skilled roles. But the robots have increased the number of items each worker can pick to hundreds from dozens an hour. Some workers complain that the robots have also made the job hyper-repetitive and physically taxing. Amazon says it provides regular breaks and cites positive feedback from workers about its cutting edge robots.       </p><p>The Amazon engineers said this transition was on their minds as the company urged them to rely more on A.I. They said that, while doing so was technically optional, they had little choice if they wanted to keep up with their output goals, which affect their performance reviews.       </p><p>The expectations have sped up rapidly. One engineer said that building a feature for the website used to take a few weeks; now it must frequently be done within a few days. He said this is possible only by using A.I. to help automate the coding and by cutting down on meetings with colleagues to solicit feedback and explore alternative ideas. (A second engineer said her efficiency gains from using A.I. were more modest; Amazon has more than 10,000 software engineers and different teams use the tools more or less intensively.)       </p><p>The new approach to coding at many companies has, in effect, eliminated much of the time the developer spends reflecting on his or her work. \"It used to be that you had a lot of slack because you were doing a complicated project - it would maybe take a month, maybe take two months, and no one could monitor it,\" Dr. Katz said. \"Now, you have the whole thing monitored, and it can be done quickly.\"       </p><p>As at Microsoft, many Amazon engineers use an A.I. assistant that suggests lines of code. But the company has more recently rolled out A.I. tools that can generate large portions of a program on its own. One engineer called the tools \"scarily good.\" The engineers said many colleagues have been reluctant to use these new tools because they require a lot of double-checking and because the engineers want to have more control.       </p><p>\"It's more fun to write code than to read code,\" said Simon Willison, an A.I. fan who is a longtime programmer and blogger, channeling the objections of other programmers. \"If you're told you have to do a code review, it's never a fun part of the job. When you're working with these tools, it's most of the job.\"       </p><p>This shift from writing to reading code can make engineers feel as if they are bystanders in their own jobs. The Amazon engineers said that managers have encouraged them to use A.I. to help write one-page memos proposing a solution to a software problem and that the artificial intelligence can now generate a rough draft from scattered thoughts.       </p><p>They also use A.I. to test the software features they build, a tedious job that nonetheless has forced them to think deeply about their coding. One said that automating these functions could deprive junior engineers of the know-how they need to get promoted.       </p><p>Amazon said that collaboration and experimentation remain critical and that it considers A.I. a tool for augmenting rather than replacing engineers' expertise. It said it makes the requirements for promotions clear to employees.       </p><p>Harper Reed, another longtime programmer and blogger who was the chief technology officer of former President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, agreed that career advancement for engineers could be an issue in an A.I. world.

We have a voice and ought to be heard, and even to channel impact through a creative way, because we believe everyone has a role to play, we have the impact that can be done in terms of policy, in terms of people entering into negotiation groups. But even creatives, we can do that as much as of being an engineer. I'm an engineer and a musician too, so as much as I can channel impact through the professional side, I can send an input through a creative way and still people hear the message and take action."]}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "This New Year, Resolve to Green Up Your News Feed", "published": "2025-01-02", "bodyText": "<h>ABSTRACT</h><p>These organizations are capturing local and regional news about climate and environmental justice that often flies under the national radar.</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 13, "title": "COP29: Activists call on rich polluters to pay, urge Global South delegates to stand firm", "published": "2024-11-20", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activists from the Global campaign to demand climate justice (DCJ) demonstrated once again Wednesday (Nov. 20) inside the COP29 venue in Baku.</emphasis></p><p>They were demanding what they view as a just deal on financial compensation.</p><p>Negotiators at the UN's climate talks are to clear away the technical part of talks to focus on substance.</p><p>\"People from civil society and movements are calling for both the governments and not governments to pay up for climate finance and to pay up in the scale of trillions, not billions because communities on the front lines of the climate crisis in the global South need this money for adaptation and mitigation, but also for loss and damage because they're bearing the brunt of a crisis they had the least role in causing.''</p><p>Vulnerable nations are seeking $1.3 trillion to deal with damage from climate change and to adapt to that change.</p><p>Kenyan climate activist Eric Njuguna calls on these representatives to stand firm in their position.</p><p>''We're sending a message to Global South negotiators to hold the line, to not to barge at a time when Global North countries are pushing back and negotiating for lower amounts and pushing for even more private finance.

Prices plunged. And large Western oil companies were hemorrhaging money, with losses topping $100 billion, according to the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.       </p><p>Renewable energy, it seemed to many companies and investors at the time, was not just cleaner - it was a better business than oil and gas.       </p><p>\"Investors were focused on what I would say was the prevailing narrative around it's all moving to wind and solar,\" Darren Woods, Exxon Mobil's chief executive, said in an interview with The New York Times last week at a United Nations climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. \"I had a lot of pressure to get into the wind and solar business,\" he added.       </p><p>Mr. Woods resisted, reasoning that Exxon did not have expertise in those areas. Instead, the company invested in areas like hydrogen and lithium extraction that are more akin to its traditional business.       </p><p>Wall Street has rewarded the company for those bets. The company's stock price has climbed more than 70 percent since the end of 2019, lifting its market valuation to a record of nearly $560 billion in October, though it has since fallen to about $524 billion.       </p><p>The American oil giant's performance stands in contrast with BP and Shell, oil and gas companies based in London that embraced wind, solar and other technologies like electric-vehicle charging. BP's stock has fallen around 19 percent in that time, based on trading in London, while Shell's has climbed about 15 percent.       </p><p>The market's renewed acceptance of fossil fuels underscores one of the core challenges of curbing global emissions: Climate change poses risks that compound over decades. Scientists say every fraction of a degree of warming caused by fossil fuels brings greater risks from deadly heat waves, wildfires, drought, storms and species extinction. But investors are focused on making money over months and years.       </p><p>\"If we want to combat climate change, we need to make it in the firms' and consumers' self-interest to produce and buy the low-carbon alternatives,\" said Christopher Knittel, a professor of energy economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.       </p><p>The election of Donald J. Trump, who has falsely described global warming as a hoax, has led to even greater optimism about the oil and gas business.       </p><p>The difference in profits that companies can make from extracting oil and gas and what they can earn from harnessing wind and solar had already swung sharply in favor of fossil fuels in recent years.       </p><p>The median return on capital among some of the world's biggest investor-owned oil companies, a key measure of profitability, topped 11 percent last year, up from negative 8 percent in 2020, according to an analysis by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The median return over that same period for the top renewable energy companies has stayed around 2 percent.       </p><p>\"If you look at the relative shareholder returns, the market's been sending a very clear signal that it wants energy companies to focus on their core competencies,\" said Mark Viviano, a managing partner at Kimmeridge, an energy investment firm based in Denver and New York. \"That doesn't mean abandoning the energy transition, but it just means being more pragmatic about it.\"       </p><p>BP pledged in 2020 to cut its oil and gas production 40 percent by the end of the decade. Less than three years later, it backtracked and said it would increase spending on fossil fuels. The company wrote off $1.1 billion in offshore wind investments last year and recently said it wanted to sell other wind assets, though it continues to invest in renewable energy.       </p><p>\"We will be very, very returns-focused, making sure that the new businesses compete on a competitive level with the historic businesses for scarce capital,\" the company's chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, told financial analysts on a recent conference call.       </p><p>Shell has softened or discarded some of its emissions-reduction targets, as it scaled back growth expectations for its renewable power business.       </p><p>\"We do not see ourselves as being advantaged in renewable generation to create material returns over others,\" Wael Sawan, Shell's chief executive, told analysts recently. \"And so you do see us stepping back.\"       </p><p>In the United States, where environmentally conscious investing has become increasingly politicized, investors have gone from regularly quizzing oil and gas executives about their energy transition plans to zeroing in on projects that are more likely to lift the bottom line soon, executives said.       </p><p>\"Some people jumped the gun and moved toward some paths that ultimately turned out to be, I'd say, devastating to their bottom line,\" Toby Rice, the chief executive of a Pittsburgh natural gas producer, EQT, said in an interview. \"They've now come back to center.\"       </p><p>That said, the oil and gas business is subject to wild price swings that can quickly make fortunes and dash them just as rapidly. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, investors turned away from domestic producers after sustaining bruising losses as the companies chased production growth. Renewable energy tends to be a far steadier business.       </p><p>Investors still widely expect oil and gas companies to curb their emissions by, among other things, plugging leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

In a report last month documenting the arrests, Human Rights Watch urged countries that participate in the climate meeting in Baku, the capital, to \"speak out vocally\" about \"the worsening environment for civil society.\"       </p><p>But the international response has been muted. In the Caucasus, the mountainous region where Europe and Asia meet, Mr. Aliyev has emerged as a dominant player after 21 years of rule. With modern weaponry funded by oil and gas revenues, his military defeated neighboring Armenia in 2020 and again last year in a long-running conflict.       </p><p>At the same time, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have elevated Azerbaijan as a key partner for the West. The European Union sees Azerbaijan as an alternative to Russia as a source of fossil fuels, and it pledged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine to double imports of natural gas from Azerbaijan by 2027.       </p><p>Azerbaijan is also a key partner for Israel, importing Israeli weaponry and selling Israel oil.       </p><p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has spoken to Mr. Aliyev at least five times this year, according to the State Department, hailing \"a growing number of partnership initiatives\" between the United States and Azerbaijan. A senior European diplomat, insisting on anonymity to speak candidly, said Mr. Aliyev's recent crackdown stemmed from a calculation that, in Azerbaijan's view, the West \"needs us more than we need them.\"       </p><p>\"We have our own role to contribute in the energy security of the European Union,\" Mr. Hajiyev, the adviser to the Azerbaijani president, said. He condemned \"the weaponization of human rights issues,\" describing them as attempts \"to push Azerbaijan into a corner.\"       </p><p>Highlighting his geopolitical options, Mr. Aliyev has telegraphed an ever-closer relationship with Russia without endorsing President Vladimir V. Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Putin made a two-day visit to Azerbaijan in August, and Russia's foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, followed up with a trip last month.       </p><p>Announcing Mr. Naryshkin's trip, his spy agency said Azerbaijan was an ally in countering Western intelligence services trying to undermine \"internal political stability in our states.\"       </p><p>Last week, Mr. Aliyev traveled to Kazan, Russia, for Mr. Putin's marquee geopolitical event of the year: the BRICS summit, which brought together an expanding club of non-Western countries including Brazil, India, China and South Africa.       </p><p>Mr. Aliyev \"doesn't have to fear a harsh reaction from the West,\" said Rauf Mirgadirov, an Azerbaijani political analyst living in exile in Switzerland. \"As long as he's not totally come under Russia's sway, the West will be in dialogue with him.\"       </p><p>The U.N. climate conference, scheduled for Nov. 11-22 and with scores of world leaders in attendance, is likely to further raise Mr. Aliyev's global stature.

Six of its journalists, including its top editors, have been arrested since last November.       </p><p>Leyla Mustafayeva, an Azerbaijani journalist who now runs Abzas Media from exile in Berlin, said in an interview that the summit \"is a disaster for us\" because it provides a distraction from Azerbaijan's human rights abuses.       </p><p>\"This event is going to completely cover up all these issues,\" Ms. Mustafayeva said.       </p><p>The conference will come as Mr. Aliyev, 62, cements his dominance inside his country of about 10 million people. Abandoning decades of mediation efforts involving both Russia and the West, Mr. Aliyev used his modernized military to crush Armenian forces in a 44-day war in 2020 and again in a lightning operation last year.       </p><p>The victories recaptured the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, which for more than 20 years had existed as an ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan's internationally recognized borders. Tens of thousands of Armenians who had inhabited the region were forced to flee.       </p><p>In Azerbaijan, where about 10 percent of the population was displaced from the same area by Armenia's victory in a war between the countries in the 1990s, the victories increased Mr. Aliyev's popularity.       </p><p>Armenia and Azerbaijan are now negotiating a peace deal and potential transportation links through Armenia toward Turkey.

exacerbating current economic hardships faced by Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and SIDS.</p><p>The expected losses from climate change for SIDS are estimated to be up to 6.5 % of annual GDP, in

for LDCs and SIDS.</p><p>Too often the debate on financing for climate change and other development issues are reduced to the limited analysis of raw GDP numbers or debt ratios rather than a more nuanced understanding of how economies work and the unique challenges faced by smaller more vulnerable nations.</p><p>To contribute to this debate the Commonwealth Secretariat launched its Universal Vulnerability Index (UVI) (2021) which is geared to capture more refined insights on the state of a nation's vulnerability and resilience.</p><p>The UVI separates measurements for structural resilience and structural vulnerability, therefore putting less emphasis on the snapshot of nominal GDP and building in a flexible ranking of a country's ability to rebuild.</p><p>The Commonwealth

member states access to finance and scale up climate action.</p><p>The Hub was launched in 2016 and has already supported member states to mobilise millions of dollars of climate finance with hundreds of millions in the pipeline.</p><p>Another recent project the 'Their Future, Our Action' project, is a collaboration between the Commonwealth Secretariat and the University of Cambridge's Centre for Resilience and Sustainable Development (CRSD), embarks on ground-breaking action-based research to support the deployment of greater sustainability-related funds into SIDS by redesigning altogether how climate and resilience finance is accessed.</p><p>The project has already borne fruit, unlocking more than $10m of private financing for Small Island Developing States.</p><p>A key outcome, so far, from the research, is the recognition of SIDS vast untapped assets in their young populations and in their natural assets which could be leveraged to catalyse greater climate finance flows into SIDS.</p><p>A key part of the project is developing investment measures that reward SIDS for good stewardship of their natural assets.</p><p>'Honour commitments'</p><p>If the world is to come together and tackle the real and pressing issues faced by LDCs and SIDS, it is essential that developed countries honour their commitments and pledges to deliver financing and related technical assistance.</p><p>Every promise needs to be kept and every option explored to enable the Commonwealth Member States - indeed all countries everywhere - to adequately deal with the immense task of climate change.</p><p>Because if we fail in this task, and fall into disharmony and discord, we will fail not just this generation but all future generations and inevitably see the diverse chorus of

Here's Why.", "published": "2024-05-29", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president wants to shift America's car fleet toward electric vehicles, but not at the expense of American jobs or national security.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Biden wants more of America's cars and trucks to run on electricity, not gas. His administration has pushed that goal on multiple fronts, including strict new regulations of auto emissions and lavish new subsidies to help American consumers take as much as $7,500 off the cost of a new electric vehicle.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Biden's aides agree that electric vehicles - which retail for more than $53,000 on average in the United States - would sell even faster here if they were less expensive. As it happens, there is a wave of new electric vehicles that are significantly cheaper than the ones customers can currently buy in the United States. They are proving extremely popular in Europe.       </p><p>But the president and his team do not want Americans to buy these cheap cars, which retail elsewhere for as little as $10,000, because they are made in China. That's true even though a surge of low-cost imported electric vehicles might help drive down car prices overall, potentially helping Mr. Biden in his re-election campaign at a time when inflation remains voters' top economic concern.       </p><p>Instead, the president is taking steps to make Chinese electric vehicles prohibitively expensive, in large part to protect American automakers. Mr. Biden signed an executive action earlier this month that quadruples tariffs on those cars to 100 percent.       </p><p>Those tariffs will put many potential Chinese imports at a significant cost disadvantage to electric vehicles made in America. But some models, like the discount BYD Seagull, could still cost less than some American rivals even after tariffs, which is one reason Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and some other Democrats have called on Mr. Biden to ban Chinese E.V. imports entirely.       </p><p>The apparent clash between climate concerns and American manufacturing has upset some environmentalists and liberal economists, who say the country and the world would be better off if Mr. Biden welcomed the importation of low-cost, low-emission technologies to fight climate change.       </p><p>Mr. Biden and his aides reject that critique. They say the president's efforts to restrict Chinese electric cars and other clean-technology imports are an important counter to illegal and harmful trade practices being carried out by Beijing.        </p><p>And they insist that Mr. Biden's trade approach will ultimately benefit American jobs and national security - along with the planet.       </p><p>Here are the policy and political considerations driving Mr. Biden's attempt to shield American producers from Chinese competition.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denying Beijing a new monopoly</emphasis></p><p>China already dominates key clean-energy manufacturing in areas like solar cells and batteries. Mr. Biden's aides want to prevent it from gaining monopolies in similar industries, like electric vehicles, for several reasons.       </p><p>They include climate concerns. Administration officials say Chinese factories, which tend to be powered by fossil fuels like coal, produce more greenhouse gas emissions than American plants.       </p><p>There is also a central economic reason to deny China a monopoly: ensuring that electric cars and trucks will always be available, at competitive prices. The Covid-19 pandemic drove home the fragility of global supply chains, as critical products like semiconductors became hard to get from China and other Asian nations that the United States relied upon. Prices for consumer electronics and other products that relied on imported materials soared, fueling inflation.       </p><p>Biden officials want to avoid a similar scenario for electric vehicles.

Ms. Crawford, 20, said she connects the suffering of Gazans to the plight of other oppressed people worldwide.       </p><p>\"When you are a part of any oppressed group, especially people that are experiencing direct state violence like being part of the Pan-African diaspora within the United States, which is built on the enslavement and dehumanization and degradation of African peoples, that does politicize you,\" Ms. Crawford said.       </p><p>At Emory University, protesters occupying the campus quad have chanted \"Free Palestine,\" along with \"Stop Cop City,\" referring to a large police and fire training compound being built on the outskirts of Atlanta.       </p><p>Ari Quan, a 19-year-old Emory first-year student from Columbia, S.C., who uses the pronouns they and them, acknowledged not having followed the conflict in Gaza especially closely, but said there was considerable overlap between the movement for greater justice in policing and pro-Palestinian sentiment.

Students for Justice in Palestine, a loosely connected confederation that began to emerge in the early 1990s at the University of California, Berkeley, consciously invited other activists - environmentalists, opponents of American intervention in Latin America, critics of the Gulf War - broadening the group's base.       </p><p>Today, the group's national steering committee claims more than 200 autonomous chapters, most of them in the United States.

Many simply said that the attacks were awful.       </p><p>But Lila Steinbach, a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, acknowledged that the attacks stirred up complicated emotions. She knows people who were killed and taken hostage in the attacks. Like many of the protesters, she was raised Jewish.       </p><p>\"What happened on Oct. 7 was a test of my politics, as someone who is committed to liberalization and decolonization,\" she said, adding, \"It's hard to not condemn all of the violence being committed by Hamas.\"       </p><p>Yet, she added, \"I also know that the violence of the Israelis and the violence of U.S. imperialism and the conditions cultivated by those actors are responsible for breeding terrorism. When you grow up in an open air prison and you're orphaned and you are told that Israelis are at fault, why wouldn't you believe them?\"       </p><p>Antisemitism, almost all the student protesters said, is a real concern.       </p><p>But they said they just do not see it around them - not in their encampments, not among the other protesters, not in their chants, such as \"from the river to the sea.\" (In their view, \"from the river to the sea\" is not a call to wipe out the state of Israel, but a call for peace and equality.)       </p><p>On Sunday, a few dozen protesters hung around the encampment at the University of Pittsburgh. Alexandra Weiner, 25, a faculty member in the math department at the university, said that she grew up attending the Tree of Life Synagogue, where a white nationalist gunned down 11 worshipers in 2018.       </p><p>While some counterprotesters had called the encampment antisemitic, she said, \"I have not experienced or heard a single sentiment of antisemitism.\"       </p><p>Later that day, hundreds of protesters marched on campus, calling for a cease-fire.

Students freely salted their explanations with academic terms like intersectionality, colonialism and imperialism, all to make their case that the plight of Palestinians is a result of global power structures that thrive on bias and oppression. \"As an environmentalist, we pride ourselves on viewing the world through intersectional lenses,\" said Katie Rueff, a first-year student at Cornell University. \"Climate justice is an everyone issue.

Critics say the hipsters have taken over, but the approach has attracted fans around the world.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the back room of the threadbare offices of the Irish soccer team Bohemians, the printer clunks and chugs and whirs incessantly, spitting out a cascade of shipping labels. Some of the addresses bear the names of nearby Dublin streets. Others are from farther afield: across Ireland, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each label will be affixed to a package containing a Bohemians jersey. And these days, the club sells a lot of jerseys.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The appeal is not rooted in any of the traditional drivers of soccer's merchandise market: success, glamour, a beloved star player. Daniel Lambert, the club's chief operating officer, loves both Bohemians and the League of Ireland, the competition in which it plays, but he is under no illusions about the reality of either. \"We're a small team in a poor league,\" he said.       </p><p>Instead, fans are drawn to Bohemians by the jerseys themselves; or, rather, what the jerseys say, both about the team and the customer.       </p><p>Some recent editions have drawn on the cultural iconography of Dublin: the Poolbeg cooling towers; the pattern from the city's bus seats; the face of Phil Lynott, former frontman of the band Thin Lizzy. Others send a more explicit message: One of this season's efforts has been designed in the colors of the Palestinian flag. A couple of years ago, another bore the slogan \"Refugees Welcome.\"       </p><p>In a studiously apolitical sport, where most teams avoid staking out positions except on the safest of ground - and at a time when Ireland is trying to douse the sparks of a flickering culture war - that makes Bohemians an enthusiastic, unabashed outlier: a rare example of a soccer club willing to wear its values on its sleeve, its torso and any other surface it can find.       </p><p>At Dalymount Park, Bohemians' tumbledown home, the corner flags bear the rainbow colors of the Pride movement. Fans walk the concourses in scarves bearing both the club crest and the Palestinian colors. Corrugated iron walls are decorated with images of Che Guevara and the Venezuelan flag.       </p><p>Behind one section, home to the most boisterous of the club's supporters, a fist rises against a red-and-black background. \"Love football, hate racism,\" it reads.       </p><p>It has been placed there quite deliberately. Bohemians might lean, unapologetically, to the left, but the club has been more than willing to harness distinctly capitalist marketing strategies to amplify its reach. \"The politics are absolutely sincere,\" Dion Fanning, a writer, author and co-host of the podcast Free State, said. \"But the way they do it is very clever.\"       </p><p>Much of that can be attributed to Mr. Lambert's background in music. He thinks, essentially and habitually, like a promoter. \"It's in that section that younger fans are taking selfies and uploading them to Instagram,\" Mr. Lambert said. \"This way they have that message in there, too.\"       </p><p>It is hard to argue that the approach is not working. Bohemians' appeal now stretches far beyond its traditional base in the north Dublin suburb of Phibsborough. It has captured the hearts and minds of a congregation of fans across the world, diffused by geography but united - in Mr. Lambert's eyes - by common priorities.       </p><p>Bohemians attracts fans, he said, who are \"socially conscious, concerned about what has happened to the game, uncomfortable with state actors being in charge of these precious things that belong to the working class.\"       </p><p>There are enough of them that Bohemians now stands as a remarkable commercial success story. A little more than a decade ago, the club stood on the verge of a first-ever relegation from the top tier of Irish soccer and the brink of financial oblivion. Now, it is a picture of health. In 2015, the club had only 530 members. That figure now stands at 3,000. \"With a waiting list,\" Mr. Lambert noted.       </p><p>There are 10 teams in the League of Ireland, yet Bohemians accounts for a quarter of the league's commercial revenue. The club's merchandise sales alone have soared by 2,000 percent in a decade. The orders for jerseys that pour in every day are not just for the newest versions, either; old editions continue to sell well, something Mr. Lambert attributes to the fact that they are not ephemeral fashion items. \"They tell a story,\" he said.       </p><p>That story, and the club's rise alongside it, has not always been universally popular. Mr. Lambert conceded that some Bohemians fans may have been put off by the club's activism - on subjects as diverse as gay marriage, climate justice and the ending of what he terms Ireland's \"inhumane\" handling of asylum seekers - and he has long detected a low-grade grumbling among supporters of rival teams.       </p><p>It is, after all, fair to say that very few soccer teams have an in-house poet, or host halftime raves, or employ four members of staff devoted to establishing a climate strategy. \"We've heard it all: the hipster club, a load of gimmicks,\" Mr. Lambert said. \"You do hear people say: 'Why can't Bohs just be normal?'\"       </p><p>The answer to that, Mr. Lambert said, is simple. Bohemians does not see the positions it takes as inherently political. To the club, they are humanitarian issues, the natural values of a team owned not by a private investor but by its fans. And expressing them, he and others said, is more pressing than ever, as Ireland's incipient far right grows in both strength and volume.       </p><p>\"There is something at stake now,\" said Mr. Fanning, the podcast host. \"A few years ago, when Bohemians started doing this, you would have said Ireland would never have a far right. Now, it is still several levels below a subculture, but it is there, and it will get bigger.\"       </p><p>That, Mr. Lambert said, is what makes the decision to bind the club to its beliefs even more important. \"The purpose of a club is to be a force for good,\" he said. \"I think people are quite often desensitized to a lot of these issues. You can use sport to bring them to people's attention, to engage with them, to put pressure on governments to address them. Sport has an obligation to do that.\"       </p><p>As much as Bohemians' activism is rooted in its beliefs, though, it has also been good for business. Crowds across the League of Ireland have grown in recent years - the precise cause of that phenomenon is hotly debated - but tickets for Bohemians games are now particularly precious possessions.       </p><p>Mary Nolan, who has been attending games with her father since she was a child, said, \"You see more women, more kids, more families.\"       </p><p>\"There's still a few old men who moan that none of the newcomers know anything about football, but it's generally a very welcoming space now,\" she added. \"Far more people have been drawn in than put off by the politics.\"       </p><p>And even those fans who might not naturally be inclined to see a soccer team as the correct vehicle for social justice have little reason to complain. There is no wealthy private benefactor to write the checks. There is no generous television deal. Transfer fees for selling player to larger leagues are unreliable and often measly.       </p><p>The club's messaging, and its willingness to take stands, puts Bohemians in a \"far stronger position,\" as Mr. Lambert put it. It helps to finance all the work the club does off the field, and helps to pay for the team that plays on it.       </p><p>\"My dad is naturally very liberal,\" Ms. Nolan said. \"He knows these causes matter. But he also understands, at the very least, that they help to sell a lot of jerseys.\"       </p><p>As long as that continues, there seems to be no reason for anyone to object. \"When I was a kid and a young man there was no contradiction between loving books and loving football,\" Roddy Doyle, the novelist and a lifelong Bohemians fan, wrote in an email. \"They were all cultural choices we made, our badges of identity.\"       </p><p>He added: \"Bohemians come close to delivering that blend that has always been my idea of culture: a stadium in an area that crackles with history and is also a magnet for newness; a team that wears jerseys that feature Dublin musicians and have 'Refugees Welcome' printed across their chests; fans who sing a song composed by Brendan Behan just before kickoff. Supporting Bohemians is a stew. But the football is vital.\"       </p><p>For all the causes, the activism, the growth and the commercial success, Mr. Doyle wrote, the best part of being a Bohemians fan to him is the same as it has always been: \"Being in the crowd when they score.\" </p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["The orders for jerseys that pour in every day are not just for the newest versions, either; old editions continue to sell well, something Mr. Lambert attributes to the fact that they are not ephemeral fashion items. \"They tell a story,\" he said.

It's symbolic because it sends out a strong message of solidarity, which is essential to ease the tensions between the countries of the North and the countries of the South in the run-up to the COP - tensions that have been exacerbated by the failure of developed countries to keep their promises. This fund formalises developed countries' recognition of their historical responsibility for climate change. It will provide significant support to vulnerable nations, those most affected by greenhouse gases and, at the same time, least responsible for their emissions.</p><p>Africa should not be 'bullied' on climate change</p><p>The fund is also useful because it will provide direct financial assistance to eligible countries. The objective is to facilitate repair and reconstruction when natural disasters occur, to support adaptation measures designed to increase resilience in the face of climate change, and to encourage the implementation of preventive strategies.</p><p>Following discussions, an agreement was reached on 4 November and confirmed in Dubai, stipulating that the World Bank would manage the fund for a transitional phase of four years. What do you think, given that this provisional solution is being criticised by developing countries?</p><p>As you made clear, this is a provisional solution. The provisional must not become permanent. Developing countries are calling for the fund to be independent because they fear that its positions will not be balanced and that it will favour the member countries of the World Bank.</p><p>COP28: Ruto, Hichilema, Ramaphosa... which African leaders will be in Dubai?</p><p>For the resolutions to be fair and equitable, representatives from both developing and developed countries must have equal weight in the decisions. If this principle is respected, the very structure of the World Bank will encourage the rapid establishment of this fund and effective capitalisation. Judging by our experience with the Green Climate Fund, which is autonomous, the establishment of the loss and damage fund could take a long time. So the compromise adopted for the sake of efficiency seems appropriate in the short and medium term.</p><p>Which countries should be given priority for accessing and financing the fund?</p><p>The committee has specified that the fund will target 'particularly vulnerable' developing countries. However, the criteria defining this vulnerability have yet to be defined. Generally speaking, this category includes the least developed countries, which the UN defines according to their GDP and various human development indicators. This classification currently covers 46 nations, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal and Niger, all of which have been hard hit by climate change.</p><p>A Green Africa needs long term money</p><p>The current directives merely provide a strong incentive for developed countries, which have historically been major emitters of greenhouse gases, to contribute to the financing of the fund. They are under no obligation to do so. This situation is worrying, especially given the disappointing track record of the rich countries in terms of climate financing: the financial commitments they made nearly 15 years ago have still not been fully honoured.</p><p>At COP28, the first financial contributions were announced. To set an example, the United Arab Emirates, host of this major climate conference, promised to allocate $100m to the fund. They were quickly followed by the European Union, which wants to contribute $242.6m, the US ($17m) and Japan ($10m). Is this satisfactory?</p><p>It's worth comparing to the Green Climate Fund, which was adopted in 2009 with an initial modest capitalisation of $10m. Today, we are starting with much higher commitments, potentially close to $800m. This is certainly a promising start, but it needs to be seen in the context of global needs, which are estimated at $580bn a year. Africa alone, which is particularly vulnerable to climate change, needs $2.8trn between now and 2030 to deal with the situation.</p><p>Oceans need a reinforced Africa-Europe partnership</p><p>So we're still a long way from the target, especially as no minimum amount has been set. In my opinion, it would be wise for this fund to collect at least $100bn in the long term if it is to be effective.</p><p>What conclusions do you draw from the 28th edition of COP?</p><p>Both the opening and closing of the COP show that significant, albeit imperfect, progress has been made in our 'directional shift' towards more sustainable and equitable economies. It does not mark a conclusion, but the beginning of a complex and demanding implementation phase that will pave the way for profound and fair change. However, the mobilisation [of nations] must be collective and balanced.</p><p>Powering West and Central Africa for brighter future</p><p>It is crucial to stay vigilant, demonstrate creativity and responsibility, and strengthen solidarity and commitment at all levels.

The answer depends, to a significant extent, on the European Union.</p><h>The European leadership</h><p>The EU has proven its aptitude for climate diplomacy. Both in the run-up to COP28, and during the negotiations in Dubai, it played a key role in catalysing momentum toward the adoption of targets for renewables and energy efficiency. Its behind-the-scenes efforts included deepening and leveraging its partnerships with climate-vulnerable countries; collaborating with COP28's host, the United Arab Emirates, and its president, Sultan Al Jaber; and engaging with international institutions like the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency.</p><p>As we head into 2024, no one is better equipped than the EU to lead the climate charge.

Of course, the EU will have to walk the talk, doing whatever it takes to ensure the policy package is duly implemented in the coming years. This includes, for example, creating a new EU Green Investment Plan that fills the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bruegel.org/policy-brief/new-governance-framework-safeguard-european-green-deal\">financing gap</url> left behind as the Next Generation EU pandemic-recovery fund is phased out.</p><p>The second imperative is to mobilise a renewed global effort to increase climate finance for developing economies - an area where COP28 fell short. While we now have global targets for renewables and energy efficiency, it is not clear how the required clean-energy investments - an estimated $4.3 trillion per year by 2030 - will be funded.

On this front, the COP28 MDB <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eib.org/attachments/press/cop28-joint-mdb-statement.pdf\">joint statement</url> - which includes a pledge to \"support country-led platforms to enhance in-country coordination and impact in all aspects of development,\" including climate - sets the stage for progress.</p><p>The third imperative for the EU is to foster effective cooperation on the energy transition among key global actors.

But real, tangible change does not happen at COPs; it happens in corporate boardrooms and at asset-management firms.</p><p>By providing policy certainty (through the European Green Deal) and engaging in constructive climate diplomacy, the EU can facilitate such change, translating the political consensus of COP28 into new energy-market dynamics and investment strategies.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["Nonetheless, it is safe to say that COP28 produced some achievements worth celebrating - if, that is, they are translated into effective action.

Countries in Africa are hamstrung by mounting debt costs and a dearth of finance, and despite an abundance of natural resources just three percent of energy investments worldwide are made in the continent. The three-day summit in Kenya is billed as bringing together leaders from the 54-nation continent to define a shared vision of Africa's green development. \"Delivering prosperity and wellbeing for Africa's growing population without pushing the world deeper into climate disaster is not an abstract proposition, or mere wishful thinking."]}, {"relevance_score": 40, "title": "One year on from a historic winter: Are we closer to solving our energy and climate crises?", "published": "2023-11-08", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across Europe, citizens are protesting against a system that is not working and are calling on polluters to pay for the energy transition, write Nicol\u00f2 Wojewoda and Chlo\u00e9 Mikolajczak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nicol\u00f2 Wojewoda is Europe Regional Director at </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">350.org</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, a campaign group.

Africa is home to some of the world's most potent renewable resources: its untapped renewable energy potential is over 50 times the world's anticipated electricity demand by 2040.

For example, Kenya already derives over 90% of its grid energy from green sources - and has only just begun to scratch the surface.</p><p>There is also a growing ecosystem of African start-ups using technology for green industries and processes across the economy, from clean cooking fuel to carbon capture and storage solutions. But these require risk capital and hands-on help to scale, attract further investment, and reach their potential. This was the thinking behind the partnership between FSD Africa Investments and Africa Climate Ventures - a new investment vehicle which aims to build Africa's first 'climate unicorns'.</p><p>Green Investment Africa boasts some of the world's greatest biodiversity, with massive natural mature carbon sinks consisting of forests, peatlands, mangroves, and 60% of the world's remaining unused arable land. To realise global net zero by 2050, we need to protect our planet's natural carbon sinks, make our consumption greener, and remove carbon from the atmosphere at a massive rate. More than any other region, Africa can rapidly scale these activities, providing immediate, diverse, and lasting climate benefits.</p><p>Uniquely among global locations, scaling up many of these opportunities in Africa does not require complex trade-offs, or painful transformations. In fact, the process could provide much-needed jobs for the continent's youth, as well as desperately needed energy access and sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Many of these opportunities will offer healthy financial returns, if there is fair and equitable access to financial markets. But realising this opportunity will demand unprecedented levels of investment. Indeed, by developing its renewable potential for on-continent use, Africa could generate reliable electricity access for all Africans - including the nearly 600 million currently without any energy access - by 2030 whilst reducing total emissions associated with energy production by 80% and with 30% lower costs. However, this will require 40% more upfront investment.</p><p>So the need for finance and investment will need to be front and centre of discussions at the Africa Climate Summit. That means ensuring reforms to the global financial architecture take account of the climate crisis and addressing the factors that are restricting the flow of green finance. It also means recognising that the perceived higher riskiness of investments into green assets in developing countries requires a big increase in the availability of concessional and smart capital as well as greater financial innovation to address systemic barriers.</p><p>Africa is ready to play its part and, as this summit will show, it offers many opportunities for green capital investment. The rest of the world can accelerate and amplify this by partnering with, and investing in, the continent as well as supporting market building initiatives to ensure it has the capacity to absorb the capital needed. If they do so, then Africa and her young, dynamic population can truly play their role as global climate leaders.</p><p>James Mwangi is CEO of Africa Climate Ventures and Anne-Marie Chidzero is CIO of FSD Africa Investments.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": ["African and global leaders are gathering in Nairobi for the Africa Climate Summit which opens on 4 September.

And while China has led the world in electric vehicle adoption and is investing heavily in renewable electricity, it is also building new coal-fired power plants as its emissions continue to rise.       </p><p>The science is clear, researchers say: nations must sharply cut greenhouse gases this decade to avoid the most catastrophic impacts from climate change. The warning signs are all around. Extreme weather is ravaging every continent. Biodiversity is collapsing and glaciers are melting. Billion dollar disasters are occurring regularly.       </p><p>\"The world is watching,\" a group of more than 650 scientists wrote in a Nov. 14 letter sent to President Biden by the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"This is a crucial moment for the United States to join with other world leaders and demonstrate genuine progress toward solving a crisis that is rapidly spiraling out of control.\"       </p><p>Part of the challenge is the design of the U.N. climate summits, where every country must sign off on an agreement, just one nation can sink a deal, and none of it is legally binding.       </p><p>\"We've had COPs for how many years now?\" said Avinash Persaud, a climate adviser for Barbados. \"If people had been compelled to act at COP1 or COP2 or COP15, we would have had a different world.\"       </p><p>Much of the progress in the fight against climate change has occurred outside the United Nations summits. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate law ever enacted in the United States, was the product of domestic politics, not a U.N. agreement. Europe's rapid build-out of wind and solar power is being driven by the war in Ukraine and efforts to abandon Russian oil and gas.       </p><p>Still, the COP process is the only vehicle where diplomats, corporate chiefs, princes and presidents come together to focus on a planetary crisis.       </p><p>\"This is probably the best format to discuss these types of global issues<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,\"</emphasis> said John Miller, an analyst who covers environmental policy for TD Cowen, the investment bank. \"There is progress at these events, but it's at a pace that's likely to disappoint<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis>That's not to say that the whole thing is a farce<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.\"</emphasis></p><p>This year, tensions are especially acute between the plodding pace of forward motion and the need to pivot more quickly away from fossil fuels.       </p><p>The United Arab Emirates, the host country, is one of the world's largest oil producers. And the man presiding over the event, Sultan Al Jaber, happens to be the head of Adnoc, the state-owned company that supplies 3 percent of the world's oil. He also runs the much smaller state-owned renewables company, Masdar.       </p><p>Some activists contend that the U.A.E.'s role as host, and Mr. Al Jaber's twin roles as oil executive and COP28 president, compromise the credibility of the conference. In the spring, more than 100 members of the U.S. Congress and European Parliament called for Mr. Al Jaber to be removed from the COP presidency, a position that rotates among countries each year.       </p><p>\"They went too far in naming the C.E.O. of one of the largest - and by many measures one of the dirtiest - oil companies on the planet as the president of the U.N. Conference on Climate this year,\" former vice president Al Gore said in an interview.       </p><p>An internal document obtained by the Centre for Climate Reporting and the BBC and made public this week showed that U.A.E.'s climate negotiators were given guidance to discuss the country's oil projects with representatives from other nations during COP28 meetings.       </p><p>At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Al Jaber dismissed the allegations as \"false, not true, incorrect and not accurate. I promise you never ever did I see these talking points that they refer to or that I ever even used such talking points in my discussions.\"       </p><p>Adding to the grievances are the unmet promises made last year at COP27, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Wealthy countries agreed to create a fund to compensate poor countries for destruction from climate disasters. But progress has been painstakingly slow. There has also been scant progress on efforts to overhaul the lending practices of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - which critics say can trap poor countries in a cycle of debt and disaster.       </p><p>This has left many developing countries mistrustful of the COP talks.       </p><p>\"They're bearing the consequences of climate change, which they did not create,\" said Mariana Mazzucato, an economist at University College London who is working to reform climate finance.       </p><p>In Dubai, leaders are expected to discuss their progress, or lack thereof, in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over preindustrial levels. That's the threshold beyond which scientists say that humans will have trouble adapting to intensifying wildfires, heat waves, drought and storms. In 2015 at the summit in Paris, countries agreed to cut emissions from burning coal, oil and gas to keep global warming \"well below 2 degrees Celsius\" and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.       </p><p>The planet has already warmed an average of 1.2 degrees Celsius.       </p><p>Negotiators are hoping to ratify the details of the loss and damage fund for poor countries, set new goals for reducing emissions and agree to better limit methane, a greenhouse gas that is 80 times as potent in the short term than carbon dioxide.       </p><p>Recent developments offer a flicker of hope. Two weeks ago, the U.S. and China, the world's two biggest polluters, agreed to accelerate efforts to ramp up renewables to displace fossil fuels, although they didn't provide a timeline or other details. And rich countries may have finally met a pledge to provide $100 billion per year to help developing countries adapt to climate change, albeit four years late, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said this month.       </p><p>Saleemul Huq was a Bangladeshi scientist who had attended every COP since the inaugural event in Berlin in 1995.

And, with only a few exceptions, they are not spending much on alternatives like wind and solar power and electric-car batteries.       </p><p>\"They are putting their money where their mouths are,\" said Larry Goldstein, director of special projects at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, a Washington nonprofit that specializes in oil, natural gas and petroleum products.       </p><p>Officials at the I.E.A., which the United States and its allies created during an oil crisis in the 1970s, think the oil companies are making a bad bet. They point to the stunningly fast growth in renewable energy and sales of electric cars, mopeds and other vehicles - one out of every five new vehicle sold this year will be battery-powered, up from one out of every 25 in 2020.       </p><p>\"The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and is unstoppable,\" said Fatih Birol, the agency's executive director.       </p><p>The kinds of energy that people and businesses use - and how they use it - over the next couple of decades will have huge environmental and economic consequences. Most climate scholars say eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, which are primarily caused by burning fossil fuels, by 2050 is essential to preventing the worst effects of climate change.       </p><p>Oil executives dismiss the I.E.A.'s projections, saying the world will need their products for a long time to come.       </p><p>\"I personally disagree, the majors disagree, OPEC disagrees, everybody that produces oil and gas disagrees,\" said Scott Sheffield, the chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, which Exxon agreed to buy for $60 billion two weeks ago. The I.E.A., Mr. Sheffield added, misunderstands \"the demand for our products.\"       </p><p>He went on: \"Who is going to replace jet fuel? Who is going to replace petrochemicals? What alternatives will replace all that?\"       </p><p>Buying Pioneer will expand Exxon's already very big presence in the Permian Basin, a large oil and gas rich area that straddles Texas and New Mexico. The deal more than doubles Exxon's properties in the basin.       </p><p>And Chevron's proposed acquisition of Hess is a giant bet on production in deep waters off the coast of Guyana, the fastest-growing oil prospect in the Western Hemisphere. The deal would make Chevron a junior partner of Exxon, the principal operator in the field.       </p><p>Both deals give the companies investments in fields where production costs are low and in areas that are largely stable, when future oil supplies from places like Russia and Venezuela are more in doubt.       </p><p>Oil executives are not oblivious to growing concerns about climate change. They say the consolidation will help them invest more in the relatively untested technology of capturing carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas, and burying it deep underground for perpetuity. They also say they intend to invest substantial sums in hydrogen, a potentially cleaner fuel.       </p><p>\"Consolidation at this point is about giving the companies the scale to be more resilient to meet various priorities at the same time,\" said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian who wrote about earlier waves of mergers in the oil industry in his book \"The Prize.\"       </p><p>Mr. Yergin said oil executives were being buffeted by conflicting forces. Most of their shareholders want them to keep churning out profits, while the Biden administration sends conflicting messages. The administration has at times asked oil companies to produce more oil and gas. But it has also limited drilling on federal lands and waters, and championed electric cars and other technologies meant to replace oil and gas.       </p><p>\"It's a very complicated time for oil companies,\" Mr. Yergin said. \"On the one hand, you have an administration asking them to increase production, and on the other hand you have the energy transition.\"       </p><p>But some energy experts see risks in the recent deals for the companies. Oil prices are relatively high right now at more than $80 a barrel. If prices fall sharply, a strong possibility if the I.E.A. is right about demand for oil and gas, oil companies will struggle financially.       </p><p>\"They are consolidating at the top of the market barring some temporary geopolitical crisis,\" said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University. \"Normally they consolidate at the bottom,\" when stock prices are cheaper, she said, such as in the 1990s when Exxon and Mobil merged.       </p><p>\"Not only are they investing at the top of the market,\" Ms. Jaffe added, \"they are also investing at a time when there is more uncertainty than in the 1990s concerning the long-term trajectory of oil demand.\"       </p><p>In the past, oil companies regretted some deals that were struck when energy prices were high. Exxon bought XTO, a natural gas company, in 2009 for $41 billion when gas prices had climbed to very high levels. After the deal closed, fracking produced a glut of gas and prices collapsed, forcing Exxon to write off most of its investment in XTO.       </p><p>The I.E.A. agrees that some demand for oil will persist for a while, but at much lower levels. That will drive down prices, making it harder for many companies to compete with large producers, like Saudi Arabia, that can produce oil at a very low cost.       </p><p>Oil executives agree that producing oil and gas at lower costs will be essential, and they argue that deals, such as Exxon's purchase of Pioneer and Chevron's acquisition of Hess, will help companies become more efficient. Mr. Sheffield of Pioneer said large European oil companies, like Shell and BP, would soon have to get bigger, too.       </p><p>\"There are too many public companies,\" Mr. Sheffield said. \"It's better for independents to consolidate into bigger companies. Energy security comes with larger companies.\"       </p><p>But one thing Mr. Sheffield and other executives are not interested in is straying too far from what they know best. With the exception of some European oil companies, like BP, Equinor and ENI, most businesses in the industry are not investing much in things like electric-vehicle charging, nuclear power, wind farms or batteries.       </p><p>Environmentalists like Mark Brownstein, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said big oil companies were missing an important opportunity to reinvent themselves.       </p><p>\"I look at this wave of mergers and acquisitions more as players in the industry trying to squeeze the last light out of the existing business model than as part of a transition to the future,\" Mr. Brownstein said. \"This is more about acquiring assets to continue to provide cash flow.\" </p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["Oil prices are relatively high right now at more than $80 a barrel.

In their Climate Finance Shadow Report released in June 2023, the organisation estimated that the annual average of non-concessional instruments in climate finance had reached $28 billion \u2013 42 percent \u2013 in 2019-20, while concessional lending remained largely on the same level as the previous two years.</p><p>Although MDBs accounted for much of this market-rate lending, a small number of wealthy countries continue to use loans as their main form of climate finance. Of all the bilateral providers, France leads the pack in lending, with a massive 92 percent of its bilateral public climate finance taking the form of loans.</p><p>And while a large share of that lending is made up of concessional or \"soft\" loans, which are offered at more favourable interest rates or longer repayment schedules, an alarming 17 percent of its bilateral climate finance is non-concessional. For Spain, that number is a staggering 85 percent. More than half of Austria's climate financing is non-concessional, according to Oxfam's analysis, as is almost a third of the United States' climate financing.</p><p>Paying back billions \u2013 with interest</p><p>Put together, this adds up to tens of billions of dollars every year that countries of the Global South will one day be forced to pay back to the world's wealthiest nations and development banks \u2013 with interest. And with global interest rates rising steeply, the cost of servicing those debts year after year will eat into the already-stretched budgets of countries buckling under the weight of debts that are getting harder to pay back.</p><p>Danielle Koh, policy analyst at the NGO Reclaim Finance, said that the problem partly arises from the sheer magnitude of the challenge of raising funds to tackle the climate crisis.</p><p>\"The scale of climate funding required is enormous,\" she said. \"To rely only on public financing would not be sufficient to meet 1.5\u00b0C pathway-aligned targets, and loans at market rates could attract and mobilise private capital.\"</p><p>By including loans at their full face value, Koh said, wealthy countries are also able to claim credit for meeting their climate pledges far beyond what they are actually giving away. Of the more than $83 billion that was claimed to have been raised in 2020, Oxfam estimates the actual value for developing countries to be between just $21 and $24 billion. And while non-concessional finance is not counted towards countries' official development assistance spending more broadly, this distinction has yet to be made when it comes to funding climate action.</p><p>\"In providing financing to developing countries, loans at market rates could be favoured because developed countries can count such loans towards being able to fulfil climate financing commitments while at the same time avoiding giving direct grants or other concessional types of financing, which would be more costly,\" said Koh.</p><p>Counting non-concessional loans as climate finance may not just be disingenuous, but dangerous. Sixty percent of low-income countries are already either in or on the verge of debt distress, forced to spend five times more every year on servicing their debts than they do on climate adaptation.</p><p>Counterproductive debt burden</p><p>Safa' Al Jayoussi, climate justice adviser at Oxfam Middle East and North Africa, said that adding to low-income countries' debt burden would make them more vulnerable, rather than more resilient, to the ravages of the climate crisis.</p><p>\"It's a big risk, because countries are already distressed,\" she said. \"Developing countries are dealing with a lot of loans from the World Bank and other institutions that are causing more austerity. Adding more pressure to the countries ... will impact those most vulnerable to climate change. This kind of funding is making adaptation and mitigation to climate change more difficult.\"</p><p>According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), public debt has been growing faster in developing nations than in their developed counterparts over the past decade. Faced with compounding crises of Covid-19, climate change and the cost-of-living crisis, the number of countries facing high levels of debt has increased dramatically, from just 22 countries in 2011 to 59 countries in 2022.</p><p>And debt is costing developing nations dearly. On average, African countries pay interest rates four times higher than those of the US, and eight times higher than Germany. To service those debts year after year, countries have little choice other than to redirect funds that may otherwise have gone to badly underfunded sectors such as health or education. In the ten years between 2010 and 2020, the number of countries where interest spending accounted for 10 percent or more of their public revenues rose from 29 to 55.</p><p>More debt, then, seems to be the last thing the developing world needs.</p><p>\"There is a real danger that this could lead to high debt burdens in developing countries,\" Koh said. \"With global rising interest rates, the cost of servicing debt for developing nations will rise substantially. Loans in foreign currencies could expose developing countries to soaring costs over servicing their debt in the case of exchange rate fluctuations or depreciations over time. In the long term, repaying climate debt not only diverts financial resources away from developing other sectors, but could lead to economic and fiscal instability.\"</p><p>Hans Peter Dejgaard, senior consultant at INKA Consult and a specialist in climate finance, said that while it made sense to finance some renewable energy infrastructure in middle-income developing countries through loans as commercially viable projects, too much reliance on loan-based financing would put poor countries in an impossible position if interest rates continued to rise.</p><p>He cited a World Bank loan of $400 million to the Philippines in early 2022 aimed at accelerating climate-related objectives. After the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates to just under 6 percent in April 2023 to fight rising inflation, he said, the total repayments that the Philippine government would have to make over a period of 20 years had potentially risen from $482 million to $686 million \u2013 a 42 percent increase.</p><p>\"This will affect their social and education budget,\" he said.</p><p>Reclaim Finance's Koh said that the cost for financing climate action should not be borne by the countries least able to afford it.</p><p>\"There is no 'one model fits all' when it comes to funding climate finance, but there are certain principles that we can rely on to guide our approach,\" she said. \"For example, that concessional financing and grants should be favoured over market-rate loans, whether through initiatives like the Loss and Damage Fund or others, to help developing countries build resources for climate adaptation and mitigation while avoiding increasing their debt burden.\"</p><p>For Al Jayoussi, that very burden should instead be borne by the countries most responsible for fuelling the worsening climate crisis.</p><p>\"Developing countries didn't even cause climate change,\" she said. \"We need to revamp and change the finance structure that caused climate change in the first place. We need grants and grant mechanisms for the most vulnerable countries, developing countries, to overcome climate change.\"</p>", "publisher": "FRANCE 24 (English)", "instances": ["Of the more than $83 billion that was claimed to have been raised in 2020, Oxfam estimates the actual value for developing countries to be between just $21 and $24 billion.

The flow of oil has grown by roughly 800,000 barrels a day since early 2022, and analysts expect the industry to add another 500,000 barrels a day next year.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The main driver of the production surge is a delayed response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which sent the price of oil to well over $100 a barrel for the first time in nearly a decade. The wells that were drilled last year are now in full swing.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the surge in output, gasoline prices have fallen by close to $2 a gallon since the summer of 2022 and are back to levels that prevailed in 2021. The increase in production has also provided the Biden administration with substantial leverage in its dealings with oil-exporting foes like Russia, Venezuela and Iran while reducing its need to cajole more friendly countries like Saudi Arabia to temper prices.       </p><p>But the comeback in U.S. oil production poses big risks, too. More supply and lower prices could increase demand for fossil fuels when world leaders, who are meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are straining to reach agreements that would accelerate the fight against climate change. Scientists generally agree that the world is far from achieving the goals necessary to avoid the catastrophic effects of global warming, which is caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal.       </p><p>\"We're achieving energy security and reducing inflation by leveraging high-emitting, carbon-intensive oil production,\" said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University. \"We're going to need to address that conflict.\"       </p><p>The United States now exports roughly four million barrels a day, more than any member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries except Saudi Arabia. On balance, the United States still imports more than it exports because domestic demand exceeds supply and many American refineries can more easily refine the heavier oil produced in Canada and Latin America than the lighter crude that oozes out of the shale fields of New Mexico, North Dakota and Texas.       </p><p>Nearly every extra barrel of American crude produced is being exported, mostly to Europe and Asia, where supplies are tight. In addition, the natural gas that often bubbles up with oil has led to record exports of gas and helped to lower prices for that fuel and for electricity, much of which is produced at gas-fired power plants in the United States.       </p><p>The surge in U.S. production has helped to end the energy crisis that gripped Europe after Russia invaded Ukraine - at least for now. European countries have replaced much of the gas they were buying from Russia with gas from the United States, Qatar and other exporters. They have also reduced their use of natural gas, a phenomenon that a mild winter last year helped.       </p><p>\"There is a foreign policy dividend in keeping a lid on oil prices,\" said David Goldwyn, who was a leading energy diplomat in the Obama administration.       </p><p>Not long ago, the U.S. oil industry was in deep trouble. It had suffered repeated busts since 2015, culminating in a collapse of prices during the pandemic. Investors fled. Exxon Mobil was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average, and some European oil companies announced plans to pivot from fossil fuels to renewables more quickly.       </p><p>With concerns over climate change growing, Joseph R. Biden Jr., during his 2020 presidential campaign, promised to stop drilling on federal lands and federal waters offshore. He also pledged to accelerate the transition to renewable energy and electric cars to drastically reduce the emissions responsible for climate change.       </p><p>But as president, Mr. Biden has taken a much different tack. While he has supported green energy and battery-powered cars, he has also hectored oil companies to increase production in an effort to drive down prices for consumers. He has approved a large drilling project in Alaska over the objections of environmentalists and a small number of offshore oil and gas permits.       </p><p>Mr. Biden has been under pressure from some Democrats to trumpet gains in oil production as a way of reaching out to voters who are leery of high gas prices. He has yet to do so - but his administration has not complained about the production, either.       </p><p>John Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the administration was committed to keeping energy prices low.       </p><p>\"The president is going to keep focusing, as he has been, on a healthy global market that's properly balanced and that can continue to bring the price of gasoline down here in the United States,\" Mr. Kirby said.       </p><p>The pandemic took a heavy toll on U.S. oil production, which fell to just over 11 million barrels a day at the end of 2020 from 13 million at the end a year earlier. Dozens of oil companies went out of business, and the number of rigs in use fell to 350 in 2020, from 800, as thousands of field workers lost their jobs.       </p><p>Most of the new U.S. oil production is coming from the Permian Basin, which straddles Texas and New Mexico. There are also some new projects and expansions in Alaska and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.       </p><p>\"It's the mother of all comeback stories,\" said Robert McNally, who was a senior energy adviser under President George W. Bush. \"The last couple of years have shown that you should never bet against the U.S. oil sector.\"       </p><p>The bonanza has helped American consumers. This week the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.25 a gallon, 25 cents below what it cost a year earlier and nearly $1.80 below the record price set in June 2022, according to AAA.       </p><p>But the benefits to the oil industry work force have been modest - the industry has added only about 8,000 jobs over the last year. There has been no repeat of the surge in oil and gas employment of a decade ago that brought an economic boom to small towns across Texas and North Dakota. That is because wells drilled through shale are established much faster now, with fewer workers required to run the rigs thanks to software improvements and robotics.       </p><p>The industry has also figured out ways to produce more oil and gas by lengthening the lateral wells that slash through hard shale rock, exposing more rock for fracture than was possible a few years ago.       </p><p>Of course, the current boom in production may not be sustained. The oil industry is very cyclical. And shale wells, in particular, are highly productive for only a couple of years, so a decline in drilling brings a quick, sharp decline in output. Conversely, a rapid return of drilling ignites a spurt of production.       </p><p>That said, price is what drives investment and production. Even when oil prices climbed past $100 a barrel after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the biggest companies like Exxon and Chevron decided not to significantly increase drilling because they feared a price collapse. Instead, the companies spent billions of dollars buying back shares and handing out dividends.       </p><p>By late 2022, however, smaller public companies and hundreds of privately owned firms began ramping up operations. Many small companies were bought by larger firms, which also spurred more production.       </p><p>\"The independents were back close to prepandemic activity,\" said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. \"And the privates just went crazy.\"       </p><p>Mr. LeBlanc said the investments made during the second half of last year were now bearing fruit. He predicted that American production could rise to 13.7 million barrels a day by the end of 2024, unless there is a deep recession and prices drop around $10 to below $65 a barrel.       </p><p>\"I am very surprised by how much we have produced this year,\" said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Permian Basin producer that Exxon is acquiring. He predicted that the country could produce 15 million barrels a day in five years.       </p><p>Production is also growing in Canada, Guyana, Brazil and Norway.       </p><p>Mr. Sheffield said \"the big question\" was how Saudi Arabia might respond if production in the United States and other countries continued to rise.       </p><p>As the leader of OPEC Plus, a group of 23 oil-producing countries, which together produce nearly half the world's oil, Saudi Arabia could eventually pressure its allies to flood the market with oil in an effort to sharply drive down prices. That would drive U.S. companies out of business or force them to sharply lower production.       </p><p>Investors have recently grown more fond of oil, and the stocks of Exxon, Chevron and other companies are up a lot over the last two years. But that could be changing. The price of oil has been falling recently and is down by more than 15 percent since the summer.       </p><p>Mr. Sheffield said the drastic swings in energy prices were a main reason that investors were wary of his industry. \"The reason for the lack of investor interest is the volatility of our business,\" he said. \"Discipline is not out the window, but we need to solve this volatility issue and I don't know when we are going to solve it.\"       </p><p>Jim Tankersley contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jim Tankersley contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. </emphasis></p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["But the comeback in U.

From the controversial Emirati host Sultan al-Jaber to climate leader and Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados, FRANCE 24 takes a look at some of the likely protagonists of the high-stakes gathering.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The COP28 climate summit kicks off in the desert metropolis on Thursday, November 30, drawing representatives of almost 200 countries as well as a host of climate experts, activists and lobbyists. Some 70,000 delegates are expected to attend the 13-day gathering, which will be the largest \u2013 and, arguably, most controversial \u2013 COP to date.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The high-stakes summit in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates will be closely scrutinised, with tough negotiations on fossil fuels and climate financing on the agenda. A number of high-profile figures will be in the spotlight, none more so than the event's Emirati president and host, Sultan al-Jaber.</p><p>Sultan Al-Jaber, a Trojan horse at the helm? </p><p>News that COP28 would be headed by the host country's oil supremo immediately sparked a firestorm of criticism. At 50, the Emirati industry minister is an habitu\u00e9 of climate negotiations, having already led his country's delegations at COP26 in Glasgow and the following gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh. The founder of renewable energies firm Masdar, he likes to tout his credentials as the face of clean energy in the UAE.</p><p>But al-Jaber is also the chief executive of Adnoc, the country's state oil company \u2013 a title many climate activists say disqualifies him from chairing a summit aimed at combating the global warming caused in large part by fossil fuels.</p><p>The COP28 president bristles at accusations that he has a conflict of interest. \"I'm someone who spent the majority of his career in sustainability, in sustainable economic development and project management, and renewable energy,\" he told AFP in July.</p><p>He has managed to soothe a number of sceptics in the build-up to the summit, including Harjeet Singh of the influential coalition Climate Action Network International, which brings together some 1,900 NGOs.</p><p>\"He's very straightforward, he's open to listening,\" Singh told AFP this week, though cautioning that the pair \"agree to disagree\" on several issues.</p><p>A first turning point came at a June conference in Bonn, Germany, when al-Jaber described the reduction of fossil fuels as \"inevitable\" \u2013 an unprecedented step for a Gulf official. The next month, the Adnoc CEO reiterated in a letter to COP28 parties that \"phasing down demand for, and supply of, all fossil fuels is inevitable and essential\", setting out ambitious targets for renewable energies and climate financing.</p><p>Just days before the summit's opening, however, al-Jaber's position was weakened by a BBC report revealing that the UAE planned to use its role as the host of UN climate talks as an opportunity to strike oil and gas deals \u2013 allegations he promptly denied.</p><p>\"This is exactly the kind of conflict of interest we feared when the CEO of an oil company was appointed to the role,\" Greenpeace's climate policy head Kaisa Kosonen wrote in a post on the social media network X.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether al-Jaber will be able to influence/guide/lead the nearly 200 states taking part in the summit to broker an agreement on an ambitious text.

She notably spearheaded successful efforts to establish a Loss and Damage Fund, designed to provide financial assistance to nations most vulnerable and impacted by the effects of climate change.</p><p>Mottley, 58, also played a key part in a summit held in Paris last June for a new global financial pact. The gathering hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron aimed to achieve greater climate justice by writing off the debt of less-developed countries, setting up a guarantee fund backed by development banks and the International Monetary Fund and taxing the profits of fossil fuel companies.</p><p>Her inspirational advocacy earned her a place on TIME magazine's list of The 100 Most Influential People of 2022. Writing in the magazine, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, said Mia Mottley \"is an embodiment of our conscience, reminding us all to treat our planet and therefore one another with love, dignity, and care\".</p><p>Such is Mottley's rising fame and prestige that her name has reportedly been floated among possible candidates to head the United Nations after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, whose mandate will come to an end in 2026.</p><p>Xie Zhenhua, China's veteran climate negotiator </p><p>Known as China's \"Mr Climate\", Xie Zhenhua has represented the world's top CO2 emitter at every COP since 2007, making him a centrepiece of all recent climate negotiations. He was notably involved in hammering out the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015.</p><p>An engineer by training, the 74-year-old official has been at the head of the State Environmental Protection Administration since 1993 and is known for his diplomatic skills. In recent years, he has succeeded in forging a close relationship with his American counterpart John Kerry, the US climate envoy, despite the wider context of tense relations between the two superpowers.</p><p>The personal rapport between Xie and Kerry will be all the more important in the absence of the two countries' presidents, the White House having confirmed on Monday that President Joe Biden will not attend COP28.</p><p>\"Xie Zhenhua is a model for future climate diplomats,\" former Greenpeace activist Li Shuo, now a researcher at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told AFP. \"He is deeply committed to climate action and shows a willingness and ability to bridge the gap between China and the global community.\"</p><p>Brazil's Marina Silva, guardian of the Amazon</p><p>A former presidential candidate, Brazil's Environment Minister Marina Silva is an emblematic figure of the fight against deforestation in the Amazon. After four years of unprecedented destruction of the world's largest rainforest under former president Jair Bolsonaro, she has made it her mission to save the so-called \"lungs of the planet\".</p><p>Silva served as environment minister during President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's first term in office, between 2003 and 2008. She was reappointed to the job in January, following Lula's defeat of his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro. Since then, she has secured a European Union commitment to invest \u20ac260 million in an Amazon Fund that Bolsonaro's government had suspended.</p><p>She is expected to push further at COP28, accompanied by Lula, with a proposal to set up a new fund to preserve tropical rainforests in some 80 countries. Speaking at a seminar in the run-up to the summit, Silva said the initiative would involve \"a mechanism of payment per standing tree and per hectare of land\" to help countries preserve their forests.</p><p>Inez Umuhoza Grace, the voice of ecofeminism</p><p>Aside from the official country delegations, COP28 will draw a host of civil-society activists determined to weigh on the discussions. They include Ineza Umuhoza Grace, founder of Rwandan NGO The Green Protector, a women-led non-profit that aims to foster environmental awareness among youths.</p><p>Umuhoza Grace, 27, is global coordinator for the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, which brings together young people from the global South and North to demand action on helping countries most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>In an interview with the NGO Global Impact, Umuhoza Grace recalled how she first experienced the effects of the climate crisis at an early age when her family home in Rwanda was destroyed due to intensive rainfall and wind. It was only years later that she was able to link this formative experience to the changing climate.</p><p>\"I was watching the news one evening and then I saw on the television a particular area in my country where the community was being forced to move because of flooding and erosion,\" she said. \"On the television you could see that most of the people who were being displaced were women and children. And that reminded me of the powerless feeling that I had back then.\"</p><p>Umuhoza Grace studied environmental engineering at the University of Rwanda and describes herself as an \"ecofeminist\". Her work focuses on advocacy and training, both petitioning global leaders at international events and sharing the science of climate change at the grassroots level.</p><p>\"Everyone, everywhere is exposed (to the climate crisis),\" she told Global Impact. \"Everyone is vulnerable, but the level of vulnerability depends on the level of infrastructure already in place, the educational system, the funds and finance.\"</p><p>Her youth coalition plans to present 10 demands at COP28, including the full implementation of the Loss and Damage Fund that Barbados PM Mia Mottley successful pushed for at the COP27 gathering last year.</p><p>This article has been translated from the original in French.</p>", "publisher": "FRANCE 24 (English)", "instances": ["Who will stand up in the name of all those who have died because of the climate crisis or will stand up for the small island developing states who need [to keep global warming below] 1. 5\u00b0 Celsius to survive?

Funds have been promised, she concedes, but 'the money needs to go where it's most needed.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Revolutionising international finance to save the planet and eradicate poverty was the ambition of the summit for a new global financial pact held in Paris on 22 and 23 June, under the aegis of Emmanuel Macron. 'We do not have to choose between poverty and the climate,' declared the French President on 21 May 2022 at COP27 in Egypt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, according to researchers from the Loss and Damage Collaboration group, 97% of those affected by extreme climatic events live in developing countries. To meet the costs incurred, their needs are staggering: $27trn, according to Oxfam, an NGO. That's why activists from the continent continue to raise their voices. Among them is Adenike Oladosu, a 29-year-old Nigerian who pioneered the Fridays for Future movement.</p><p>Is Africa condemned to choose between development and environmental preservation?</p><p>Adenike Oladosu: In Nigeria, for example, some of our leaders still believe we need fossil fuels to develop. I think climate action can help us develop. The fossil fuel industry might generate billions of dollars in profit, but it also negatively impacts communities and entire countries.</p><p>We often forget that innovation, environmental and energy responsibility and climate financing can also generate numerous benefits. Investing in renewable energy could triple the number of jobs and simultaneously generate positive social and gender equality benefits. In the long run, fossil fuels are not a solution.</p><p>Are African countries doing what they should? Is Nigeria, for instance, a large producer of oil, living up to the challenges?</p><p>No, African countries are not adequately addressing the climate emergency, but it's also a question of capacity. We need to implement innovations like smart agriculture, consider our energy transition, and work on projects like refilling Lake Chad.</p><p>But how do we acquire the necessary resources? How do we develop our capacities? On paper, every country has plans, but what we need are concrete actions. The money needs to go where it is most needed.</p><p>In Nigeria, the government has decided to stop subsidising the oil sector. But where will these subsidies go? I can only hope our government will do what is necessary to redirect them towards renewable energy sources to make them more affordable.</p><p>Can the new global financial pact outlined in Paris be a solution?</p><p>All the commitments and promises that have been made are a step forward. It's undoubtedly very positive to see that we can allocate millions to tackle the climate crisis. But it should not just be all talk, that won't be enough. These funds need to materialise, and action is needed. We need to know how these funds will be unlocked and how they will be distributed.</p><p>We can't be satisfied with gathering people from all over the world and merely talking without really moving things forward. We can't forget that we sometimes have very different challenges and that Africa cannot be spoken about as a homogenous entity. We are talking about dozens of distinct countries, each requiring funding.</p><p>What are the most urgent actions to be implemented on the continent?</p><p>Everything is urgent, and all sectors need dedicated funding because climate change doesn't just have environmental impacts, but also on agriculture or even real estate. Faced with climate challenges, we absolutely need to innovate.</p><p>One example is Lake Chad, which has significantly shrunk since the 1960s. If we do not act, if we do not find a way to replenish it with water, it will be a disaster, affecting the entire region. The drying up of the lake already poses significant food insecurity problems. If we do nothing, this situation could lead to a conflict more severe than the war in Ukraine. This isn't just a regional problem; it's a global one, as the resulting migrations will also affect Europe.</p><p>As a climate activist, do you feel like you're finally being heard?</p><p>There have been changes, despite everything. In Nigeria, for example, the long-awaited law on climate change was enacted. At COP27 in Egypt, funds for loss and damage were approved. This shows that we can pressure our leaders to act, and we're not about to stop.</p><p>What's encouraging is that there's a greater awareness among the population than a few years ago. In Nigeria, for example, people are much more aware of these issues than when I started my fight in 2018.</p><p>But it also means we've been campaigning for climate justice for years, and that shouldn't be the case.

Since most of them are located in the tropics, they are naturally more likely to experience extreme weather conditions or natural disasters, phenomena that are further amplified by the climate upheavals we are living through. </p><p>These countries are also more vulnerable, as they have fewer resources at their disposal to adapt to climate change and its consequences, and to protect their populations.\u00a0</p><p>They are the hardest hit, but yet they are also those which contribute least to climate change and its acceleration. With 20% of the world's population, Africa only produces 4% of the world's annual CO2 emissions. </p><p>More generally, the World Bank shows that each resident in high-income countries produces an average of 10 tonnes of CO2 per year. For people living in low-income countries it is under 0.5 tonnes/year, and under four for those in middle-income countries. These are crucial issues, and I am delighted that they are finally being addressed at a dedicated summit.</p><p>Coincidentally, another summit is being held this week in the United Kingdom: the Ukraine Recovery Conference. It is extraordinary to witness that, in 14 months, more than (EURO)151 billion in military, financial and humanitarian aid have been mobilised for Ukraine, with global military spending reaching a record level of US$240 billion last year. What the Ukrainian people are going through is indescribable. The international community must continue to support them and help them to defend themselves.</p><p>This support demonstrates a strong political commitment, a common will which enables us to achieve great things. We need the same will and determination to fight against climate change, drought, desertification and biodiversity loss.</p><p>The consequences of climate change may often seem less clear than those of war, but the truth is that climate change also kills and shatters lives. 30% of the world's population is already exposed to deadly heatwaves. This has been the case in India over the last few days. In less than 80 years' time, during our children's or grandchildren's lifetimes, more than three-quarters of the world's population could be similarly affected.</p><p>Rising temperatures are also increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts, leading to more natural disasters: wildfires, as is currently the case in Canada, storms and floods. These phenomena claim many victims and leave indelible scars.</p><p>Ultimately, drought and natural disasters disrupt ecosystems and farming. In turn, they exacerbate food insecurity and lead to water shortages. Almost a third of the world's population is already facing water stress. In less than 30 years, it could be 60%. </p><p>Over the same timescale, the World Bank predicts that more than 216 million people could be forced to migrate to escape famine or lack of water. These major population movements will have an impact on the political stability of many countries and could further upset the current geopolitical balance.</p><p>This is not about trying to compare or rank suffering. It's about joining forces and taking action. More than 20 years ago, French President Jacques Chirac said at the Earth Summit: \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Our house is burning and we are looking the other way</emphasis>\". </p><p>This is literally what is happening. Developing countries are on the front line in the war against climate change, the first victims. We need to support them, help them to face up to the challenge, find innovative solutions, and develop in ways other than by making the same mistakes as industrialised countries did.</p><p>I have faith. I know that political will is the key to overcoming major challenges. I firmly believe in the commitment and creativity of young people and communities who have already invented many solutions to make themselves more resilient or develop new ways of farming. </p><p>Our role, as political decision-makers, institutions and private investors, is to help communities and project leaders find the resources they need to put these ideas into practice as quickly as possible.</p><p>The Great Green Wall, for instance, is a huge opportunity for sub-Saharan Africa and for the world. This pan-African initiative aims to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land in Africa, along an 8,000 km strip south of the Sahara, stretching from Senegal to Djibouti. This brings together numerous projects developed by communities and adapted to local needs. </p><p>Overall, the Great Green Wall requires over $43 billion in funding. Several pledges of support have already been made. For this project, as for all those that can help reverse the trend and preserve the Earth, we need to join forces and demonstrate unprecedented political will.</p><p>This upcoming Summit should provide an opportunity to do just that.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["Political will is the most important weapon in our arsenal to tackle this issue, writes Alain-Richard Donwahi.

From Beaumont-sur-Oise to Minneapolis, a perfect storm of crises has focused attention on the most basic of human needs: the oxygen-filled air that sustains life, keeps coronavirus patients breathing, and which George Floyd was fatally denied.</p><p>In France, the chilling video footage of Floyd's killing on May 25 by a police officer in Minneapolis promptly evoked comparisons with the unresolved case of Traor\u00e9, whose last words were also, \"I can't breathe\".</p><p>Two autopsies and four separate medical examinations have offered conflicting reasons for Traor\u00e9's death in police custody, with his family maintaining that he suffocated under the weight of the three officers who used a controversial technique to restrain him. None of the officers has been charged, and the seething sense of injustice has fuelled the family's struggle against racism and police violence in France's deprived banlieues.</p><p>\"No man, no person should die like that, at that age,\" said Traor\u00e9's sister Assa, who has led the family's long legal fight. \"There's a huge number of names \u2013\u00a0they are immigrants, they are people from poor neighbourhoods, they are Black, Arab, non-white \u2013\u00a0who are killed by police.\"</p><p>Leftists and Yellow Vests</p><p>Saturday's broad-based march was the result of years of community organising by the Traor\u00e9 family, backed by veteran anti-racism campaigners who joined their advocacy group, Truth For Adama, commonly referred to as the Comit\u00e9 Adama.</p><p>Galvanised by the global protest movement that followed Floyd's killing in the US, the Comit\u00e9 Adama drew tens of thousands of protesters to the streets of Paris last month in France's biggest \u2013\u00a0and most diverse \u2013\u00a0such rallies in decades. Its protests have dwarved those staged by older anti-racism groups, whose radical edge has been eroded by years of association with mainstream political parties.</p><p>&gt;&gt;\u00a0As George Floyd outrage spreads, France confronts its own demons</p><p>The group has \"succeeded in carrying countless feelings of injustice that were yet to find an outlet\",\u00a0says Julien Tulpin, a sociologist at the National Centre for Scientific Research. \"In doing so, it has mobilised well beyond the circle of everyday activists.\"</p><p>Since her brother's death, Assa Traor\u00e9 has roamed the country to meet with bereaved families, address rallies, reach out to other advocacy groups, and challenge political parties to take an interest in the banlieues. Last year, she invited representatives of the Yellow Vests, a largely white anti-government protest movement, to the annual gathering in Beaumont-sur-Oise.</p><p>While some groups, including the leftist \"antifa\" (anti-fascists), have made for natural bedfellows, other tentative allies, like the Yellow Vests, have raised more than a few eyebrows in a country where rural folk and banlieue residents seldom cross paths.</p><p>Even as they reach out for partners, members of the Comit\u00e9 Adama have fiercely defended their autonomy, speaking of \"alliances\" rather than \"convergence\". They have been especially wary of involvement with political parties, careful to distinguish themselves from older anti-racism organisations, established in the 1980s and largely controlled by the Socialist and Communist parties that once dominated left-wing activism.</p><p>\"The Comit\u00e9 Adama is willing to engage with political parties on the left, to challenge and provoke them, but it is careful to keep its distance,\" said Tulpin, noting that many left-wing parties in the French Republican tradition are reluctant to acknowledge the \"systemic, institutionalised racism\" denounced by the Comit\u00e9 Adama.</p><p>Ecology for all</p><p>So far, Alternatiba has proved a good match. Both movements are young, radical, independent and driven by women. In the words of Nac\u00e9, Alternatiba's spokeswoman, they also share a \"systemic approach, aimed at overcoming a system of racial and gender-based domination that oppresses the most vulnerable\".</p><p>\"There's a common strategy and a common ideological bedrock,\" Tulpin agrees.</p><p>\"On the one hand, they agree to support one another in their respective, autonomous fights,\" he explains. \"And on the other, they share the assessment that the principal victims of racism, pollution and climate change are the underprivileged.\"</p><p>Finally, Tulpin adds, \"they also believe that the mainstream left has abandoned those segments of the population and ignored the discriminations they endure.\"</p><p>In March 2019, when hundreds of thousands of climate campaigners marched in towns and cities across France to denounce government inaction, in the country's largest ever climate protests, Assa Traor\u00e9 chose to march separately, under the Truth For Adama banner. But she accepted Alternatiba's invitation to address the crowd, and later returned the invitation with Saturday's gathering in Beaumont-sur-Oise.</p><p>For Alternatiba, a key aim of the rally was to dispel the widely-held belief that environmentalism is solely a preoccupation of white middle classes from the city-centres.</p><p>\"Ecology should not only be for the wealthy, organic-eating urbanites. It is also about solidarity and reclaiming one's territory,\" says Mac\u00e9, noting that France's poor suburbs, home to large immigrant and non-white populations living in cramped, neglected housing projects, are the most impacted by climate change, by polluted air and water.</p><p>\"The Adama Generation and the Climate Generation have come together to denounce a same system that plunders resources and pushes the most vulnerable further down the ladder,\" she says. \"We want a different type of society based on justice and equality, and none of this will be possible without bringing poor, working-class districts on board.\"</p>", "publisher": "FRANCE 24 (English)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 37, "title": "Environment - G7 nations pledge ambitious goals for fossil fuel

Sunak's words followed those of French President Emmanuel Macron, who warned the world should not sacrifice its climate commitments because of Russia's invasion nor allow its attention to be diverted from the climate emergency by the food and energy crises. Russia's aggression against Ukraine has not only brought the war to European soil but it has also brought uncertainty and tension to the world,\" Macron said, adding it had inflicted \"difficulty upon difficulty\" on Africa and the Mediterranean. But wealthy countries must live up to their climate commitments, Macron added, promising that energy savings \u2013 and the acceleration of renewables and nuclear power \u2013 remained a priority for France."]}, {"relevance_score": 3, "title": "\"The Future is in our hands: Our chance to shape the Conference on the Future of Europe\" Opinion by Xabier Macias, President of Coppieters Foundation [Promoted content]", "published": "2021-12-07", "bodyText": "<p>Social movements and minority groups are at the periphery of the centres of power.

To date, no one has been convicted for organising this mass violence.</p><p>Many of the land disputes are rooted in the colonial regime that facilitated and privileged the European settlers. And then in the post-independence era, Kenya's elite struck deals with the outgoing colonial officials and allocated themselves ownership of prime farm and residential land.</p><p>Yet in the national elections due on 9 August, land is hardly featuring in the rival campaigns.

Those disputes most commonly target Kikuyu people who hold land outside their ancestral home of CentralKenya.</p><p>For the first time since the return of multi-party politics in 1992, there is no Kikuyu candidate running for president on the ticket of one of the big parties.</p><p>This means the Kikuyu vote will split; it will be the swing vote this year. So without a Kikuyu presidential candidate, party campaigners believe they have little to gain from making land justice a flashpoint issue this time around.</p><p>Second, William Ruto's campaign has tried to frame this election ages with its 'hustler vs. dynasties' narrative.</p><p>It is a cross-ethnic campaign which finds support among Kikuyus too and well as Ruto's own Kalenjin base in the Rift Valley. The hustler theme has made the economy - especially for informal workers, small time traders, and landless people \u00ad\u00ad- the major campaign issue.</p><p>'What's on everyone's mind right now is that economy is in the middle of a meltdown,' John Githongo,  the former anti-corruption czar who runs Inuka Trust, tells The Africa Report.</p><p>'People are worried about the cost of living, unemployment and corruption. We have a parallel dollar market for the first time since the 1990s. The country is in an extremely precarious economic position.'</p><p>Ruto's 'Hustler narrative' tries to respond to these anxieties. Supporters say one of its core principles is that everyone deserves to prosper - that is regardless of whether they own or have access to land. Yet the reality is that most wealthy Kenyans have used the acquisition or inheritance of land as a building block to prosperity.</p><p>This could reduce the urgency of the land justice issue this year.</p><p>Ruto also needs to nurture his Kikuyu supporters, says Githongo, so 'the tactic of flaring up the land question - which frequently is code for targeting Kikuyus outside Central Kenya - wouldn't work at all.'</p><p>Third, as Raila Odinga, one of the strongest campaigners on land rights, has been endorsed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his family (one of the country's largest landowners), the land question seems to have fallen off the radar. That may also undercut Raila's credibility as an advocate for land justice.</p><p>'Land justice isn't a strong tactic for the Odinga campaign,' says economist Kwame Owino.

While the times of war increased the risks for infection, civil society is showing dedication to addressing the rising health concerns.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was 1st June when a medical van stopped at Lozova, in Kharkiv oblast, Eastern Ukraine. Prior to Russia's invasion, Lozova was home to 50,000 people - though the war has displaced over 30% of the country's population, either internally or beyond Ukraine's borders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the van stopped in the town, people started gathering around. The van is one of the six vans from the Alliance for Public Health in Ukraine that operate with medical teams aiming to address medical needs in the frontline territories as well as providing testing of viral infections.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During rapid testing for viral hepatitis C, two positive results were recorded - one for a 40-year-old woman, and the other for her 45-year-old husband. The following day another case was reported for a 37-year-old man in a different city - Shevchenkiv.\u00a0</p><p>The unifying factor for the likelihood of infection, according to Iryna Filenko, a social worker of the Blago Foundation, was the local dentist in Kupyansk that they visited in the past six months.\u00a0</p><p>\"Perhaps the infection occurred there because this city is 8 km from the front. Frequent artillery fire. Frequent power outages. In the zone of active hostilities, non-compliance with the rules of instrument sterilisation is possible,\" Filenko explained to EURACRIV.</p><p>The example Filenko gave encapsulates how wartimes increase the spread of viruses, such as hepatitis C. While sharing drug injection equipment is the driving risk for the virus spread, wartimes create new ways and new risk groups.</p><p>\"In terms of injecting drug use, the risks remain as they were but they are higher now because people taking less care about sterility,\" Tetiana Deshko, director of International Programs at Alliance for Public Health in Ukraine, told EURACTIV at the EASL liver congress in Vienna, Austria.\u00a0</p><p>But frontlines create further risk groups, as there is a lot of blood contact among the military.</p><p>\"I have to say military people are now so much affected by hepatitis,\" Deshko said, adding that so far there are no statistics on this available.\u00a0</p><p>\"We think that this is one of the gaps that the country would soon have to address more significantly,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>Another risk group are sex workers, whose number increased in the frontline areas, according to Deshko, as destroyed industries have led to reduced employment opportunities.</p><p>Taking the increased risks of hepatitis spread into account, Ukraine is in a particularly difficult situation as \"even before the war the situation with hepatitis was very challenging in Ukraine\". In the opening press conference of the EASL liver congress, Deshko said that an estimated 5% of the adult population lives with hepatitis C infection.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's 1.3 million people, it's a massive population,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>Moreover, as viral hepatitis does not show symptoms until serious health complications occur, only one in 10 people infected with the hepatitis C virus are aware of their condition, Deshko said. Because of this, the disease is known as the \"silent killer\".</p><p>Deshko's organisation, the International Programs at Alliance for Public Health, responds to HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis, going closer to communities with mobile units to ensure linkage to care to the risk groups. Since the war started, they also provide humanitarian help and general healthcare.\u00a0</p><p>The group operates in frontline territories with a team of a doctor, a nurse, a social worker, and a driver. Among a number of medical tests available, they provide hepatitis C testing, as well as basic medications and hygiene products.</p><p>\"First, you see no one,\" Deshko started telling how the situation is when visiting with the mobile units.\u00a0</p><p>\"After 10 minutes, people start coming out from underground of their houses.

Especially men - when they offered rapid testing for hepatitis C, they would rather say no,\" Deshko said.</p><p>\"But if they are coming for humanitarian aid to get some things which are necessary for the home, while they are standing in the queue, there is time to persuade the person a little bit and really kind of motivate them to seek medical advice as well.\"\u00a0</p><p>However, diagnosis does not ensure treatment and with the majority of Ukraine's budget dedicated to war, the situation still runs up against difficulties.</p><p>The Ukrainian government used to procure medications for treating between 16,000 and 18,000 patients with hepatitis C annually. However, currently, as 60% of the national budget is the war budget, according to Deshko, the number of treated patients was reduced to about 12,000 in 2022.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is largely because there are not enough medications to treat people and there are just too many structural barriers, populations are moving across the country.

Only four countries - Italy, Spain, Germany and France - account for 75% of the cases. According to the ECDC, the causes of this increase are not clear, but it identifies some factors that can contribute to it, like changes in national testing policies, ageing population, conditions of water systems and changes in climate.

But unlike other protesters, some of whom had always been anti-establishment, Ms. Yamin had spent most of her life not only believing in the system but working at its top levels.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"My life and my work is a dance between an insider and an outsider,\" she said.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her experience as an insider goes back more than 30 years. Ms. Yamin, 57, is an internationally recognized environmental lawyer and a respected adviser to developing countries and small island nations like the Marshall Islands, working on their behalf at the international level.       </p><p>She is also a leading author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and was a key architect of the Paris climate agreement. Ms. Yamin is widely seen as responsible for securing, through behind-the-scenes diplomacy, a central element of the pact: The goal of net-zero emissions by midcentury.       </p><p>After the agreement, though, as Donald J. Trump rose to power in the United States and other countries continually delayed strong action on climate change, she said her faith in institutions began to crumble.       </p><p>\"I was na\u00efve about what we could achieve,\" Ms. Yasmin said of her intellectual journey. \"I've learned we cannot rely on lawyers and diplomats alone.\"       </p><p>That journey started when Ms. Yamin was studying law in her 20s. Growing up as a Pakistani immigrant in England who experienced racism, Ms. Yamin knew she wanted to spend her career fighting injustice. When she embarked on an internship with a small environmental law firm in 1991 as a recent Oxford graduate, Ms. Yamin knew she had found her calling. \"I never looked back,\" she said. \"I was optimistic.\"       </p><p>Since then, Ms. Yamin has attended nearly every major international climate conference, but she is best known for her work at the negotiations that led to the Paris Agreement.       </p><p>She had spent years working with academics, civil society groups and lawyers to make net-zero emissions - the idea of using reductions, carbon capture and carbon offsets to ensure that no additional greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere - the rallying call of the 2015 conference. \"Farhana was among a handful of collaborators who was willing to step up and champion this quest,\" said Bernice Lee, a research director on sustainability at Chatham House, a London research organization.       </p><p>But just months after Ms. Yamin achieved one of the biggest victories of her career, she said, things took a turn for the worse. By 2016, some Western countries were seeing a rise of nationalism and a growing distrust of international institutions, with Britain voting to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump threatening to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement if elected.       </p><p>\"I felt that the whole multilateral world, the international framework for human rights, was just collapsing around me,\" Ms. Yamin said.       </p><p>When, from a meeting room at a United Nations climate conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, Ms. Yamin watched Mr. Trump win the election, she was despondent. She felt that her 30-year career as a government lawyer and climate negotiator had amounted to nothing.       </p><p>\"All of it was going up in smoke,\" she said. \"I couldn't tell my clients, I couldn't lie to the Marshall Islands, that we would fix this.\" Ms. Yamin took a year off, spending most of her time in nature therapy classes and camping in the wilderness for weeks at a time.       </p><p>During her time off, Ms. Yamin began reading about other social movements, like the anti-apartheid campaign and the suffragist movement, that used social mobilization and nonviolent resistance to advance their causes. \"I felt that the climate movement was almost unique and fragile, relying mostly on insider tactics and not on movement building,\" she said. \"It wasn't relying on the full sets of tools.\"       </p><p>It was this idea that reignited Ms. Yamin's passion for climate and helped her get back to work. Instead of returning to climate diplomacy, Ms. Yamin joined the nascent Extinction Rebellion movement, a decentralized group that uses nonviolent action and civil disobedience, in 2018.       </p><p>Initially, Ms. Yamin became the leader of Extinction Rebellion's political team, using her knowledge of the diplomatic terrain to help the movement be more strategic in its activism and get more funding. Even in her new activist role, though, Ms. Yamin felt she was relying too heavily on her intellectual skills instead of putting her body on the line. When an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was issued in October 2018, Ms. Yamin was reading the report as activists filled Parliament Square in London.

How to fill the gap - and compete on par with the US and China - will be a central theme for the 2024 European elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen took many by surprise <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/commission-president-eu-sovereignty-fund-will-be-proposed-in-summer/\">when she announced last year</url> that the EU executive would table a proposal for a European \"sovereignty fund\" before the summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We want European industry to keep leading in the green transition. This is why I introduced\u00a0the idea of a sovereignty fund,\" von der Leyen said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_22_7727\">speech</url> to Parliament on the eve of an EU leaders' summit on 15 December.</p><p>\"We need to galvanise our strong European industrial power in the global fight against climate change. And that calls for common European industrial policy with common European funding,\" she added, saying the Commission would table a proposal \"around summer\" as part of a wider EU mid-term budgetary review.</p><p>The result, as many had feared, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-commission-wants-new-technology-fund-but-no-fresh-cash-in-sight/\">was underwhelming</url>.</p><p>Instead of a mighty sovereignty fund, the EU executive did what it knows best and unveiled a new website with a new acronym, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/strategic-technologies-europe-platform_en#:~:text=STEP%20seeks%20to%20reinforce%2C%20leverage,quality%20label%20for%20sovereignty%20projects.\">Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP)</url>.</p><p>More importantly, there was no extra money on the table to rival the US Inflation Reduction Act and its $370 billion in cash for clean energy investments. Instead, the Commission chief said the money will be rehashed from existing EU funds, with a proposed (EURO)10 billion top-up coming from EU member states' coffers.</p><p>Even if EU countries agree to the proposed budgetary top-up - <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FT/status/1671138396197072896?s=20\">which looks uncertain at best</url> - the EU's green industrial policy budget will look miserable compared to the hundreds of billions put forward by the US and China.</p><p>\"We have limited budgets,\" von der Leyen said, as if admitting defeat.</p><p>The fundamental reasons behind this are well known. While poorer EU countries want a fund allowing them to catch up with the rest of the EU, \"richer member states - who might be expected to benefit most since they have more start-ups - may not see the need for such a fund,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/european-sovereignty-fund-commissions-best-chance-or-empty-shell/\">said Zach Meyers, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform (CER)</url>.</p><p>At the end of the day, too many countries were against the idea of holding another round of budgetary talks, which are always divisive at the EU level.</p><p>While France has backed the idea of a large fund financed by common European debt, other member states <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/german-finance-ministry-firmly-rejects-new-eu-common-debt/\">like Germany</url> and the Netherlands argue there is still plenty of unused cash in the EU's (EURO)800 billion COVID-19 recovery fund.</p><p>The resulting flop was all the more predictable, observers say.</p><p>\"It's clear that the initial ambition of creating a sovereignty fund at EU level to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act has quickly vanished,\" said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Bruegel economic think tank in Brussels.</p><p>What remains in terms of clean tech funding in Europe is mainly state aid, which is covered by national budgets and can now happen more easily thanks to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1563\">Temporary Crisis Framework</url> adopted in March last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war.</p><p>However, this means national spending is not counterbalanced at the EU level by an instrument ensuring cohesion and scale among the 27 EU member states, Tagliapietra warned.</p><p>\"And that leaves Europe in a situation where member states with more fiscal space can spend more than others, which is problematic from an internal market perspective because it creates fragmentation,\" he says.</p><p>\"Looking at this proposal and the Net-Zero Industry Act - which is weak in terms of governance and focuses mostly on permitting - it's now clear that the EU's green industrial policy response, for now, has been pretty weak,\" Tagliapietra told EURACTIV.</p><p>Yet, the need for a green industrial policy is unlikely to go away. If anything, it is going to be felt more strongly as the EU moves closer to its objective of reducing emissions to net zero, which requires a complete transformation of the European industrial landscape.</p><p>In the absence of a sufficient EU budget to counterbalance national state aid for clean tech, the European Commission will also eventually be left with no choice but to reintroduce stricter rules on state aid, which will hinder the capacity of Germany and France to support their national clean tech champions.</p><p>Resistance against a genuine European industrial policy has always tended to come from big EU member states like Germany, who think they can move faster than others to secure jobs and growth for themselves.</p><p>But even if larger eurozone economies can score a few wins, they will always lack the scale to compete against China and the US in the global clean tech race.</p><p>\"There is no viable German, French, Italian or Spanish answer here; Europe can only be competitive globally with a common answer that creates an edge for European companies on global markets,\" Tagliapietra said.</p><p>\"Without a strong European dimension, EU countries will only end up cannibalising each other. And that certainly won't help Europe gain a competitive edge in the global race for clean tech,\" he argued.</p><p>As we get closer to the European elections in June 2024, the question will therefore inevitably return on the EU's agenda, Tagliapietra predicted.</p><p>\"It will be up to the new EU institutions after the European elections to do that. And if we don't do that, I think Europe will face problems in the future because the EU economy is carbon-intensive.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon</emphasis></p><h>Top stories</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/EPP-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/eus-nature-restoration-law-in-the-balance-ahead-of-decisive-july-vote/\">EU's Nature Restoration Law hangs in the balance ahead of decisive July vote</url></h><p>Europe's law to restore nature is in the balance, following a vote in the European Parliament's environment committee on Tuesday (27 June) that opened up the possibility for it to be definitely rejected by lawmakers during a whole Parliament vote in July.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/11560213-1-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/france-germany-italy-pledge-close-cooperation-on-critical-raw-materials/\">France, Germany, Italy pledge close cooperation on critical raw materials</url></h><p>France, Germany and Italy will cooperate more closely on critical raw materials as ministers pledged in Berlin on Monday (26 June) to invest in joint projects and exchange views on the EU's currently debated Critical Raw Materials Act.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Berlaymont-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/europe-risks-missing-2030-climate-goal-eu-auditors-warn/\">Europe risks missing 2030 climate goal, EU auditors warn</url></h><p>EU countries have so far filed only vague plans to meet their climate targets, with early indications pointing to a significant financing gap to meet the EU's objective of reducing emissions 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) said in a new report on Monday (26 June).</p><h>The Capitals - editor's pick</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PARIS.

Recent summer heatwaves in the north of the continent have caused massive social and economic losses and damages, breaking temperature records and severely disrupting agri-food systems in an already hungry region. Storms and cyclones early in the year caused devastation in Southern Africa and in Madagascar, resulting in the destruction of homes and the loss of lives. Eastern Africa is facing the worst food crisis in a generation, precipitated by extreme drought. In West Africa, cities are flooded, communities in the creeks are submerged, conflicts which have simmered for years are now intensifying due to climate-induced displacement. Climate change impedes on Africa\u2019s development, in a context already struggling due to an unjust global economic system.</p><p>Equally important, the Congo Basin, known as the \u201clungs of Africa\u201d, is absorbing more carbon than the Amazon. 1.5% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions are absorbed by the Republic of Congo alone. Six countries share its rainforest, providing food security and essential livelihoods to indigenous and local populations and sustaining endangered species. Africa\u2019s future, as well as the world\u2019s, depends on preserving the Congo Basin forests. The Congo Basin forests must be preserved for the sake of the future of not only Africa, but the world in general. To combat climate change and biodiversity loss, we must preserve this rich and lush ecosystem, which is increasingly being threatened by deforestation, environmental degradation, and worsening climate change impacts.\u00a0</p><p>In these days, world leaders are making their way to Africa to attend the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 otherwise known as COP27. All people of God, wherever they are in the world, must surely agree that this conference must deliver for Africa.\u00a0 There is no doubt that the EU and more generally the Global North has a great responsibility in this regard as one of the major contributors to the climate crisis and must contribute their fair share to address it. Progressive EU Member States should use this moment to step up their climate action and support for vulnerable countries by pushing for the highest ambition level for the EU by 2030.\u00a0 They should be leading the way in emissions reductions, providing funding for climate adaptation, loss and damage, and supporting countries in the Global South to achieve just levels of development within planetary boundaries. We know that the most promising solutions will reflect key principles of Catholic Social Teaching, such as the common good, social justice between generations, care for our common home and the preferential option for the poor. The solutions to this crisis must not continue the business-as-usual approach that is responsible for creating the problem in the first place and will only enrich wealthy nations and individuals at the expense of the world\u2019s poor.</p><p>And yet, in the face of these certainties, it can still be challenging to understand the precise routes to change. In the latest Encyclical, Fratelli Tutti, Pope Francis proposed dialogue and encounter as a means of building a more just world (n\u00b0199,203). This was the inspiration for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cidse.org/2022/06/30/african-climate-dialogues-towards-cop27/\">African Climate Dialogues</url> \u2013 a series of conversations hosted by Catholic Church actors and civil society in Africa to discuss, learn from each other and identify key policy priorities ahead of COP27 in Egypt. These dialogues included community and civil society representatives with lived experiences of climate change, researchers and professional advocates with policy expertise, officials from all levels of government, and leaders in the Catholic Church who could frame the pressing ethical questions raised by climate change in terms of the action of God and the demands of justice.</p><p>On 17th October, I was proud to launch a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cidse.org/2022/10/17/african-climate-dialogues-communique/\">communiqu\u00e9</url> from the African Climate Dialogues process, alongside leaders from youth movements, NGOs and Governments representing Africa at COP27. This document serves as a road-map for action at COP27 on the key topics of appropriate solutions, climate finance, migration and displacement, food systems and loss and damage. It sets out demands for the conference, informed by practitioners, communities and experts in light of theological reflection on the sacred scriptures. I will travel to Sharm El Sheikh to bring these cries for action to the negotiating table, and to show that the Church in Africa is standing up for communities already suffering from climate change in my continent.</p><p>Climate change is a moral outrage.

Growing up in Canada we even had school events to teach us about the environment and why recycling glass and aluminum were important. My parents, having immigrated from Egypt, thought it was cute, but rarely followed suite. The environment was not a concern of theirs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The obligation to recycle grew during the 90s. At the time, my father felt obliged to learn about it and do his part. My mother, on the other hand, let me take care of it, but she wasn't convinced about it and there were no repercussions for her unwillingness to see why it could help.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Greenwashing is not new</p><p>Sadly, much of our efforts in our squeaky-clean persona of Canada were for nought. A lot of the waste was not recycled in Canada, but rather shipped off to China or Malaysia. Even today, much of the recycling of waste from Canada is done in India.</p><p>In 1995, as I was coming of age in this environmental quagmire, the first COP was held and this is where the Kyoto Protocol was established. This past week, I covered COP27 for our publication. 27 means the 27th year of trying to figure out climate change.</p><p>Ahead of COP27, there was talk of greenwashing, as is the case at every COP; and yes, this year is as abundant as any other. Eco-friendly goody bags are given out for free, filled with a glass water bottle, and recycled paper pad and pencils. Food can be purchased (at exorbitant prices) all wrapped in paper, apart from the plastic juice bottles.</p><p>In every event room, the air conditioners are cranked up to the max because the heat beneath the Sinai sun is hot and foreigners may not like to feel warm. The local architecture that could have been used to keep heat at bay is not seen as modern or Western.</p><p>However, the moment you step into the pseudo-real world of Sharm, a resort town, you step back into the true reality: overly packaged goods, people throwing stuff on the street, and development in all directions clearly impacting the natural environment, which huge billboards announce is important.</p><p>The awareness has not trickled down.</p><p>This reality is not specific to Egypt (apart from human rights). It happens at every COP and every country outside of COP: A beautiful veneer of 'we can do this!' coupled with 'eco-friendly' items or venues and the belief that maybe this year we'll figure it out.</p><p>We're not that smart</p><p>Humanity has proven itself to be the stupidest of all species. I say this as a member of this collective group. Wars, inequalities, racism, genderism, selfishness, etc....can be traced back to every culture and empire, regardless of geography. We refuse to learn. We refuse to evolve.</p><p>The only common thread in our thousands of years of existence is the drive for profit - be it in exchange for food, jewels, territory or money.</p><p>People keep saying the youth can make a difference. I'd like to believe it too, but the reality is a whole other story, and frankly it's a lazy way of putting-off hard decisions. The youth can drive awareness. They can make noise, but they can't effect change high up.</p><p>Here at COP27, there was a day to celebrate their voice - one group was visible on site. I walked by, as did others. Some took photos, some stopped to listen to their cheer: 'What do [we] want? Climate Justice. When do we want it? Now!' Lots of applause, and then back to business.</p><p>Journalists cover this important business - from the signing of this 'near-ban on coal deal', the celebration of 'country X to offer more funding', to how leaders 'agree to tackle climate change by 2030'. That business is shrouded in power trips. When someone high up from any one of these events grants the lowly journalist a moment to ask a question, it's often very rushed, the I-don't-have-time-for-you-I'm-very-important-and-needed, because at the end of the day, the person also doesn't know how this will help solve the problem.</p><p>So long as humanity is driven by blind greed, our planet will continue on the same trajectory. We can produce as many eco-friendly gadgets as we want, strut around like peacocks at these grand COP events, sign deals, take photos as proof of our good intentions, and then perhaps granting a journalist a comment to say: 'I'm so excited about this, this is a real game-changer'. However, nothing will change until we start to block out profit and focus on change.</p><p>Government action</p><p>I have close family friends who run a plastic business in an undisclosed African country. We jokingly argue about how companies like theirs are the problem. They sell plastic pellets (even if they are less plastic and more carbon carbonate) to other factories to melt down and make into bags, containers etc.</p><p>Whenever I mention that they are part of the problem of our climate crisis, I am told quite simply that it's a question of profit and that turning to alternatives, such as bio-plastics, is not profitable. On top of this is that there's no impetus to alter the status quo. If 'governments banned plastic' then companies, such as the plastic business, would be faced to make changes. This is the bottom line of our latest discussion.</p><p>Ahead of COP27, Coca Cola, aka the 'King of Plastic Pollution' - one of the official sponsors (who provided endless amounts of glass-bottled coke during the event, but has since secretly pulled out of its sponsorship) - increased the use of its newly manufactured plastic by 3.5% since 2019, reported the Financial Times.</p><p>They may sign deals to offset carbon through the carbon credit market, or provide glass bottles, but so long as plastic is still a viable alternative, and their factories continue to function as they do - producing as much CO2 as two large generating plants, not to mention the other toxic pollutants often dumped at nearby communities (if unregulated) - we will continue to have a classic case of profit over change.</p><p>At no point, between my early environmental years and the present, has a government taken the high position of banning such practices. Bangladesh and Rwanda have both banned plastic bags, but there's always someone smuggling bags into each respective country.</p><p>Other countries and regions, including the EU, have banned single-use plastics. Is it enforced? When I grab take-out from nearby restaurants in my rather bobo-left-leaning neighbourhood in Paris, the answer is no. Much of it is still served in plastic because the companies producing such items have no reason to stop.</p><p>What is real power in action</p><p>Small declarations, such as what will come out of COP27, are band-aid solutions. The trick to ripping off a band-aid with little pain is to do it fast. The one way to really make huge strides in saving this planet, which is run by humans who are still functioning the same way they did thousands of years ago, is to enforce change.</p><p>Leaders from the top - however they are elected - wield power. Rather than walk around these events surrounded by bodyguards to ensure their power is intact, why not use that power to bring about concrete change? Not an idea, or another possible deal to sign, but a real change that may hamper profits in the short-term, but benefit everyone in the long-term.</p><p>Doing so would force all citizens to pay attention and to readjust. Without access to plastic bags, or polluting factories, people would adjust, as they always have. Even my mother would then recycle.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": ["The youth can drive awareness. They can make noise, but they can't effect change high up.

Trees are, science tells us, social beings and do some of the same things we humans do, at least when we're acting our best. They trade tips about health, news about weather. They nourish, and protect, and support each other. They support fellow beings too: birds, insects, us. They live sane lives. They generate excellent karma.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike us. In a goes-around-comes-around universe, the karma we're producing - through competitive greed, unthinking waste and targeted malice - is killing the world around us. We're at war with the planet and everything on it, trees included.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The artist and architect Maya Lin began her career with a response to a war. Her 1982 Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, a blade of black granite slashed into American soil, commemorates a \"foreign\" war that became an internal one and divided the nation. Her new installation, \"Ghost Forest,\" on view in Madison Square Park in Manhattan through Nov. 14, is commemorative too. It's a sky-reaching memorial to a war in progress directed against everything we call Nature.       </p><p>Is \"directed against\" too active a phrase? Some people simply don't know that human-sourced climate change exists. Others underestimate its gravity. Still others - a recent United States president - dismisses it as a fiction. In not dissimilar ways, we ignored or downplayed the Vietnam War in its early phases, until protests got really noisy, pictures of the My Lai massacre leaked out, and guys we'd partied with in high school came home in body bags.       </p><p>Now, as then, cluelessness and denial are hard to sustain. Temperatures are climbing, shores are flooding, fields are shriveling up. Entire species - four-footed, winged, finned and rooted - are suddenly M.I.A., and the casualty list is growing. Yet, in the United States, public protest against climate breakdown is still sporadic and tepid, which is why every resistant gesture feels crucial, as \"Ghost Forest\" does.       </p><p>Commissioned by the Madison Square Park Conservancy, \"Ghost Forest\" is basically a reconstituted patch of damaged nature. From the coastal Pine Barrens of New Jersey, Lin brought to Manhattan 49 full-grown Atlantic white cedars, each around 40 feet tall, and planted them together at the center of a bosky Madison Square Park. In the context of the park's arboreal luxe they make an odd sight, because they're leafless, and clearly dead or dying.       </p><p>They'd been harvested from a habitat infiltrated by salt water, a result of climate change. Salt water is poison for trees; it rots them from within. Sick beyond saving, the cedars now in the park had been cleared from their original home to make room for a regeneration effort.       </p><p>Although Lin was trained as an architect - she recently redesigned the Neilson Library at Smith College in Northampton, Mass. - her most memorable public work has been sculpture, and has drawn on the natural world as both a medium and a theme. In 2009, at the Storm King Art Center, 60 miles north of Manhattan, she created, from packed earth and grass, an 11-acre low-rise landscape of gently swelling hills, the forms inspired by ocean waves and the surrounding Hudson Valley mountains.       </p><p>\"My affinity has always been toward sculpting the earth,\" she wrote in her autobiographical book, \"Boundaries,\" published in 2000, \"This impulse has shaped my entire body of work.\"       </p><p>Since that book appeared, the focus on planetary survival has sharpened dramatically. Climate justice, intersecting with other social justice initiatives, is - in Europe, for sure - among the 21st century's frontline activist movements.       </p><p>If \"Ghost Forest\" isn't, technically, activist art - like \"Wave Field\" it's closer to the \"environmental art\" of an earlier time - its stark image of terrestrial loss is motored by the same urgency as climate justice resistance.       </p><p>Still, it takes a few minutes, once you're in the park, for the image to fully register. From a distance, the transplanted cedars blend into the larger arboreal fabric. Then tonal contrasts begin to sort out: The trunks of the park's living trees are loamy browns and blacks; those of the cedars, a dry gray-going-white. (This difference was immediately striking when the installation opened in May, before the park had fully leafed, and probably will be again as summer turns to fall.)       </p><p>Another contrast: Glance upward while standing under the park's resident trees and you see an overhang of green, dense enough to keep off rain; look up while standing under the cedars and you see open sky. Whatever foliage they once had is long gone, and their branches seem to have been shaved away. Only a few remain, like thin sticking-out arms.       </p><p>There's no question that Lin intended \"Ghost Forest\" as an emblem of profound injury. But another image comes through too: an image of sociability, of a community of personalities, a congregation of spirits.       </p><p>To produce it, she has carefully choreographed the placement of the cedars. A few line up in rows like cathedral columns. But most are in asymmetrical groupings, the equivalent of conversational clusters, of a kind you might find at parties and neighborly gatherings, and of a kind that trees in the wild actually form for purposes of communicating through their surfaces and the sharing of nutrients through their roots.       </p><p>In addition, the \"Ghost Forest\" project comes with what Lin refers to as \"advocacy components.\" She has arranged a fall planting of a thousand trees throughout the five boroughs to offset the carbon used in moving the cedars to Manhattan.

Hemke. A coproduction between the festival and Schauspiel Frankfurt, \"Solastalgia\" is an artful and elegant lamentation about the state of our planet. K\u00f6ck, a young Austrian theater maker, finds an arrestingly poetic register for this meditation on the grief and panic that are common responses to seeing nature perish. Essentially a 70-minute-long monologue that K\u00f6ck, who also directs the energetic and music-filled production, distributes among three actresses, it is by turns humorous, absurd, surreal and horrifying.       </p><p>On a simple, semicircular set, the actresses Miriam Schiweck, Katharina Linder and Mateja Meded, in costumes that seem stitched together from garbage, declaim K\u00f6ck's fragmented text, which contains ruminations on Germany's increasingly ravaged forests and a narrative about a former builder for whom solastalgia becomes not only an existential but also a physical malady. K\u00f6ck's text is lyrical and poetic, with rhythms and cadences of overlapping dialogue creating musical effects.       </p><p>For artists who set out to make works about burning issues like climate change, there is always a danger of sliding into righteousness, or sermonizing. Yet there's a fundamental openness to K\u00f6ck's play that prevents it from becoming propagandistic. How ought we mourn the destruction of our habitat? How best do we live with the knowledge that the forests, beaches and oceans we love are vanishing? \"Solastalgia\" offers few answers, but its barrage of powerful images and incantatory language creates room for poetic and philosophical reflection.       </p><p>The ecological outrage and anxiety at the core of \"Solastalgia\" were also central to \"Welcome to Paradise Lost,\" a musical theater work that might best be described as an immersive environmental agitprop Gesamtkunstwerk. During the performance, the audience follows a cast of actors, singers and musicians through various indoor and outdoor locations in a former electrical power plant on the edge of Weimar's historic center. Unfortunately, much of \"Welcome to Paradise Lost,\" adapted from a recent play by Falk Richter, a leading German dramatist, has a hectoring tone that makes it less compelling than the inventive production, directed by Andrea Moses.       </p><p>Although the direct source material for \"Welcome to Paradise Lost\" is the Persian verse epic \"The Conference of the Birds,\" in which winged creatures gather to seek an enlightened sovereign, Richter's text also nods to Aristophanes and Alfred Hitchcock. In Farid ud-Din Attar's 12th-century poem, the birds travel through a succession of allegorically named valleys where they are confronted with human vices and stupidities. In Richter's version, the Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg (sung by the young Swedish soprano Ylva Stenberg) guides a chorus of 14 youngsters wearing rubber bird masks on the path of resistance and uprising.       </p><p>As Greta leads her panicked flock, alarmed over the loss of their habitat, their methods evolve. Impassioned yet peaceful gatherings reminiscent of Fridays for Future give way to the disruptive tactics associated with Extinction Rebellion in an exciting smoke- and flare-filled outdoor scene where the birds plot terroristic revenge on humankind. But for all the undeniable energy of the production and the performances, \"Welcome to Paradise Lost\" isn't exactly the climate change opera we've been waiting for.       </p><p>The music by the local composer J\u00f6rn Arnecke has moments of arresting lyricism yet is just as often pedestrian. Most crucially, perhaps, the libretto itself, containing numerous outside texts, including Thunberg's \"How dare you\" speech to the United Nations, neither hangs together nor gives any sense of a narrative or a poetic progression. It is loopier and more freewheeling than \"Solastalgia\" but also has the subtlety of a cudgel, thanks to sloganizing and finger wagging.       </p><p>Shifting registers, the Kunstfest turned from environmental alarm to the scourge of right-wing radicalism in Germany.       </p><p>\"Werwolfkommandos,\" a sobering piece of docudrama directed by Marie Schwesinger, is an almost clinical probe into two recent trials that roiled the nation: the first, of a neo-Nazi who in 2019 assassinated Walter L\u00fcbcke, a regional official in the city of Kassel; the second, of the German military officer who had posed as a Syrian refugee and was planning a string of assassinations at the time of his arrest in 2017.       </p><p>Rage-filled yet coolly dispassionate, \"Werwolfkommandos\" consists largely of verbal reconstructions of the trials. Dressed monochromatically, four steely actors bring sang-froid to the courtroom proceedings. The way the actors keep sifting through the evidence, the arguments and the timelines, and the minutiae of the proceedings becomes infuriating and exasperating, which is, of course, precisely the point. At the end of the production, the house lights go dark, and the actors, their faces uncannily illumined by the glow of their cellphones, recite headlines about right-wing extremism. The night of the premiere, the most recent news item was just three days old.       </p><p>Right-wing terror has a particular significance in Weimar. You have only to venture 20 minutes outside of the picturesque old city, with its monuments to Goethe and Schiller, to arrive at the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald. To travel the six miles between them is to be confronted with the proximity of culture and barbarism that is inscribed in German history.       </p><p>An installation by the American artist Aura Rosenberg, which is part of the Kunstfest's program, offers a poetic reflection on Walter Benjamin's essay \"On the Concept of History,\" which famously interprets a print by the Bauhaus artist Paul Klee, \"Angelus Novus,\" as the emblem of history, unable to turn away from the catastrophes of the past as it is blown into the future.       </p><p>At the center of Rosenberg's installation, on view at the Bauhaus Museum Weimar until Oct. 31, is a multilayered video work, \"Angel of Paradise,\" that literalizes Benjamin's vision of history as \"one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage\" in a trippy computer-animated collage. And yet, at the center of the rubble of civilization heaped together onscreen, we find visual echoes of Benjamin's \"spark of hope in the past\" that drives us to imagine a brighter tomorrow, despite the calamities of history.       </p><p>A similar hope courses through the works of artists invited by the Kunstfest Weimar to share their theatrical responses to our deeply imperfect present.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solastalgia.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Directed by Thomas K\u00f6ck.</emphasis> Sept. 23 through Oct. 21 at Schauspiel Frankfurt.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Welcome to Paradise Lost.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Directed by Andrea Moses.</emphasis> Deutsches Nationaltheater Weimar.

Among the other projects being undertaken by this year's fellows: an effort to promote healing trends in the movement to end mass incarceration; work to explore and develop connections between the environmental and climate justice movements and movements to combat punitive policing and prison policies; and a bid to bring an abolitionist queer feminist lens to antideportation work in the Southeast Asian community. Other fellows will work to help those in the informal economy fight attempts to criminalize their work, research the landscape of the sex trade, call out abusive surveillance practices targeting immigrants, combat state violence in Puerto Rico, and use beekeeping as a tool to help provide financial opportunity to the formerly incarcerated. It's exciting to see the incredible range of ideas and tools these fellows bring to the cause of advancing justice,\" said Leonard Noisette, who oversees the fellowship program as leader of the Justice team in Open Society-U.

But when The Associated Press released a picture of the five from the event, Ms. Nakate had been cropped out.       </p><p>The omission shocked and saddened Ms. Nakate, who in a tearful 10-minute video posted on Twitter denounced the \"racism\" in the global environmental movement and the erasure of Black and African voices from conversations around climate activism, even as their communities and countries are disproportionately affected by the crisis.       </p><p>\"I felt like I had wasted time going to Davos,\" she said in a recent interview in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. \"I felt that I shouldn't have been at the news conference.\"       </p><p>Yet her presence at the event and the effect that the episode had on her elicited a response that reverberated across the world.

With no job lined up, Ms. Nakate volunteered with the Rotary Club organization, where she was researching the biggest challenges facing local areas and how she could help. That was when she realized that climate change was not some distant threat, but a problem that at that very moment was eating away at communities and destroying livelihoods.       </p><p>She also found out about Fridays for Future, the movement that Ms. Thunberg started to pressure policymakers to listen to scientists and act.       </p><p>Though eager to take action herself, Ms. Nakate said she was initially afraid of taking to Kampala's streets to protest alone.

In December 2019, she was one of a few young activists who were invited to speak at the United Nations climate talks in Spain.       </p><p>She also turned her attention to the rest of Africa, and created the Rise Up Movement to raise awareness about climate change and co-founded One Million Activist Stories to document the experiences of young activists worldwide.       </p><p>In Uganda, her Green Schools project is installing solar panels and eco-friendly stoves in schools across the country - part of her efforts, she said, to educate young people in rural and urban areas about the realities of climate change.       </p><p>\"They are tomorrow's leaders,\" Ms. Nakate said. \"They are tomorrow's campaigners.

He wants guarantees that the money will end up in the right hands.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HOUSTON - He's known as the father of environmental justice, but more than half a century ago he was just Bob Bullard from Elba, a flyspeck town deep in Alabama that didn't pave roads, install sewers or put up streetlights in areas where Black families like his lived. His grandmother had a sixth grade education. His father was an electrician and plumber who for years couldn't get licensed because of his race.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, more than four decades after Robert Bullard took an unplanned career turn into environmentalism and civil rights, the movement he helped found is clocking one of its biggest wins yet. Some $60 billion of the $370 billion in climate spending passed by Congress last month has been earmarked for environmental justice, which calls for equal environmental protections for all, the cause to which Dr. Bullard has devoted his life.       </p><p>Some environmentalists have slammed the new legislation for allowing more oil and gas drilling, which generally hits disadvantaged communities the hardest. For Dr. Bullard, the new law is reason for celebration, but also caution. Too often, he said, federal money and relief funds are doled out inequitably by state and local governments, and away from people of color and poor communities, who are the most afflicted by pollution and most vulnerable to climate change. This might be a major moment for environmental justice, he said, but never before has so much been at stake.       </p><p>\"We need government watchdogs to ensure the money follows need,\" Dr. Bullard said in a recent interview. \"Climate change will make the inequities and disparities worse, and widen that gap. That's why this time, we have to get this right.\"       </p><p>Dr. Bullard, 75, is one of the foremost experts of environmental justice in the world. His seminal 1990 book \"Dumping in Dixie,\" about toxic facilities in communities of color, has been cited in scholarly articles more than 5,600 times. He doesn't remember when exactly he began being called the \"Father of Environmental Justice,\" and though the sobriquet is prominently displayed on his website, he didn't come up with it himself (there are other vaunted elders in the field), and affects a degree of humility when asked about it.       </p><p>\"It's better to be called the 'father of' than 'son of,'\" Dr. Bullard said during an interview at Texas Southern University this past spring. \"It's really a compliment, but again, I've been called worse.\"       </p><p>In recent years especially, as environmental justice has come to the fore, Dr. Bullard's visibility has spiked. Requests for talks and interviews pour in daily, in no small part because of his style: He can deliver a blizzard of alarming facts while remaining upbeat, and serve up unvarnished honesty with a smile. Of the roughly two dozen awards and prestigious appointments Dr. Bullard has collected over his career, nearly half have come in the last four years. In 2021, he became a White House adviser, and, with $1.25 million from the Houston Endowment and later $4 million from the Bezos Earth Fund, Texas Southern University opened the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice.       </p><p>\"I don't know any person on the planet who has done more to advocate and raise awareness on this issue,\" said Paul Mohai, a professor at the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan, who has known Dr. Bullard for more than 30 years. \"It's impossible to not have a boost of adrenaline when he speaks.\"       </p><p>Dr. Bullard was born in 1946 to a family that defied the odds. In 1875, 10 years after the official abolishment of slavery, his great-grandparents acquired several hundred acres of timberland in Elba. \"We don't know how they got it,\" Dr. Bullard said. \"We don't ask.\"       </p><p>The land proved a game changer. As property holders, his parents and grandmother could vote under Jim Crow laws. On Election Days, they dressed in their Sunday best and headed to the ballot box, even though it meant paying poll taxes and passing literacy tests. Timber harvested from the land also allowed the family to send Bob and his four siblings to college, a rarity for Black people at the time.       </p><p>After graduating from Alabama A&amp;M University, young Bob Bullard had another stroke of luck. It was the height of the Vietnam War, and he was drafted to the Marines, yet somehow didn't get deployed, escaping the harrowing fate that befell others in his platoon. Funded by the G.I. Bill, he went on to get a master's degree and doctorate in sociology, and emerged determined to model his career on that of his hero, the writer and civil rights champion W.E.B. DuBois.       </p><p>\"He didn't do dead white man sociology, he did what I call kick-ass sociology,\" Dr. Bullard said. \"You can be a scholar and an activist and you can do something to make change.\"       </p><p>The environment wasn't on Dr. Bullard's radar until 1979, when he was teaching sociology at Texas Southern University and his wife, Linda McKeever Bullard, a lawyer, asked for his help. She was filing a class-action lawsuit to stop a landfill from going into a middle class Black community in Houston, and tapped her husband to find out where the city's other landfills were. He enlisted his students, and after painstaking research they discovered that although Black people made up just a quarter of Houston's population, all five of the city's garbage dumps, six of its eight incinerators, and three out of its four privately-owned landfills were in Black neighborhoods.       </p><p>The case spent eight years in court, ending in 1987 with a decision allowing the landfill to proceed. Dr. Bullard was stunned. \"The data and research were solid,\" Dr. Bullard said. \"But it was not enough to overcome the legacy of racism in the county system.\"       </p><p>After the landfill was built in the tree-lined community of Black-owned homes, Dr. Bullard said more industrial sites followed, driving down property values. \"That's theft of wealth,\" he said. Outraged, he was determined to uncover more examples of how communities of color were disproportionately beset with poisoned water, soil and air.       </p><p>In the 1980s, environmentalism and civil rights were by and large on two different tracks, and Dr. Bullard struggled to get backing from either camp. The major environmental groups told him they didn't work on what they characterized as a social issue - \"my response was, 'Is breathing social?'\" Dr. Bullard said. Meanwhile, civil rights organizations often said their focus was on discrimination in housing, voting, employment and education. The \"Dumping in Dixie\" manuscript was rejected a dozen times for similar reasons; Dr. Bullard was told the words \"environment\" and \"racism\" didn't belong together because the environment couldn't be racist. The publisher who finally bought it made it into a textbook, which initially angered Dr. Bullard until he realized it was getting adopted by universities nationwide, seeding his findings in young minds.       </p><p>\"'Dumping in Dixie' is the environmental justice bible,\" said Na'Taki Osborne Jelks, an environmental health scientist who studied under Dr. Bullard as an undergraduate, and now teaches at Spelman College. \"He set up a road map for others to follow who wanted to combine scholarship along with activism and advocacy.\"       </p><p>Today, after decades of organizing and mobilizing, environmental justice is a foremost concern to climate activists, a rise that Peggy Shepard, executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, in Harlem, attributed in large part to the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd's murder. Ms. Shepard added that she'd never seen so much media interest or funding offers. \"We've been fighting the David and Goliath fight with a slingshot,\" she said.       </p><p>And environmental organizations that ignored race 15 years ago were now \"stumbling over each other\" to enlist people of color, Dr. Bullard said. The biggest green groups remain overwhelmingly white, and have faced their own racial reckonings. In 2020, a Black staff member resigned from the Union of Concerned Scientists, publicly slamming what she described as its ingrained tokenism; a few weeks later the Sierra Club said it had to confront the white supremacism of its founder, John Muir.       </p><p>Beverly Wright, founder and executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orleans, and a longtime collaborator with Dr. Bullard, said the exclusion of people of color came at a cost. Surveys taken in 2020 by Yale University and George Mason University showed that 80 percent of Latinos and 75 percent of Black people were worried about climate change, compared with 59 percent of whites.       </p><p>\"They realized they can't do this by themselves, and need us in the room to get anything done, or passed,\" said Dr. Wright, referring to the major environmental groups. \"All things work better for all of us when we are in the room.\"       </p><p>Still, theirs remains an uphill battle. In August, Democrats made concessions allowing for more fossil fuel expansion in order to secure support for the climate bill from Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who holds a crucial swing vote in an evenly divided Senate. This infuriated some environmental justice advocates who said marginalized communities, especially those near Gulf Coast petrochemical plants, were being made sacrificial lambs.       </p><p>There are also questions about whether the Democrats are overcounting the $60 billion designated for environmental justice in the new climate law. Sylvia Chi, a strategist with the Just Solutions Collective, calculated the amount to be closer to $40 billion; by her analysis the White House appeared to be including the value of entire programs rather than smaller amounts targeted to disadvantaged communities, or possibly programs that don't target those communities at all.       </p><p>Dr. Bullard, for his part, touted the bill as historic, and applauded the inclusion of community block grants and funding for pollution monitoring near industrial facilities.       </p><p>But he and his colleagues are concerned about oversight and the money getting to disadvantaged communities as intended, and fear that enforceable targets aren't laid out explicitly. \"The implementation is the fight,\" said Dr. Wright.       </p><p>Dr. Bullard pointed to an investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development earlier this year that found a Texas state agency discriminated against people of color when it distributed relief funds after Hurricane Harvey. Research also shows that FEMA, the government agency responsible for helping Americans recover from disasters, has often helped white disaster victims more than people of color, even when the amount of damage is the same. Southern states especially had a long history of unequal treatment of communities and lax enforcement of civil rights laws, Dr. Bullard noted. \"The devil is in the details,\" he said.       </p><p>A spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said the administration was \"committed to allocating the funding in line with the statute.\"       </p><p>Jalonne White-Newsome, the senior director for Environmental Justice at the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, said a new environmental scorecard was being developed to hold federal agencies to account. Funds are also to be allotted using a new framework the Biden administration announced earlier this year. Still, the formula raised some hackles because it omits race.       </p><p>Since the law was enacted, Dr. Bullard has never been more in demand, and Dr. Wright, who is also in her 70s, said they recently shared a laugh over how busy they were.       </p><p>\"I said, 'Bob, it's coming in so fast we can't get to it,' and he said 'Isn't that amazing?'\" Dr. Wright recalled. \"It would've been better at 40, but why are you going to slow down when you finally have resources?\" she continued. \"He's never slowed down. Why would he now?\" </p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["Bullard's visibility has spiked.
