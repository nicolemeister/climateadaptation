Palm-oil-producing countries have made significant efforts to reduce indirect land use change from its cultivation. But will it be enough to satisfy the new law?</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Last week, the European Commission published a legal act ahead of the start of the world's first anti-deforestation law, which will take effect in the EU at the end of this year. The act benchmarks countries based on the risk of deforestation caused by their exports.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>Four countries were given the designation as being at \"high risk\" of fuelling deforestation: North Korea, Russia, Belarus and Myanmar.<br/><br/><br/>Major forest nations such as Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia were assigned the category of \"standard risk\". Compliance checks will be required for 9% of exports from high-risk countries, while 3% will be required for those from standard-risk.<br/><br/><br/>The categorisation has caused controversy, with some accusing the Commission of making the designations for political reasons rather than scientific ones.<br/><br/><br/>Others have said the Commission is trying to lessen the impact of the rules after countries and companies complained that the bureaucratic burden would be too much, something which already caused the delay of the start of the legislation from the original date of December 2024.<br/><br/><br/>But the standard risk countries say that the designation reflects the significant progress they have made in tackling deforestation over the past decade.<br/><br/><br/>This has been especially true for palm-oil-producing countries, which were the subject of intense scrutiny ten years ago amid concern that EU biofuel targets for transport were driving an increase in palm oil production, which was in turn driving deforestation. Since then, both Indonesia and Malaysia have made efforts to get a handle on the situation.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Abrupt EU policy shift</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The EU's biofuel targets, first adopted in 2003, were intended to reduce the use of fossil fuels in transport, to combat climate change. So, the possibility that the policy could be increasing climate change by driving Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) when forests are cleared to grow the crops became alarming to policymakers starting in 2010.<br/><br/><br/>In 2014, the amount of first-generation biofuels that can be used to meet the renewable fuel targets was capped, and palm oil can no longer be used to meet the target.<br/><br/><br/>Forests act as a natural carbonk sink to suck emissions out of the atmosphere, and forest fires are the second-largest contributor to global warming, accounting for 19% of global carbon emissions between 1959 and 2019, according to a study by Oxford University.<br/><br/><br/>Governments, therefore, also have an interest in stopping deforestation, and significant efforts have been made in that direction.<br/><br/><br/>Concerted conservation efforts, commitments towards climate neutrality under the Paris Agreement, and targeted wildlife protection projects have already begun to influence the trajectory of forest preservation and sustainable palm oil production.<br/><br/><br/>Both Indonesia and Malaysia have established a network of protected areas, including national parks and conservation corridors, designed to safeguard remaining primary forests and endangered species habitats. Legislative reforms have been introduced in both countries to improve land-use planning, enforce anti-encroachment measures, and monitor illegal logging activities.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Significant progress</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The results of these changes have already been seen.<br/><br/><br/>In 2018-2020, deforestation for palm oil was 45,285 hectares per year, 18% of its peak in 2008-2012, according to research by the deforestation NGO Trase. And that drop came during a period of continued expansion of palm oil production. Some of the drop can be attributed to a drop in the market value of crude palm oil following the legislative changes ten years ago. But there has been a recent spike in palm oil prices since then, which has not been accompanied by a boom in palm-driven deforestation, according to Trase.<br/><br/><br/>\"Palm oil presents a positive example of decoupling commodity production from deforestation,\" says Anita Neville, Chief Sustainability and Communications Officer at the Singapore-based palm oil company Golden Agri-Resources. \"This hasn't been achieved through policy and pledges alone, but by sustained, collaborative efforts between government as well as the public and private sectors.\"<br/><br/><br/>She points to Initiatives such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which her company is a member of, as an example of ways that industry commitments on implementing No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) can be measured and verified. \"What that data demonstrates is that a long-term commitment of time and investment to engage and upskill farmers can improve practices and is effective in tackling deforestation.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net-zero emissions</emphasis><br/><br/>The commitments by Indonesia and Malaysia to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement have also played a pivotal role in reorienting policies and industry practices.<br/><br/><br/>These commitments have prompted governments to integrate climate objectives with forest conservation, fostering initiatives aimed at restoring degraded lands and promoting agroforestry practices. As a result, some palm oil producers have begun to shift towards more sustainable land use, such as intensification on existing plantations and dedicating land to conservation, thereby reducing pressure to clear new forests.<br/><br/><br/>The international financial sector and consumers' increasing demand for sustainable products have also incentivised companies to invest in environmentally responsible practices.<br/><br/><br/>Aside from saving forests, these efforts have also focused on protecting wildlife and biodiversity.<br/><br/><br/>Several projects have targeted iconic species, including orangutans, Sumatran rhinos, and elephants. For instance, wildlife corridors have been established in Indonesia to facilitate movement and genetic exchange among populations, reducing fragmentation caused by plantations.<br/><br/><br/>Community-based conservation projects have been established, engaging local communities in safeguarding habitats and promoting alternative livelihoods.<br/><br/><br/>Other initiatives include rescue and rehabilitation centres for critically endangered species, research on habitat connectivity, and anti-poaching efforts supported by international collaboration. These efforts aim to address the root causes of wildlife decline caused by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and illegal poaching.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Compliant with EU law?</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Despite these advances, significant hurdles remain.<br/><br/><br/>Deforestation continues in certain regions due to weak enforcement, land tenure ambiguities, and economic incentives favouring land conversion. 2.4 million hectares of intact forest remain\u00a0within Indonesia's oil palm concessions, according to Trase, which presents a risk for backtracking on progress made so far.<br/><br/><br/>\"This large area of forest designated for palm oil production underscores both an opportunity for conservation, as well as the potential risk that further oil palm expansion may pose to Indonesia's rainforest,\" Trase has concluded in an analysis. \"A fundamental challenge over the coming decade will be to meet continued growth in demand for products derived from palm oil, while ensuring that deforestation continues to decline.\"<br/><br/><br/>To address this, comprehensive supply chain transparency, strengthened enforcement of zero-deforestation commitments, and the adoption of satellite monitoring and AI-based land-use tracking are essential. Additionally, supporting smallholder farmers in adopting sustainable practices and ensuring equitable land rights can reduce incentives to clear forests.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Enough progress?</emphasis><br/><br/>The big question is whether the progress made in Indonesia and Malaysia on palm oil will be enough to satisfy the new EU deforestation law requirements.<br/><br/><br/>Campaigners say they still believe the law is the best tool to stop global deforestation, even if there are concerns about the low number of countries designated as high risk. \"The benchmarking system unfortunately falls short of what the science requires... but in practice, this shouldn't undermine the power of this law to save forests,\" said Giulia Bondi, senior EU campaigner at Global Witness, following the publication of the implementing act last week.<br/><br/><br/>\"Even when trading in products produced in a 'low' or 'standard-risk' country, companies will still have to prove their supply chains are free from deforestation and human rights abuses,\" she added.<br/><br/><br/>But many companies, and governments both within and outside the EU, say the law risks being too prescriptive and could hinder deforestation efforts - concerns which have already resulted in the law's delay.<br/><br/><br/>\"The EU's continued uncertainty about EUDR implementation diverts attention from valid concerns that the measure is all stick and no carrot,\" says Neville. \"Without support and incentives to transition to more sustainable practices, the risk is that smallholder farmers - farming families that don't have the means or capacity to comply yet - will be shut out of global markets.\"<br/><br/><br/>Neville says that regardless of what happens with the EU deforestation law, the industry's progress will continue, noting that, \"Growers, customers and industry bodies will continue our collaboration to tackle the root causes of this problem, hoping to promote resilient, sustainable incomes for farmers that produce responsibly.\"<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["Palm oil presents a positive example of decoupling commodity production from deforestation,\" says Anita Neville, Chief Sustainability and Communications Officer at the Singapore-based palm oil company Golden Agri-Resources. \"This hasn't been achieved through policy and pledges alone, but by sustained, collaborative efforts between government as well as the public and private sectors.

The Israel-based biotech focuses on agriculture and plant genomics. The company's Casterra business supplies castor seeds for uses such as biofuels and biopolymers.</p><p>Castor's status as a 'niche' crop historically meant a lack of scientific research interest, largely grown by small farmers with low yield performance, Haviv says. That castor can be used as aviation fuel, and can be grown in marginal and semi-arid soils, creates an opportunity for large-scale African cultivation, Haviv says. 'You won't compete with the food chain,' Haviv says. 'This is the direction the world should go in.'</p><p>Kenya oil refinery eyes biofuel production to revive KPRL</p><p>The EU in 2022 banned palm oil and soybean as a biofuel or biodiesel feedstock. Castor oil is renewable, biodegradable, has a low sulphur content and is considered by the EU as a green fuel. In October, Casterra announced the delivery of over 100 tonnes of castor seeds to an African customer. The seeds were cultivated in Kenya and processed at a production facility near Naivasha, which opened in August.</p><p>Haviv aims to develop more new castor plant varieties adapted to local conditions. He wants to expand Casterra's existing partnership with Italian oil major Eni SpA to grow castor for grain, which would then be crushed for oil. Eni is betting on biofuels as part of its strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p>Gates doubles down on GMOs to fix African agriculture during Nigeria trip</p><p>Kenya and Brazil, Haviv says, are being evaluated as possible sites for the project. That would remove the need to ship the castor oil, and would open the door to cosmetic and medical applications as well as aviation fuel, he says.</p><p>A longer-term aim is for the company to become a supplier of castor-based oil, rather than just grain, with its own crushing factory. The main bottleneck, Haviv says, is growing enough castor. 'It's a huge opportunity for Africa.'</p><p>There's no other solution besides castor oil for the 'holy grail' of decarbonising aviation fuel, says Casterra CEO Yoash Zohar. Africa could also use castor oil to supply lubricants and varnishers.

The need for innovation in African agriculture has never been so urgent as climate change and global regulatory pressures raise the heat. Markets such as the EU are demanding more climate-related trade regulations, such as traceability and green certification, which many African farmers cannot provide, says Louis van Ravesteyn, head of agribusiness at Standard Bank in South Africa. The regulatory push, he says, 'will result in a new holistic approach to African agriculture. The focus of financial institutions, he says, needs to be food security, which can be improved by encouraging practices such as crop diversification, inter-cropping, agroforestry and precision agriculture.

The group not only promotes smallholder farmers' rights, but also trains them to farm better, as well as instructing them in the storage and exchange of seeds.</p><p>There is a disconnect between what vegetables people will buy and eat and what crop varieties can be improved. Consumers, for example in Kenya, are discerning and want millet of a certain colour.</p><p>Farmers on the ground work with people like Wambui Wakahiu, programme officer for Seed Savers, which has some 86,000 farmers throughout the country in its network, translating into about 405,000 beneficiaries.</p><p>When The Africa Report visited the Seed Savers training centre in Gilgil, workers were loading a truck with seed for farmers in northern Turkana County, who had their whole season wiped out after major floods.

When families have nothing, we have conflicts in the families and the communities. We don't have big shambas (farms), but we have more product. We do crop rotation, and we do indigenous vegetables, but also others that fall under market demand, which is why I'm planting spinach, spider plants, and nightshade,' she says, noting three major cash crops that she sells at market.</p><p>She also learned how to save seeds, and now she has a group of 27 female farmers who save seeds, which are stored in their community seed bank in her back yard.</p><p>They save seeds and they also save money, because the farmers can exchange seeds for free and do not have to buy imputs from farming shops.</p><p>'Those seeds (from shops) are mixed with stones and soil, and sometimes you get seeds that are dried with electricity, so they don't germinate well,' says Wangui.</p><p>'Seed banks are not museums.

Sand To Green, bringing soil back to life (Morocco)Benjamin Rombaut, Gautier de Carcou\u00ebt and Wissal Ben Moussa are committed to transforming the desert into plant-covered plains with fruit trees and aromatic herbs. Graduates of the I\u00e9seg management school, Sciences Po Lille, the Hassan II agronomic and veterinary institute and AgroParisTech, these young entrepreneurs have come together around an ambitious project: Sand to Green. The startup wants to convert the arid lands of the Sahara into abundant orchards in order to combat deforestation and desertification. To achieve this, the Franco-Moroccan startup is using cutting-edge technologies and drawing inspiration from oasis agroforestry techniques to implement regenerative agriculture, making lifeless soils fertile and creating new carbon sinks. After a few years' trial on a five-hectare area in southern Morocco and raising $1m in funds, the team, which uses solar energy to desalinate seawater and irrigate the land, is preparing to extend the project across the kingdom before exporting to Mauritania, Senegal, Namibia, and Egypt.

There was no data for 2022. According to the statistics, no other species were imported besides African mahogany.</p><p>The URA provided data for a slightly different period: 2,561 entries of mahogany from the DRC were recorded between July 2019 and June 2022, worth USh8.9bn (about $2.3m). Its quantity is hard to compute because kilograms and cubic metres are mixed in the entries. Additionally, there is no quantity for 89 of the entries. The URA describes this as human error.</p><p>At the time of the interview with The Africa Report, Erimu bought each piece of timber for USh200,000 (roughly $52 for one piece), although the prices fluctuate.</p><p>This means that the company spends about $460,000 on timber a year; 95% of it being spent on Congolese timber.</p><p>Erimu's Mayanja says that the company utilises at least 14 trucks of timber yearly at a minimum guess. But the number can increase to 20 trucks depending on furniture demand. A truck normally delivers 600-700 pieces of timber.</p><p>Ngabwah said that from May 2022 to November 2023 the prison had spent USh2bn on timber, which comes to about $530,000 if you factor in the exchange rate.</p><p>'I would say mahogany makes up 80%,' he says, referring to the prison wood order. That would mean that around $420,000 was spent on purchasing Congolese timber.</p><p>At Nile House, Opio said they use not less than 3,000 pieces of mahogany per year, which translates to $156,000, basing the price on the same 2023 benchmark. According to our calculations, three companies spend more money on imports than what is captured in the URA's tax database.</p><p>Unreliable statistics</p><p>Any statistical evidence showing that the local furniture industry consumes more timber than officially imported would be a clear indication 'that they are consuming illegal wood,' says forestry assistant commissioner Kazungu.</p><p>Perhaps, he says, an argument can be made that 'there seems to be much more [timber] volume than what is reported'.</p><p>Kazungu hastens to add that there is a need to be 'sure that the volume of wood reported in the FAO statistics resonates with the wood that we are consuming as a local furniture industry.' If it's not, then it's not right, he says.</p><p>Professor Banana says data from the URA is not reliable. According to statistics from the URA and UNComrade, Uganda has only imported mahogany and two shipments of iroko, another rare hardwood, worth $9,989 over the past three years.</p><p>Another possible indicator of illegal timber on the market in Kampala is the species on offer.

While they offer an opportunity for farmers to adopt more sustainable practices, the challenges of complexity, bureaucracy, and insufficient compensation have hindered a widespread uptake.</p><p>To receive the 'basic' eco-payment, Czech farmers must fulfil several measures, such as leaving un-mown areas, crop diversification, or allocating a buffer zone along the watercourse. There is also an option to receive a 'premium' eco-payment for farmers keeping a larger share of areas unused for production.</p><p>As EURACTIV.cz learnt, 22,092 applications were submitted this year for the basic eco-payment and 50 for premium eco-payment. In total, around 30,000 Czech farmers applied for direct payments.</p><p>Regarding particular eco-scheme measures, only limited ones are applied in practice. According to Jan Stefl, vice-president of the Czech Association of private farming, most farmers opted for fallow lands and substituted some with protein crops, taking advantage of the EU's temporary derogation.</p><p>One of the main obstacles farmers face is the insufficient financial motivation to implement other eco-schemes measures which would benefit nature - for example, landscape features, such as copses. </p><p>Czech farmers argue that low subsidy rates for establishing and maintaining such elements discourage their expansion. Moreover, the complexity and bureaucratic nature of the eco-scheme rules have deterred many farmers from participating fully.</p><p>\"Good intentions have been devalued by imperfect implementation,\" Vladim\u00edr P\u00edcha from the Agricultural Association of the Czech Republic told EURACTIV.cz.

In Germany, even farmers willing and motivated to implement nature-based solutions find that the country's catalogue of eco schemes confronts them with insurmountable barriers to participation in the measures. According to preliminary data the agriculture ministry published in June, the eco-schemes fell through with many farmers and were taken up much less than expected. Some schemes, such as planting strips of wildflowers, were implemented on less than 1% of the number of hectares initially planned for, while agroforestry was only implemented on a total of 50 hectares across all of Germany. I am not participating in any eco-scheme,\" Ottmar Ilchmann, a dairy and arable farmer in Northern Germany, told EURACTIV. After going through the catalogue of eco-schemes, the farmer concluded that entry barriers for those measures applicable to his grassland-heavy farm were too high for a small business. Even for permanent pasture, one of the eco-schemes most widely taken up in Germany, collecting the necessary proof to be submitted with the CAP funds application is costly and time-consuming, and the financial reward is insufficient to justify the extra investment, Ilchmann explained. Especially for small farms, this means that the financial risk taken outweighs the potential reward, he added. \"For me, many eco-schemes are not worth it because the risk of making a mistake [and thus not receiving the premium] is too high,\" he said.", "There are also questions about the practice's profitability, which requires specialised machines.

Meet Senegal's new guard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Senegal, the installation of the new government continues. Following the Council of Ministers meeting on 2 May, a dozen officials were appointed to state agencies. The new president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was sworn in on 2 April, has put together a team comprising members of his party, the Patriotes Africains du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal pour le Travail, l'Ethique et la Fraternit\u00e9 (PASTEF), many of whom are little known to the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_2</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Skilled in combat sports such as Kung Fu and Vovinam, Senegal's new president is known for his consistently calm demeanor and strong ability to listen. The former tax and property inspector has never held elected office before. Will Faye be able to keep a cool head in the face of the trials and tribulations of power? 'He is a man with a [personal] touch and strategic intelligence. He has the qualities needed to lead. Everything else is a team affair,' says one of his ministers.</p><p>The Africa Report takes a look at the leading figures in this team, the faces of what new prime minister Ousmane Sonko calls the 'breakaway' administration.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_3</p><p>Allies and close associates of Faye and Sonko describe their relationship as 'complementary' and say that their trust in each other is unshakeable. Faye even named his first son after Ousmane Sonko. The two men, who have worked together for more than 10 years, are now governing Senegal as an unprecedented pair. But had it not been for Sonko's legal odyssey - which ruled him out of the last election - he would have been the one occupying the presidential palace. So will they succeed in avoiding division? 'Many of those who raise this question are unaware of just how close the two men are,' says one politician who knows them well. Sonko, now Senegal's prime minister, founded PASTEF in 2014, and has reclaimed his place as its president, after the party was dissolved by Macky Sall's administration in July 2023. His first challenge will be to win the confidence of the members of the assembly. Sonko has until 2 July to deliver his general policy speech to MPs. However, the lawmakers have the option of voting a motion of no confidence, which would lead to the dissolution of his government.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_4</p><p>The faithful friend: Birame Souleye Diop</p><p>Birame Souleye Diop, the former tax inspector who is now minister of energy, has inherited a strategic post in the new government - at a time when oil and gas production in Senegal is eagerly awaited. The first vice-president of PASTEF, Diop is one of the founding members of the party, as is Waly Diouf Bodian, the new director of the Autonomous Port of Dakar.</p><p>PASTEF was founded in 2014 on the foundations of the first trade union established in the tax and property department, then led by Sonko. Diop was elected as a member of parliament in the 2022 legislative elections, and chairs the Yewwi Askan Wi parliamentary group in the National Assembly, a post from which he will soon vacate.</p><p>The pillar: EL Malick Ndiaye</p><p>Ndiaye, PASTEF's national secretary for communication, is a loyal supporter of both Faye and Sonko and has been involved in each one of their battles since 2021. This current minister of infrastructure and transport was on the front line when Faye and Sonko were imprisoned - as he was, too, under President Macky Sall. But as soon as he was released from prison, he was by Faye's side, joining PASTEF shortly after it was founded and becoming one of its pillars.</p><p>The veteran: Abass Fall</p><p>The PASTEF coordinator in Dakar is older than his other colleagues in the party and has not been active in the Senegalese administration, as they have. Abass Fall is nonetheless one of the party's most active members and a close friend of the president. Along with MP Ayib Daff\u00e9, he is leading ruling party's charge within the National Assembly.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_5</p><p>The private secretary: Mary Teuw Niane</p><p>Mary Teuw Niane, Sall's former minister of higher education (2012-2019), was one of the first people to be appointed to a role by the new president on 3 April. A member of the 'Diomaye pr\u00e9sident' coalition, he supported the opposition in the run-up to the July 2022 legislative elections, after resigning from his comfortable position as chairman of the board of Petrosen, the national hydrocarbons company. His candidacy for the 2024 presidential election was subsequently rejected.</p><p>Niane's appointment to the central position of chief of staff has drawn some criticism from political observers. A former member of Abdoulaye Wade's Parti D\u00e9mocratique S\u00e9n\u00e9galais (PDS) and a former minister under Sall, the mathematician is one of the few veterans of the country's political life to work closely with Faye. The latter has retained a number of government experts, such as the minister-secretary general of the presidency, Oumar Samba Ba.</p><p>The experienced ally: Moustapha Mamba Guirassy</p><p>Like Mary Teuw Niane, the current minister of education is no novice in politics having served as minister of communication under Abdoulaye Wade and previously as mayor of the southeastern town of Kedougou. He became close to Sonko when the latter's legal troubles began in early 2021. Guirassy subsequently joined the Yewwi Askan Wi opposition coalition, alongside experienced politicians such as former PDS executive A\u00efda Mbodj, former prime minister Aminata Tour\u00e9 and former minister Habib Sy. He was Faye's campaign director and strongly believed in Sonko's strategy of alliances.</p><p>The economist: Khadim Bamba Diagne</p><p>Diagne holds a doctorate in economics from the Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar and is the scientific director of the economic and monetary research analysis laboratory. Although he has no official role within the party, this specialist in financial matters is part of the PASTEF ecosystem. 'He is regularly consulted on many issues, and is highly regarded by the party's top brass,' says a source close to Faye.</p><p>The lawyer: Amadou Ba</p><p>This member of PASTEF has been extensively engaged in the legal affairs of the party for quite some time. It was his training as a lawyer that tipped the balance when it came to appointing a proxy candidate for Faye, who was in prison when he filed his candidacy, and Ba was a key player in the legal battle to ensure that Faye's application was validated. He is also adept at effectively communicating with the media.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_6</p><p>The diplomat: Yassine Fall</p><p>It comes as no surprise that this former United Nations official has been appointed to minister of African integration and foreign affairs. An economist by training, Yassine Fall worked for the UN for some 20 years. Leading her own movement, Def Lila War (Do Your Duty), she opted out of the February 2019 presidential election to support Sonko, who came in third place.</p><p>She then decided to merge her political platform with PASTEF, and in 2022 became the latter's vice-president in charge of international issues. Between 2021 and 2023, Fall made several trips abroad to meet human rights organisations, and travelled frequently between Senegal and the United States to raise awareness among American officials of Sonko's cause. As foreign minister, Fall will be working with Amadou Ch\u00e9rif Diouf, the secretary of state for Senegalese living abroad. Diouf, who is PASTEF's national finance secretary, has lived in Canada for many years.</p><p>The money man: Cheikh Diba</p><p>Cheikh Diba, a tax and property inspector, is a graduate of the 2005-2007 class of France's prestigious (but now defunct) \u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration, as are Faye and Diop. However, a number of party executives have expressed their surprise at the appointment of the former director of budget programming.</p><p>A senior civil servant, Diba has spent a large part of his career in the budget department, having previously worked for the tax authorities, but has never been active within PASTEF as he was in France when the party was founded. He expressed an interest in the anti-system party on his return to Dakar in 2015. For a while, he was approached to join the party's economic affairs committee - a choice endorsed by Sonko - but eventually gave up his active involvement. He resurfaced in the run-up to the presidential election on 24 March, and played an active role in the negotiations with Sall that led to Faye and Sonko's release from prison.</p><p>The ally: Cheikh Tidiane Dieye</p><p>Like Guirassy and Niane, the minister for water is one of PASTEF's political allies. He was a founding member of the main opposition coalition Yewwi Askan Wi, Cheikh Tidiane Dieye - along with Habib Sy. Dieye ran what he describes as a 'support bid' for Faye in the presidential election, withdrawing his candidacy on the eve of the election. The sociologist and development specialist, who is very close to both Sonko and Faye, is also one of the vice-presidents of the Ziguinchor departmental council.</p><p>The spokesman: Moustapha Sarr\u00e9</p><p>The government spokesman's first media appearance did not go unnoticed. During an interview on Senegalese radio station RFM on 21 April, the minister for vocational training warned MPs against any attempts to force the prime minister to dissolve his government, saying a motion of censure would amount to 'rowing against the vision of the majority of the people'.</p><p>Sarr\u00e9 joined PASTEF when the political party was in turmoil, as Sonko, then an opposition politician, began taking an increasingly radical stance against those in power. 'These were difficult times for the party. Many members deserted the party. There were often [only] six or seven of us at meetings,' says one PASTEF member. Sarr\u00e9 worked hard to strengthen the political group and see it through those testing times, eventually joining its political bureau.</p><p>The patron saint of women: Ma\u00efmouna Dieye</p><p>Since 2017, Dieye, the new minister for family and solidarity, has been coordinating PASTEF's women's movement, which she set up after joining the party. Elected in January 2022 as mayor of Patte d'oie - one of Dakar's 19 communes - Dieye was arrested in August 2023 and charged with 'calling for insurrection', a few days after Sonko's imprisonment. She is among thousands of political prisoners and PASTEF activists who were granted amnesty under the law passed by the National Assembly on March 6. This law pertains to demonstrations occurring between February 2021 and February 2024.</p><p>The academic: Daouda Ngom</p><p>A specialist in ecology, agroforestry and sustainable development, Ngom has been chosen to head the environment ministry. This teacher, who is also a researcher in the plant biology department of the Universit\u00e9 Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar, is not a longterm PASTEF activist. However, he swiftly garnered unanimous support from members of the political party Mouvement National des Cadres Patriotes, led by Faye, eventually assuming the role of deputy leader. In 2022, when Faye was promoted to the position of secretary-general, Ngom took over the leadership of the party.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_7</p><p>The chief of staff: Papa Mada Ndour</p><p>Ndour was once considered for the post of chief of protocol at the presidential palace, a role he already held at the PASTEF office, and which led him to the presidential palace during the meeting between Faye, Sonko and Sall.

The establishment of a road to Mpondwe of a new timber park, the first of its kind in the DRC, pushed traders northwards to Lia from 2019 onwards.</p><p>A large timber station opened in Lia in 2022, bringing in more money, traffic, people and cut wood, as evident in the images.</p><p>Timber dealers mention several provinces - North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo and Haut-Uele - as the source of timber that arrives at the Uganda border. In Ituri, they spoke of Nia Nia, a hamlet located in Okapi Wildlife Reserve, a rich tropical rainforest. It is situated to the extreme west, where Ituri borders Tshopo and Haut-Uele. Despite the huge volumes of timber at Lia, there is little presence of authorities.</p><p>The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) office in charge of clearing goods passing through Lia is staffed with two people. Across the border on the Congo side in the Ituri region, there is a one-room office occupied by a few Congolese officials.</p><p>There are no scanners or weighing scales in Lia to check or weigh timber arriving or departing in trucks.</p><p>On the ground</p><p>In August last year, The Africa Report visited Lia and spoke to numerous people who explained how the logging business works. According to a local politician, as many as 10 trucks per day arrive from the DRC, depending on the season.</p><p>The timber is unloaded, and money is exchanged. If the wood quality is not good enough, the driver has to go back to the DRC to bring more timber while the buyer waits for their full load, which could be up to two weeks.</p><p>Lia doesn't operate like other borders where trucks or people pass through to their destination. It's a stopping place for some, working as a timber exchange point and market of sorts. Uganda and Kenya timber buyers - always stationed at the border - with money and dependable connections in the DRC contract their Congolese counterparts to source timber, according to a person who works in Lia.</p><p>The buyers partially pay in advance for the raw materials and sometimes buy wood harvesting machines for their Congolese partners who go to the forests to cut trees, especially during the rainy season.</p><p>The cut wood is later transported to the border during the dry season because movement is easier. It can take as long as six months for timber to be delivered. Once it is received, the pieces are counted and confirmed to be of the right quality, and the buyer pays the remaining balance, according to one wood dealer.</p><p>French disconnection</p><p>About 80% of the timber that arrives at Lia is en route, mostly to Kenya, explained a person working at the border, saying Uganda officials merely facilitate its movement. The small portion of timber destined for the local market is cleared, taxed and transported to Kampala.</p><p>Ugandan officials \"don't care about taxes on materials being exported\", our source said, so \"they don't bother looking at the documents\" because Uganda is only for transit.</p><p>While more than 200 languages are spoken in the DRC, French is one of the primary four official languages. But Congolese who bring timber to the border come with 'tricky' and 'not serious' documents written in French, according to one person who asked not to be identified.</p><p>'It's very rare to find that they have the documents the way you want them 100%,' the source said. 'We end up initiating documents from here.'</p><p>Another person working in the wood industry at the border explained that timber arrives without the requisite documents due to corruption in the DRC.</p><p>In Haut-Uele, traders mention Isiro, Rungu and Dungu as areas where they source wood. In June 2023, DRC forest monitoring group Observatoire de la Gouvernance Foresti\u00e8re (OGF) organised a fact-finding mission to Haut-Uele, where it found that the province had not issued logging permits to artisanal operators for two years despite receiving more than 80 applications, yet artisanal operators were logging without permits, including in forest reserves.</p><p>The OGF report said it 'encountered a truck loading a batch of sawn timber for export to Uganda\" and that 'all this wood was cut without authorisation'.</p><p>In the eastern Congo, money for permits is paid to individuals and roadblock operators rather than government offices, which explains the discrepancy in documents and stamps that truckers have at the border.</p><p>'Sometimes people receive money stamps on receipts and let trucks pass through. People arrive with stamped receipts and no other documents,' says the wood industry worker.</p><p>People involved in illegal logging take home triple the income of what legal logging pays in the DRC, says Moise Mugaruka Kajiwami, the head of the Forest Management Bureau in North Kivu.</p><p>'Most of it is in the hands of armed men, then operators who abandon it and join the rebels. The latter work to increase the Ugandan economy to the disadvantage of that of the DRC,' says Kajiwami.</p><p>No permit? No problem</p><p>What is always missing, according to Lia timber clearing agent Rashid Kabuye, is the certificate of origin, because the administrative state is centralised in the DRC.</p><p>'For a person to get [the certificate], he has to go to Kinshasa, which is very far, and you have to fly as there are no roads,' he says. The Congolese capital is around 1,700km from the Ituri region.</p><p>Essylot Lubala, technical advisor of the OGF, says the excuse that dealers can't go to Kinshasa to obtain a certificate of origin should not be accepted in Uganda.</p><p>'If there is no certificate of origin, timber should not be allowed to enter Uganda, or East Africa territory,' he says. If wood without a certificate is blocked, the owners will be forced to go to Kinshasa to acquire it. 'It's through the acquisition of the document that legal compliance and tax obligations will be met.'</p><p>Although an agreement for the regulation of logging in the provinces of Ituri, Tsopo and North Kivu was signed last year in Bunia, the process is moot without enforcement, Kajiwami said.</p><p>The overall lack of infrastructure also hampers paperwork and operations.</p><p>'The offices around here have no computers, no electricity - they are still using pen and paper,' he adds.</p><p>One Congolese trucker who has ferried timber and asked not to be identified, candidly tells The Africa Report that logging is an 'atrocious' job, but that corruption is part of his daily life as he moves timber across the border.</p><p>Before reaching the Uganda border, the truck will have paid about $230 on checkpoints, he says. 'These are amounts with no receipts,' he adds.</p><p>\"If you don't accept corruption, you have to provide genuine verification [of wood] and that's different,' he says, indicating that a document showing a 20-tonne load may be for a load of 60 tonnes. 'But that's how we eat.'</p><p>If truckers are given documents that indicate they have a 3-5 tonne load, they have no way of verifying it before they hit the road - and the border check.</p><p>'Because we can't check, we have to bribe. Even with the ... [right] documents there might be an extra five tonnes for him, for his pocket, so he will let them go,' adds the trucker. \"That's how it works.\"</p><p>Researchers published a study of the park on the road leading to Mpondwe, which indicated a near-total failure to issue formal timber certification on the DRC side.</p><p>'Some 93% of what arrived at the Congo park had no legal logging permits,' Paul Omar Cerutti, head of the DRC office at the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) and the study's co-author tells The Africa Report.</p><p>This is how we do it here</p><p>There is another group of Congolese traders who bring timber to Lia without a prior arrangement with buyers. They either sell it quickly or wait for days until they secure a buyer. As a result, the border has become a marketplace.</p><p>URA spokesperson Ibrahim Bbosa tells The Africa Report that the practice of traders waiting at the border for their Congolese counterparts to deliver raw material is acceptable as long as the timber is cleared by the customs officials.</p><p>However, he also said trade in timber at the border, which is booming in Lia, is not permissible under the law.</p><p>Besides traders significantly under-declaring their raw material tonnage to cheat taxes, bribery also aids the movement of timber trucks loaded at checkpoints and weighbridges en route to Kampala or Kenya.</p><p>A Ugandan timber trader who showed his tax papers to The Africa Report just days after collecting timber from Lia had roughly paid only 20% of the tax he should have been charged.</p><p>Why traders moved to Lia</p><p>Depending on who you speak to, there are several reasons why traders stopped using the Mpondwe border, but danger coupled with the restive area certainly comes into play.</p><p>Nathan Biryomumaisho, a wood dealer, said the move was due to insecurity, while Lia clearing agent Kabuye said fighting in the North Kivu region pushed wood dealers to source wood in other areas.</p><p>'Rebels were hiding in the forests where these guys were getting timber,' says Kabuye.</p><p>'Wherever rebels found them, they would attack and kill them. They [loggers] diverted to other forests where there is no insecurity and those forests are closer to the northern routes,' he adds. Rashid Muhindo, a clearing agent who moved to northern Uganda, agrees. 'Rebels were burning trucks and people were losing lives,' he says.</p><p>However, Ngasu Jackson Bwambale, a forest ranger in charge of the area around Mpondwe, says traders felt they were being overtaxed.</p><p>'Traders are like pastoralists. They transferred their trade from Mpondwe to Lia ... and established another timber entry route,' he says. 'They shifted due to high taxes.' But taxes on timber are uniform across all borders, so they found a place where documents were not a key requirement.</p><p>Blame it on the border</p><p>In Kampala, government officials don't dispute what The Africa Report investigation reveals but argue that it is difficult to authenticate products that come from eastern DRC, which has been at war for decades resulting in weak administration.</p><p>Bbosa says contraband that crosses the Uganda-DRC border is due to the lack of control posts.</p><p>'What is still a problem and is difficult to account for is timber that could come in through our porous borders,' he says.</p><p>The ease with which traders turned Lia into a market without checks and easy bribes has made the hamlet a hub for traders.</p><p>Less than 30km south of Lia is the Vurra border, the second-largest and most-developed border, with everything that a smooth, legal timber trade requires. It is not used by timber traders.</p><p>When told about the outcome of the 2023 CIFOR-ICRAF study analysing the park near Mpondwe, Bbosa is surprised. 'I think it's good information for us to act on,' he says. \"We as tax administrators can act on such information. If there is a loophole that needs to be closed, that would be an interesting trigger.'</p><p>Bob Kazungu, Uganda's acting assistant commissioner for forestry at the Ministry for Water and Environment, says in the past they used to get forged documents which they were able to deal with but ruled out the scenario of timber passing through official borders without any documentation.</p><p>His office hadn't heard of this lack of papers 'because if it had, we would have swung into serious action,' he says. \"You're raising an issue which is going to amount to a serious investigation.\"</p><p>Yet other studies, including a Chatham House document from 2014, show that 87% of logging in the DRC was illegal.</p><p>Lia timber trade welcomed by locals</p><p>When the illegal wood route moved to Lia, the money followed. The rural community has welcomed strangers over the past two years - timber dealers. The?community is excited by the trade boom, but has a few reservations, according to Ariko Moses, a councillor representing the Arua city council, the area under which Lia is located.</p><p>In mid-2023, new timber dealers were arriving in the area from Kasese, Uganda, Moses told The Africa Report in August. Their arrival raised security concerns because some rebel groups operate along the DRC border in Kasese, he said.</p><p>'People from Kasese, the number increased this year ... we asked the security to investigate them ... there are people who are loading [raw wood], there are people who are counting timber going out,' he said. 'We discovered together with security that they are genuine businesspeople, and they have work permits,' he added.</p><p>Local politicians, Moses said, are happy with the boom in timber entering Uganda through Lia. \"It's aiding the community to develop and is a source of revenue: dealers are renting spaces where they keep their raw material as well as houses.\"</p><p>Most importantly, it has been a source of jobs for youth who load and unload timber on trucks or guard timber stockpiles. The city administration is planning to tax the timber dealers so that it can generate revenue, Moses said, but admits they will be cautious.</p><p>'We want to collect our taxes from them ... we want a moderate [tax] rate. We don't want to overtax them, you know, taxes can also chase people. Once we chase them, it will have many implications,' he said.</p><p>'If we chase them because of tax, the voters will turn against us. We don't want to collapse the business,' he added.</p><p>Besides these two types of illicit timber cross-border movement - with suspect documents or no documents at all - a third type of wood hustling, as detailed in part two of our four-part series, is smuggling.</p><p>COMING UP, IN THIS INVESTIGATION:</p><p>1) Timber hustling: Lia, a thriving hub for Congolese mahogany trafficked to Uganda, Kenya</p><p>2) 'Big men', an ugly history and the ruthless Congo Basin timber smuggling business</p><p>3) In Kampala, 'Made in Uganda' furniture pride obscures 'open secret' of illicit Congolese timber</p><p>4) Kenya talks big on climate, while illegal timber flows in daily from the DRC</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": [". . [right] documents there might be an extra five tonnes for him, for his pocket, so he will let them go,' adds the trucker. \"That's how it works. Researchers published a study of the park on the road leading to Mpondwe, which indicated a near-total failure to issue formal timber certification on the DRC side. Some 93% of what arrived at the Congo park had no legal logging permits,' Paul Omar Cerutti, head of the DRC office at the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) and the study's co-author tells The Africa Report. This is how we do it hereThere is another group of Congolese traders who bring timber to Lia without a prior arrangement with buyers. They either sell it quickly or wait for days until they secure a buyer. As a result, the border has become a marketplace. URA spokesperson Ibrahim Bbosa tells The Africa Report that the practice of traders waiting at the border for their Congolese counterparts to deliver raw material is acceptable as long as the timber is cleared by the customs officials.

While I would tweak this slightly to read men *and women*, the sentiment remains just as relevant - if not more so- today. And these are clearly words that Ferdinand Jolly lives by. At a time when bigger was seen as better when it comes to fields, the farmer in Ittre, some 40 minutes away from Brussels, took it upon himself to plant rows of trees to divide up his fields. And it was in the shade of those trees, now towering over us, that I stood, together with a gaggle of journalists, Commission officials - including Vice President Frans Timmermans - and Ferdinand's son, Christophe, who chose to forgo a career in banking in favour of the farm. The farm, which produces a mix of cereals and other crops, including wheat, barley, spelt, potato, chicory and strawberries alongside agroforestry - the first of its kind in the country - clearly places nature at its core. Asked why, Ferdinand gives a very simple answer. \"It's our garden,\" he says with a shrug. The father-son farming duo remain convinced that the benefits of leaving space for nature is just good sense. In terms of biodiversity, soil health and erosion, cooling crops, organic matter, the list goes on - it just makes sense,\" Ferdinand says, appearing mildly confused when we query whether he sees the loss of the space on his farm as an issue. And their approach seems to be paying dividends.", "The farm grows crops both organically and conventionally side by side and is low-till rather than no-till. In this way, they get the best of both worlds, Christophe explains. \"You can be a bad organic farmer or a good conventional farmer,\" he points out, envisioning a future where the two systems 'merge' - or at least are able to be inspired one by the other. In doing so, the farm is the living embodiment of the idea of 'breaking silos', so often bandied around in Brussels, but so rarely acted upon. Meanwhile, the farm thinks in generations, rather than harvest cycles. My dad planted it, I'm looking after it but probably my children will be the ones to harvest it,\" Christophe said of the agroforestry plantation. It begs the question; what would happen if politicians thought in generations rather than election cycles?

At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.

Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan.</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We have made good progress against our climate targets:</p><p>By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity - significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the third consecutive year we hit our target.</p><p>As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A]</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%.</p><p>We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Driving towards a net-zero future</emphasis></p><p>We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition.

Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>ENDS</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and performance please read the full report, online here:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at Shell's 2024 AGM. Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too.</p><p>I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to\u00a0produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value with less emissions</emphasis></p><p>At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to\u00a0our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and shareholder support</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I\u00a0appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to\u00a0our\u00a0next engagement in April 2024.</p><p>The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update.</p><p>This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at\u00a0our\u00a0Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board\u00a0and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sir Andrew Mackenzie</emphasis></p><p>Chair</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Executive Officer's introduction</emphasis></p><p>This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we\u00a0published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our\u00a0progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for\u00a0energy will only grow.</p><p>At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero.</p><p>I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in\u00a0the direction of our strategy.</p><p>Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the\u00a0world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to\u00a0use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to\u00a0provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Progress towards our targets</emphasis></p><p>Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with\u00a0renewable energy.</p><p>We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of\u00a0methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of\u00a0the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value, less emissions</emphasis></p><p>At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In\u00a0this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the\u00a0same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In\u00a0Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as\u00a0biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future.</p><p>Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on\u00a0delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing emissions from production</emphasis></p><p>We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen.</p><p>We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It\u00a0continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as\u00a0wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by\u00a0replacing coal.</p><p>In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to\u00a0lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint\u00a0venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by\u00a0more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities.</p><p>The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around\u00a080% less carbon dioxide emissions over its</p><p>operating\u00a0life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting our customers as they decarbonise</emphasis></p><p>We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have\u00a0competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and\u00a0identify clear regulatory support from governments. The\u00a0transport sector is a good example.</p><p>We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to\u00a0help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in\u00a0biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to\u00a0focus on four regional energy\u00a0and chemicals parks, we are\u00a0creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future.</p><p>As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a\u00a0new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most\u00a0progressive in the world.</p><p>Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is\u00a0selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to\u00a0retail customers. As a result, we\u00a0expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our\u00a0net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis></p><p>In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices\u00a0for our customers.</p><p>Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into\u00a0a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are\u00a0the investment case and the partner of choice through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wael Sawan</emphasis></p><p>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions.</emphasis></p><p>1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%.</p><p>5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly.</p><p>6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year.</p><p>7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]</p><p>Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.</p><p>8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge.</p><p>9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p>10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition.

Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil,\u00a080 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas.</p><p>As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be\u00a0linear, as different countries take different approaches and\u00a0move at different paces.</p><p>Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to\u00a0create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at\u00a0scale. This will\u00a0require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the\u00a0new\u00a0energy system.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Developing our beliefs</p><p>We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world.

In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the\u00a0second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in\u00a0electric vehicles.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the\u00a0last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year.

This increase was fuelled by\u00a0strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to\u00a0rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output.

This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of\u00a0coal,\u00a0gas\u00a0and electricity.</p><p>Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A].</p><p>Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in\u00a0energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement.</p><p>The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the\u00a0industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two\u00a0decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations.</p><p>More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply.

Today, SAF represents less than\u00a00.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to\u00a0grow with support from governments.</p><p>Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it\u00a0costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shipping</emphasis></p><p>Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of\u00a0shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with\u00a0conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25%\u00a0of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We\u00a0believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the\u00a0long term, but we see challenges with both of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buildings</emphasis></p><p>Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be\u00a0key to continuing this trend.</p><p>Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to\u00a02026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power</emphasis></p><p>Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023.</p><p>Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040.</p><p>We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their\u00a0scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of\u00a0national electricity grids.</p><p>We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon abatement</emphasis></p><p>We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and\u00a0standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could\u00a0emerge.</p><p>Carbon credits\u00a0may be used to compensate for emissions in\u00a0line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation.</p><p>The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to\u00a0limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a\u00a0year carbon removals, which will need to\u00a0be financed by\u00a0emitters purchasing carbon credits.</p><p>Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2emissions. While there are\u00a0only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.</p><p>Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023.

While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to\u00a0start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through\u00a0the 2030s.</p><p>We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one\u00a0that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions.</p><p>Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the\u00a0oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future.

Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and\u00a0Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our\u00a0products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are\u00a0reported as Scope 3.</p><p>Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand.

We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with\u00a0the use of LNG.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach.</p><p>As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry.</p><p>We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry.</p><p>We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non-operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments.</p><p>We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly.</p><p>In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for\u00a0cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives.</p><p>As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline.

We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced.</p><p>We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the\u00a0USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell\u00a0Pakistan.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Oil for lubricants and chemicals</p><p>Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry,\u00a0construction and road.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We are upgrading our retail network, with\u00a0expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to\u00a0supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils\u00a0used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support\u00a0the development of electric vehicle car batteries.</p><p>Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we\u00a0meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both\u00a0conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses.

Between now and 2030, we are\u00a0focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000\u00a0today.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future.</p><p>Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own\u00a0production and sales of biofuels in the coming years.</p><p>We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These\u00a0fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road\u00a0transport. To\u00a0support our production of biofuels, we\u00a0are\u00a0investing in new feedstocks through investments and\u00a0partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to\u00a0expand sales beyond our production volumes.</p><p>Through our Ra\u00edzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and\u00a0sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on\u00a0the\u00a0environment and food supplies.</p><p>Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the\u00a0largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power</emphasis></p><p>We will continue to grow our integrated power business with\u00a0selective investments in renewable power generation. We\u00a0will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our\u00a0ventures programme and investments in research and\u00a0development.</p><p>We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our\u00a0strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to\u00a0decarbonise our own operations.</p><p>Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at\u00a0around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.</p><p>Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing for the future (2030+)</emphasis></p><p>This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon\u00a0capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030.</p><p>We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to\u00a0deliver affordable low-cost solutions to\u00a0our customers.</p><p>We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be\u00a0directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and removal</emphasis></p><p>We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations.</p><p>We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable\u00a0CCS projects.</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in\u00a0the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground.</p><p>In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning\u00a0global carbon market will be a critical enabler of\u00a0an accelerated energy transition.

The commissioning process is expected to begin in\u00a02024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p>In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects.</p><p>By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this\u00a0decade.</p><p>Shell is working with shipping companies to\u00a0help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim\u00a0of\u00a0switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in\u00a0the longer term.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Artificial intelligence for LNG</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by\u00a0around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment.</p><p>Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a\u00a0founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or\u00a0reporting beyond our operations.</p><p>We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future.</p><p>We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor\u00a0the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at\u00a0our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800\u00a0tonnes since\u00a02017.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Aggregated average performance of Oil and Gas Climate initiative companies.</p><p>[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in\u00a0our Upstream business</emphasis></p><p>In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects.</p><p>Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf\u00a0of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80%\u00a0over its operating life, compared with its original design. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of\u00a0creating more value with less emissions.</p><p>Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta.</p><p>We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the\u00a0emissions needed to develop the project.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Reducing routine flaring</p><p>We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target\u00a0is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us\u00a0to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022.</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field\u00a0(Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas\u00a0recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be\u00a0powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity.</p><p>Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in\u00a0the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by\u00a0transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany.</p><p>In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025.</p><p>When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane\u00a0liquefaction plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our\u00a0customers decarbonise without having to change their cars,\u00a0trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of\u00a0the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of\u00a0the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\u00edzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in\u00a02022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to\u00a0build in Brazil.</p><p>In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns\u00a0and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant\u00a0in the Netherlands.</p><p>The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than\u00a0half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of\u00a0global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in\u00a0Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari</p><p>Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to\u00a0meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our\u00a0public charging network, currently operates in around 33\u00a0countries.</p><p>We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in\u00a0the\u00a0world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000\u00a0kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year.</p><p>The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has\u00a0a\u00a0utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business.</p><p>In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in\u00a0the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000\u00a0charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400\u00a0additional charge points in development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power positions</emphasis></p><p>Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia.</p><p>In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power.</p><p>We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also\u00a0developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and\u00a0Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands.</p><p>In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust\u00a0West.</p><p>We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in\u00a0select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in\u00a0late 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis></p><p>We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it\u00a0becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for\u00a0the future.</p><p>To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We\u00a0see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport.</p><p>At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in\u00a0the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of\u00a0our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and\u00a0industry.</p><p>In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up\u00a0to\u00a025 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by\u00a0the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity.</p><p>As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The\u00a0consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</emphasis></p><p>Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.</p><p>CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals\u00a0of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS\u00a0lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects.</p><p>By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of\u00a0increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000\u00a0tonnes a year [A].</p><p>Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2a year. The CO2will be shipped from two of \u00d8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea.</p><p>In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9\u00a0million tonnes of CO2equivalent by the end of 2023. In\u00a0addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the\u00a0world.</p><p>Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2a year. The\u00a0captured CO2will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast.\u00a0This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2emissions\u00a0by around 2% for 15 years from 2026.</p><p>[A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error.</p><p>In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in\u00a0the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK.</p><p>Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2a year.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Direct air capture</p><p>Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the\u00a0decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in\u00a0Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated energy hubs</emphasis></p><p>As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and\u00a0Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into\u00a0our existing facilities.</p><p>We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help\u00a0to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and\u00a0chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will\u00a0be\u00a0powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust\u00a0(noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and\u00a0stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest\u00a0customer, and Aramis, a joint venture.</p><p>As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holland Hydrogen 1</emphasis></p><p>Power: Hollandse Kusst (noord) wind farm - 759MW to Data centres and Shell Holland Hydrogen 1 - 200MW</p><p>C02:Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to Aramis CCS- 5 mpta store and Porthos CCS- 2.5 mpta store</p><p>Hydrogen: From Shell holland Hydrogen 1 200MW to Shell</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon credits</emphasis></p><p>Carbon credits can make an important contribution to our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. They\u00a0may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon\u00a0benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a\u00a0high quality.</p><p>We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.</p><p>We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the\u00a0market.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by\u00a0Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units.</p><p>Tracking SAF with blockchain</p><p>We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and\u00a0molecules.</p><p>Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with\u00a0Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to\u00a0delivery into aviation fuelling networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology and innovation</emphasis></p><p>Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our\u00a0company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49%\u00a0of our total expenditure on research and development, up\u00a0from around 41% in 2022.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Shell analysis of data published by peer companies (TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron) in annual reports with the note that definitions of R&amp;D vary between companies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:</p><p>Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.

This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and\u00a0CO2emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers.</p><p>We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in\u00a0the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus\u00a0on\u00a0electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and\u00a0materials.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Powering industry through investments</p><p>Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions.</p><p>In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to\u00a0help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies.

To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions.</p><p>In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p>We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal.</p><p>In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS.

Our investments in\u00a0producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell.

These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our\u00a0Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in\u00a0reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions intensity [A], [D]</emphasis></p><p>Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl.

Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.</p><p>Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of\u00a0five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing net carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of\u00a0the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050.</p><p>The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a\u00a02016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a\u00a0strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our\u00a0integrated power business, including renewable power, in\u00a0places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.</p><p>In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the\u00a0energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our\u00a0previous target of a 20% reduction.</p><p>Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a\u00a045% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The\u00a0chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030.</p><p>The change in our sales\u00a0of these products and services will also\u00a0reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the\u00a0adoption of public policies designed\u00a0to\u00a0encourage the energy transition.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in\u00a0grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)</emphasis></p><p>NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually.

That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world.</p><p>Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as\u00a0they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Including blending GLT</p><p>[B] Liquefied natural gas</p><p>[C] Liquefied petroleum</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris alignment</emphasis></p><p>The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\".</p><p>Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report\u00a0(AR6).</p><p>We start with the complete set of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios [A] and\u00a0then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We\u00a0then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\u00b0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.</p><p>These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5\u00b0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a\u00a0scenario exceeds 1.5\u00b0C before returning.</p><p>We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.

The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:</p><p>LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were\u00a0517\u00a0million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Energy transition and advisory votes</p><p>Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself.</p><p>As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p>Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that\u00a0reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a\u00a0\"significant best efforts basis\".</p><p>We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change.</p><p>It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which\u00a0has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world.</p><p>Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate standards and benchmarks</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition.</emphasis></p><p>They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties\u00a0and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria.</p><p>Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry.

Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a\u00a0company's targets and plans are aligned in the short-term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050).</p><p>In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the\u00a0highest score of four (strategic assessment) for\u00a0the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks\u00a0and\u00a0opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This\u00a0exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90)</p><p>In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\u00b0C benchmark.

The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May\u00a029, 2023.</p><p>We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that\u00a0our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome\u00a0in their assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures</emphasis></p><p>Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities.

The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact.

At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>\"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>\"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan.</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas.</p><p>We have made good progress against our climate targets:</p><p>By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity - significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the third consecutive year we hit our target.</p><p>As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A]</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe.</p><p>In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%.</p><p>We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Driving towards a net-zero future</emphasis>We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition.

Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to\u00a0our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and shareholder support</emphasis>In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I\u00a0appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to\u00a0our\u00a0next engagement in April 2024.</p><p>The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update.</p><p>This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at\u00a0our\u00a0Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board\u00a0and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sir Andrew Mackenzie</emphasis>Chair</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Executive Officer's introduction</emphasis></p><p>This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we\u00a0published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our\u00a0progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for\u00a0energy will only grow.</p><p>At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero.</p><p>I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in\u00a0the direction of our strategy.</p><p>Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the\u00a0world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to\u00a0use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to\u00a0provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Progress towards our targets</emphasis>Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with\u00a0renewable energy.</p><p>We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of\u00a0methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of\u00a0the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value, less emissions</emphasis>At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In\u00a0this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the\u00a0same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In\u00a0Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as\u00a0biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future.</p><p>Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on\u00a0delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing emissions from production</emphasis>We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen.</p><p>We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It\u00a0continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as\u00a0wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by\u00a0replacing coal.</p><p>In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to\u00a0lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint\u00a0venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by\u00a0more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities.</p><p>The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around\u00a080% less carbon dioxide emissions over its</p><p>operating\u00a0life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting our customers as they decarbonise</emphasis>We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have\u00a0competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and\u00a0identify clear regulatory support from governments. The\u00a0transport sector is a good example.</p><p>We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to\u00a0help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in\u00a0biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to\u00a0focus on four regional energy\u00a0and chemicals parks, we are\u00a0creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future.</p><p>As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a\u00a0new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most\u00a0progressive in the world.</p><p>Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is\u00a0selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to\u00a0retail customers. As a result, we\u00a0expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our\u00a0net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis>In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices\u00a0for our customers.</p><p>Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into\u00a0a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are\u00a0the investment case and the partner of choice through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wael Sawan</emphasis>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions.</emphasis></p><p>1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%.</p><p>5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly.</p><p>6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year.</p><p>7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]</p><p>Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.</p><p>8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge.</p><p>9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p>10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our journey towards net zero</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023</emphasis></p><p>Invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions, of our total capital spending of $24.4 billion in 2023. This included the acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe.Our Timi platform in Malaysia, mainly powered by solar and wind energy, started production. The Vito platform in the US Gulf of Mexico also started production, with 80% less CO2emissions expected over its lifetime compared with the original design.The Hollandse Kust Noord wind park off the coast of the Netherlands became operational.Shell's management team hosted its first Capital Markets Day in New York and set out Shell's strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.Achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 6-8% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016.Reduced our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 31% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016, more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030 on a net basis.Won majority shareholder support (80% of votes) for our energy transition progress at our Annual General Meeting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2022</emphasis></p><p>Completed the acquisition of renewable power company Sprng Energy, and took a final investment decision on Holland Hydrogen 1 and LNG expansion projects in Qatar.Introduced three new metrics in the annual bonus scorecard to reflect Shell's role in the energy transition.

This includes the well-to-tank emissions associated with the manufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell. Emissions associated with the manufacturing and use of non-energy products are excluded.2021 target 2-3%, 2022 target 3-4%, 2023 target 6-8%, all achieved. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity.Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by 2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category 11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The energy system: our beliefs</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in\u00a0many developing countries where security of\u00a0supply and stable prices are critical to their\u00a0development.</emphasis></p><p>The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250\u00a0mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil,\u00a080 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas.</p><p>As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be\u00a0linear, as different countries take different approaches and\u00a0move at different paces.</p><p>Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to\u00a0create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at\u00a0scale. This will\u00a0require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the\u00a0new\u00a0energy system.</p><p>Developing our beliefs</p><p>We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u00a0and several other external bodies.</p><p>We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs.</p><p>Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of\u00a0Technology. We will continue to challenge our own\u00a0beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Increasing demand</emphasis>Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and\u00a0industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more\u00a0than a quarter of the world's population\u00a0still lack basic\u00a0energy provisions.</p><p>Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the\u00a0Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the\u00a0second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in\u00a0electric vehicles.</p><p>Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023).</p><p>Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the\u00a0last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per\u00a0annum (mtpa) in\u00a01983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023.</p><p>Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a\u00a0figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and\u00a0can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe.</p><p>The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping.</p><p>Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by\u00a0strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to\u00a0rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Primary energy demand by region and energy source, 2023 (exajoule)</emphasis></p><p>[A] Electric renewables are dominated hydroelectricity, wind, and solar.

Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%.

The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heavy industry</emphasis>Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of\u00a0steel\u00a0and cement, which use high-temperature processes that\u00a0can\u00a0be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of\u00a0coal,\u00a0gas\u00a0and electricity.</p><p>Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A].</p><p>Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in\u00a0energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement.</p><p>The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the\u00a0industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two\u00a0decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations.</p><p>More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Light industry</emphasis>Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy\u00a0equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of\u00a0light\u00a0industry have already switched to electrification. We\u00a0see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also\u00a0needed to decarbonise the sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-energy use</emphasis>Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We\u00a0believe bio-feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this\u00a0sector.</p><p>Source: International Energy Agency.

Global CO2emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a\u00a0year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions.</p><p>Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio-alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.</p><p>[A] Noth-west European retail prices.[B] Beyond production costs, taxes significantly increase the price customers pay for biodiesel, diesel and gasoline.[C] Electric costs (0.2-0.6$kWh) adjusted for 2.4x higher efficiency of electric versus international combustion engine vehicles. Range shown is home/deport charging to highway fast charging.Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Passenger road transport</emphasis>Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25 million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40\u00a0million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by\u00a02030. The availability of charging points will be\u00a0critical for\u00a0the growth in electric vehicles.</p><p>The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is\u00a0in China, the world's largest car market, followed by\u00a0Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport</emphasis>Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or\u00a0hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and\u00a0customer preferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation</emphasis>Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a\u00a0credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than\u00a00.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to\u00a0grow with support from governments.</p><p>Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it\u00a0costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shipping</emphasis>Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of\u00a0shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with\u00a0conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25%\u00a0of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We\u00a0believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the\u00a0long term, but we see challenges with both of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buildings</emphasis></p><p>Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be\u00a0key to continuing this trend.</p><p>Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to\u00a02026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power</emphasis></p><p>Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023.</p><p>Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040.</p><p>We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their\u00a0scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of\u00a0national electricity grids.</p><p>We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon abatement</emphasis></p><p>We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and\u00a0standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could\u00a0emerge.</p><p>Carbon credits\u00a0may be used to compensate for emissions in\u00a0line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation.</p><p>The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to\u00a0limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a\u00a0year carbon removals, which will need to\u00a0be financed by\u00a0emitters purchasing carbon credits.</p><p>Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2emissions. While there are\u00a0only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.</p><p>Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023.

It supports our purpose</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">- to provide more and cleaner energy solutions</emphasis></p><p>Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to\u00a0start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through\u00a0the 2030s.</p><p>We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one\u00a0that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions.</p><p>Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the\u00a0oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions.</p><p>We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:</p><p>Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity.Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable.Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.</p><p>[A] Net absolute emissions cover the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from our energy products; these are calculated by product and allocated to businesses based on final point of sales, so emissions associated with upstream production are largely included under downstream as point of sale.</p><p>Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses.</p><p>The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and\u00a0Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our\u00a0products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in\u00a0Europe in 2023.</p><p>LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p>Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.</p><p>Source: US Department of Energy National Enerfy Technology Laboratory 2015</p><p>There are many opportunities for industries to cut carbon emissions by switching from coal to natural gas and LNG. Coal\u00a0accounts for more than 60% of the energy used across Asia to power heavy industries such as steel.</p><p>Source; Shell interpretation of Wood Mackenzie data.</p><p>LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is\u00a0scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG.</p><p>To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with\u00a0the use of LNG.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis>Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach.</p><p>As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry.</p><p>We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry.</p><p>We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non-operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard.</p><p>Working with others</p><p>Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions.</p><p>We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain.

Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maintaining oil production this decade</emphasis>Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023\u00a0had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to\u00a02030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments.</p><p>We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly.</p><p>In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for\u00a0cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives.</p><p>As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline.

We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced.</p><p>We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the\u00a0USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell\u00a0Pakistan.</p><p>Oil for lubricants and chemicals</p><p>Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry,\u00a0construction and road.</p><p>We are upgrading our retail network, with\u00a0expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to\u00a0supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils\u00a0used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support\u00a0the development of electric vehicle car batteries.</p><p>Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we\u00a0meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both\u00a0conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in\u00a0low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building for tomorrow (2025+)</emphasis></p><p>To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low-carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are\u00a0focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000\u00a0today.</p><p>We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future.</p><p>Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own\u00a0production and sales of biofuels in the coming years.</p><p>We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These\u00a0fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road\u00a0transport. To\u00a0support our production of biofuels, we\u00a0are\u00a0investing in new feedstocks through investments and\u00a0partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to\u00a0expand sales beyond our production volumes.</p><p>Through our Ra\u00edzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and\u00a0sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on\u00a0the\u00a0environment and food supplies.</p><p>Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the\u00a0largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power</emphasis></p><p>We will continue to grow our integrated power business with\u00a0selective investments in renewable power generation. We\u00a0will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our\u00a0ventures programme and investments in research and\u00a0development.</p><p>We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our\u00a0strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to\u00a0decarbonise our own operations.</p><p>Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at\u00a0around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.</p><p>[A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing for the future (2030+)</emphasis></p><p>This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon\u00a0capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030.</p><p>We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to\u00a0deliver affordable low-cost solutions to\u00a0our customers.</p><p>We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be\u00a0directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and removal</emphasis></p><p>We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations.</p><p>We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable\u00a0CCS projects.</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in\u00a0the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground.</p><p>In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning\u00a0global carbon market will be a critical enabler of\u00a0an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a\u00a0diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers\u00a0decarbonise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our transitions plans cover all our businesses</emphasis></p><p>Leading Integrated Gas</p><p>Advantaged Upstream</p><p>Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused decarbonisation pathways</emphasis>We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry.

Our strategy is based\u00a0on\u00a0the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity</emphasis>As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by\u00a02030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensityof our operations.</p><p>Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%,non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to\u00a0reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it\u00a0starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in\u00a02024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p>In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects.</p><p>By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this\u00a0decade.</p><p>Shell is working with shipping companies to\u00a0help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim\u00a0of\u00a0switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in\u00a0the longer term.</p><p>Artificial intelligence for LNG</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by\u00a0around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment.</p><p>Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a\u00a0founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or\u00a0reporting beyond our operations.</p><p>We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future.</p><p>We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor\u00a0the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at\u00a0our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800\u00a0tonnes since\u00a02017.</p><p>[A] Aggregated average performance of Oil and Gas Climate initiative companies.[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in\u00a0our Upstream business</emphasis></p><p>In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects.</p><p>Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf\u00a0of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80%\u00a0over its operating life, compared with its original design. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of\u00a0creating more value with less emissions.</p><p>Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta.</p><p>We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the\u00a0emissions needed to develop the project.</p><p>Reducing routine flaring</p><p>We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target\u00a0is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us\u00a0to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022.</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field\u00a0(Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas\u00a0recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be\u00a0powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity.</p><p>Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in\u00a0the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by\u00a0transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany.</p><p>In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025.</p><p>When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane\u00a0liquefaction plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis>We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our\u00a0customers decarbonise without having to change their cars,\u00a0trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of\u00a0the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of\u00a0the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\u00edzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in\u00a02022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to\u00a0build in Brazil.</p><p>In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns\u00a0and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant\u00a0in the Netherlands.</p><p>The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than\u00a0half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of\u00a0global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in\u00a0Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels.</p><p>Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari</p><p>Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to\u00a0meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis>Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our\u00a0public charging network, currently operates in around 33\u00a0countries.</p><p>We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in\u00a0the\u00a0world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000\u00a0kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year.</p><p>The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has\u00a0a\u00a0utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business.</p><p>In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in\u00a0the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000\u00a0charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400\u00a0additional charge points in development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power positions</emphasis>Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia.</p><p>In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power.</p><p>We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also\u00a0developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and\u00a0Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands.</p><p>In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust\u00a0West.</p><p>We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in\u00a0select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in\u00a0late 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis>We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it\u00a0becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for\u00a0the future.</p><p>To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We\u00a0see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport.</p><p>At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in\u00a0the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of\u00a0our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and\u00a0industry.</p><p>In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up\u00a0to\u00a025 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by\u00a0the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity.</p><p>As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The\u00a0consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</emphasis>Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.</p><p>CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals\u00a0of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS\u00a0lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects.</p><p>By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of\u00a0increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000\u00a0tonnes a year.</p><p>Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2a year. The CO2will be shipped from two of \u00d8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea.</p><p>In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9\u00a0million tonnes of CO2equivalent by the end of 2023. In\u00a0addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the\u00a0world.</p><p>Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2a year. The\u00a0captured CO2will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast.\u00a0This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2emissions\u00a0by around 2% for 15 years from 2026.</p><p>In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in\u00a0the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK.</p><p>Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2a year.</p><p>Direct air capture</p><p>Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the\u00a0decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in\u00a0Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated energy hubs</emphasis></p><p>As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and\u00a0Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into\u00a0our existing facilities.</p><p>We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help\u00a0to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and\u00a0chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will\u00a0be\u00a0powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust\u00a0(noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and\u00a0stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest\u00a0customer, and Aramis, a joint venture.</p><p>As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holland Hydrogen 1</emphasis>Power: Hollandse Kusst (noord) wind farm - 759MW to Data centres and Shell Holland Hydrogen 1 - 200MW</p><p>C02:Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to Aramis CCS- 5 mpta store and Porthos CCS- 2.5 mpta store</p><p>Hydrogen: From Shell holland Hydrogen 1 200MW to Shell</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon credits</emphasis>Carbon credits can make an important contribution to our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. They\u00a0may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon\u00a0benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a\u00a0high quality.</p><p>We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.</p><p>We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the\u00a0market.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by\u00a0Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units.</p><p>Tracking SAF with blockchain</p><p>We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and\u00a0molecules.</p><p>Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with\u00a0Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to\u00a0delivery into aviation fuelling networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology and innovation</emphasis>Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our\u00a0company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49%\u00a0of our total expenditure on research and development, up\u00a0from around 41% in 2022.</p><p>[A] Shell analysis of data published by peer companies (TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron) in annual reports with the note that definitions of R&amp;D vary between companies.</p><p>Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:</p><p>Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.

Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects.</p><p>We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions.</p><p>In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p>We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal.</p><p>In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market.

Our investments in\u00a0producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions</emphasis>Scope 1 and 2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A], [B]</p><p>The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023.

These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our\u00a0Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions</emphasis>Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in\u00a0reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions intensity [A], [D]</emphasis></p><p>Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Routine flaring</emphasis>We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.</p><p>Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of\u00a0five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing net carbon intensity</emphasis>We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of\u00a0the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050.</p><p>The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a\u00a02016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a\u00a0strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our\u00a0integrated power business, including renewable power, in\u00a0places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.</p><p>In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the\u00a0energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our\u00a0previous target of a 20% reduction.</p><p>Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a\u00a045% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The\u00a0chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030.</p><p>The change in our sales\u00a0of these products and services will also\u00a0reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the\u00a0adoption of public policies designed\u00a0to\u00a0encourage the energy transition.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in\u00a0grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)</emphasis>NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p>We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the\u00a0use of our oil products</emphasis></p><p>We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world.</p><p>Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as\u00a0they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..</p><p>[A] Including blending GLT[B] Liquefied natural gas[C] Liquefied petroleum</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris alignment</emphasis></p><p>The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\".</p><p>Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report\u00a0(AR6).</p><p>We start with the complete set of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios [A] and\u00a0then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We\u00a0then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\u00b0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.</p><p>These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5\u00b0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a\u00a0scenario exceeds 1.5\u00b0C before returning.</p><p>We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.

As a result, we are developing a\u00a0multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for\u00a0aviation, that will be created through new technologies.</p><p>At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and\u00a0storage to further reduce emissions.</p><p>In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen.</p><p>While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities.

This will be based on our\u00a0journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:</p><p>Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net basis (2016 baseline); Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025\u00a0[A]; andMaintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and\u00a0achieving near-zero methane emissions by 2030.</p><p>It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030\u00a0and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil\u00a0products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material.</p><p>In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our\u00a0annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to\u00a0build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:</p><p>LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were\u00a0517\u00a0million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023.</p><p>Energy transition and advisory votes</p><p>Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself.</p><p>As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p>Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that\u00a0reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a\u00a0\"significant best efforts basis\".</p><p>We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change.</p><p>It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which\u00a0has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world.</p><p>Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate standards and benchmarks</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition.</emphasis></p><p>They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties\u00a0and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria.</p><p>Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry.

TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark.</p><p>TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a\u00a0company's targets and plans are aligned in the short-term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050).</p><p>In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the\u00a0highest score of four (strategic assessment) for\u00a0the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks\u00a0and\u00a0opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This\u00a0exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90)</p><p>In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\u00b0C benchmark. This is the\u00a0result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate Action 100+</emphasis>Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with\u00a0assets of around $68 trillion.</p><p>Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three\u202fhigh-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures.

The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May\u00a029, 2023.</p><p>We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that\u00a0our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome\u00a0in their assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures</emphasis>Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities.

They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking non-GAAP measures</emphasis>This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort.

The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact.

One of the largest REDD+ projects in Africa and the first to issue third-party-verified REDD+ credits is the Kasigau Corridor, which seeks to protect endangered species, prevent forest degradation and drive direct climate finance to local communities for self-determined, transformative economic development in a fragile region of Kenya. In partnership with local communities, Wildlife Works has co-created new economic opportunities, increased food and water security, and improved access to healthcare and education to relieve deforestation pressure on the project area. The Kasigau Corridor covers over 500,000 acres of dryland forest and generates carbon credits to offset 1m tonnes of CO2 emissions annually for the next 30 years. The Acorn agroforestry platform established by a Dutch financial institution encourages small farmers in a number of African countries to plant trees on their land, to improve soil quality and extract CO2 from the atmosphere. It uses satellite data to measure biomass on participating farms and rewards increases by issuing certified Carbon Removal Units (CRUs) that can be bought by companies, like Microsoft, seeking to offset their emissions. A number of factors are holding back the wider adoption of carbon credit projects across the continent. First, the ecosystem of project developers is very limited in scale and scope: 65+ per cent of project developers in Africa operate only one project and 80 per cent operate in only one country. Second, navigating land rights for NCS projects can be challenging. Third, and partly as a result, it can be expensive to validate and verify individual projects."]}, {"relevance_score": 66, "title": "Understanding the environmental cost of the Ukraine war", "published": "2023-04-26", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Welcome to EURACTIV's Green Brief, our weekly selection of energy and environment news from across Europe.

Scientists say leaders face a crucial challenge: agreeing on a common way forward to safeguard biodiversity by 2030 in order to preserve plant and animal life and help combat climate imbalance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wildlife populations have fallen by 69 percent globally in the past 50 years, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said in an October 2022 report. At the same time, land degradation \u2013 including deforestation, soil erosion and loss of natural areas \u2013 now affects up to 40 percent of the Earth's land and half of humanity, according to the UN. These alarming figures are the backdrop for the COP15 conference on biodiversity that began on December 7 in Montreal with an ambitious objective: to agree a new global framework for safeguarding the natural world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The stakes are crucially high: we are currently living through a biodiversity crisis,\" says Philippe Grandcolas, entomologist and research director at France's National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). \"Biodiversity is essential to human survival. It ensures that we can feed ourselves, have access to drinking water, and it plays a major role in our health. But, above all, biodiversity plays an indispensable role in the stability of the planet.\"</p><p>At present, 70 percent of ecosystems around the world are in a state of degradation, largely due to human activity \u2013 a rate of decline described as \"unprecedented and dangerous\" by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).</p><p>In addition, more than 1 million species are threatened with extinction. Vertebrates, which include mammals, fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians and make up five percent of all animal species, are especially under threat. \"Our previous report found that there had been a 68 percent fall among the total [vertebrate] population [over 50 years],\" says Pierre Cannet, director of advocacy and campaigns at WWFFrance. In 2022 that figure has risen to 69 percent. \"Losing one percent in two years is massive. For species that already have small populations, it could mean extinction.\"</p><p>Climate imbalance: A growing threat </p><p>According to the IPBES, the most significant driving factor of the \"biodiversity crisis\" is change in how land is used and fragmentation of natural space, most often due to agriculture. This is followed by overfishing, hunting and poaching. There is a tie for third place between climate imbalance, pollution and invasive species.</p><p>\"In the majority of cases there are multiple factors at play,\" says Grandcolas. \"But climate imbalance is becoming the most significant threat. The more it escalates, the more it disturbs ecosystems and has an impact on flora and fauna.\"</p><p>There are plenty of examples of this impact. In the past 30 years elephant populations in African forests have fallen by 86 percent. The main causes are poaching and black market trade, causing the death of 20,000 to 30,000 elephants per year, according to the WWF. But repeated cycles of drought and flood are also having an impact on access to fresh water \u2013 a vital resource for the species as each animal consumes around 150 to 200 litres per day. Without it their survival is at risk.</p><p>Similarly, leatherback sea turtles in Suriname have seen their populations fall by 95 percent in 20 years. This is due in part to destruction of their habitat caused by human intervention and illegal fishing. But climate instability is also disrupting their reproduction rates as sea level rise has destroyed and disrupted turtle nesting beaches.</p><p>Mass deaths </p><p>\"Currently there are a few species that are classed having climate change as the reason for their extinction,\" says Camille Parmesan, research director at CNRS and author of the first report of its kind on the links between climate change and biodiversity, produced by IPBES and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021. Yet this is the reason for the demise of the Bramble Cay melomys: \"a species of little rodent that lived on the small islands between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Scientists proved that their disappearance was due to their habitat being submerged [by the sea],\" Parmesan says.</p><p>\"We have also noted the disappearance of 92 amphibian species, killed by the growth of a type of fungus. We have proof that it developed due to climate instability which modified ecosystems and created the right conditions for it to thrive.\"</p><p>The number of species that are officially classed as having died out due to climate instability may be low, but increasing extreme weather events are causing mass deaths among mammals, birds, fish and trees. \"In Australia, we counted 45,000 flying fox deaths [a type of bat] in a single day during a heatwave\", Parmesan says. In France, record summer heat in 2022 caused temperatures in the Mediterranean Sea to rise to levels that killed thousands of fish and shellfish.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Biodiversity: Ocean 'dead zones' are proliferating due to global warming</p><p>Yet, disappearing species is not the only consequence of climate change. \"We can also add behaviour changes, notably migrations induced by climate modifications,\" Parmesan adds. \"Certain species try to move to [new] habitats that are more favourable but this can cause even more disruption in ecosystems.\"</p><p>Biodiverse carbon storage </p><p>Shrinking biodiversity also has multiple consequences on human life. In some parts of the world it can disrupt economies reliant on fishing or hunting and negatively impact the tourism industry.</p><p>\"It's a vicious circle. Biodiversity is a victim of global warming, but it is also one of the major tools to fight against it\", says S\u00e9bastien Barot, researcher at French public research institution Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD).</p><p>From plant life to animal species, individual elements of the natural world all contribute to regulating and supporting the environment as a whole. Bardot says, \"water and earth play a role in filtering pollution, and bumblebees are essential for plant reproduction\".</p><p>But when one element is compromised the rest can suffer too. \"The survival of the planet depends on a fine balance,\" says Grandcolas. \"Imagine a group of frogs suddenly die in a habitat. As insignificant as that may seem, it will have an impact: by disappearing they modify the conditions of the environment. This could allow other species to develop, damage plant life and lead to progressive destruction of the ecosystem, which will then no longer be able to play its role as a climate regulator.\"</p><p>Nowhere is this more evident that with carbon storage. Scientists estimate that the earth and sea currently absorb almost 50 percent of C02 created by human activity. \"Forests, wetlands, mangrove swamps and even deep water are real C02 sinks. When they disappear, emissions are released into the atmosphere,\" Barot says.</p><p>Consequently, \"when we see a forest burn, we are watching a carbon sink disappear\", says Grandcolas. In this way, \"[the presence of] plant life has an obvious impact on the climate.\"</p><p>Two crises, one solution? </p><p>Experts agree on the need to tackle both the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis at the same time. \"We tend to treat them as separate entities, but they go hand in hand,\" says Grandcolas. \"They should be seen as a joint struggle with equal importance. For this to happen, we need to give nature the space it deserves.\"</p><p>Scientists and the WWF have called for more nature-based solutions for both issues. One of the most prominent is increasing protected habitats, which currently make up 17 percent of land and eight percent of ocean globally. \"We need to increase that to 30-50 percent of the planet,\" says Grandcolas. A significant step towards this goal, he adds, would be better global policies for fighting deforestation as preserving forests has the potential to both protect biodiversity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>\"There are also many things to consider in terms of agriculture,\" says Barot. \"We need agriculture systems that are more durable such as developing agroecology and agroforestry. We can improve how cultivated land is managed and limit use of fertilizer \u2026 which would help both biodiversity and the climate.\"</p><p>\"Protection alone is no longer enough; 70 percent of land is now in a degraded state,\" Parmesan adds. \"It is essential to put stronger policies in place for restoring ecosystems. That would enable us to recreate habitats for animals and plants, and the climate benefits would follow.\" For this to be successful a holistic approach is needed. \"There's no point planting trees purely to compensate for carbon emissions,\" Parmesan says. \"It needs to be done with respect for balance in the ecosystem. Big plantations filled with monocultures are not good for biodiversity or for the climate because they are more vulnerable to climate risks.\"</p><p>The three scientists estimate that nature-based solutions could provide around a third of necessary climate mitigation measures even if other steps, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, must come from changes in human behaviour.</p><p>Many such solutions are up for discussion at the COP15 biodiversity conference. Even so, other issues \u2013 namely money \u2013 may dominate. Supported by 22 other countries, Brazil has requested that rich nations provide \"at least $100 billion per year until 2030\" to developing countries in order to finance nature protection initiatives. The request is yet to receive a response.</p><p>This article was adapted from the original in French.</p>", "publisher": "FRANCE 24 (English)", "instances": ["Scientists and the WWF have called for more nature-based solutions for both issues.

For each of these, the group plans to pay 100 CHF ($109) per year to farmers who adopt them and a 100 CHF bonus if all four are implemented.</p><p>The maximum premium, which amounts to 500 CHF per year, will first be paid over two years and then halved in subsequent years.

Presented with great fanfare, it adopts a global and responsible approach and is in line with the efforts made in recent years by the actors in the cocoa chain - chocolate makers, bean buyers and processors, certifiers and governments - to rebalance the relationship in favour of the farmers. Farmers receive only 6% of the $100bn generated each year worldwide by chocolate sales, according to the NGO Public Eye.</p><p>Welcomed by C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana, the Swiss group's project is also supported by several international partners, including the KIT Royal Tropical Institute, the International Cocoa Initiative, the Sustainable Trade Initiative and the NGO Rainforest Alliance. In addition, the proposed system was tested with 1,000 Ivorian farmers in 2020.</p><p>'The opinions and suggestions of farmers and farming cooperatives, as well as ongoing data collection and third-party evaluation, will be used to inform, readjust and improve the programme as it is extended to other communities,' says Nestl\u00e9.</p><p>One sector player praised the 'good foundations' of the project, which 'intends to create a new agricultural model based on the diversification of the producer's income, both in terms of sources of income and crops'. Nestl\u00e9's spokesperson cites another advantage of the project as the fact that mobile payment can be used to pay the premium, which will help guarantee transparency.</p><p>According to him, the financial transaction will be done via an electronic phone transfer from the Nestl\u00e9 supplier's account to the farmers and their wives so that women's empowerment can also be encouraged. This way, 'it is easy to verify and trace all payments from the supplier to the beneficiaries', he says.</p><p>A system that is still too opaque</p><p>However, several actors in the field remain concerned about the system's real impact. Although the Conseil Caf\u00e9-Cacao welcomes any initiative aimed at improving farmers' income, they are waiting to see how it will be implemented. The organisation points out that Nestl\u00e9 does not buy beans directly from cocoa farmers, but instead obtains them from intermediaries, including grinders. This makes tracing the beans and paying premiums more complicated.</p><p>'All the premiums and benefits granted to producers are currently channelled through cooperatives and exporters. However, studies conducted on this system show that it gives rise to significant cost losses, as much as 70%,' says Fran\u00e7ois Ruf, an economist at the Centre de Coop\u00e9ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD) based in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, who works with a team made up of around 10 researchers.</p><p>He believes that only a direct payment to the growers can improve the sector's transparency, as it would put pressure on the cooperatives to clarify their practices. However, this is not the path chosen by Nestl\u00e9, which, by entrusting its suppliers with the task of paying, is taking the risk of maintaining the current opaque practices that external controls find difficult to combat.</p><p>Tracing the origin of the beans remains a challenge. As the demand for chocolate is cyclical and concentrated at the end of the calendar year, cooperatives are forced to supply a large volume of beans over a short period. This means that they often turn to 'pisteurs' (intermediaries who buy the beans at the edge of the field from farmers and resell them to the cooperatives) in order to meet the quotas that buyers have imposed, without any guarantee of the brown gold's origin. Multinationals have been aware of this problem for a long time, but have done nothing to address it.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": [". ).

This non-intermittent source of energy is highly beneficial for a region that suffers from significant electricity supply deficits. Voltalia is a major player in the wood energy sector in French Guiana, with more than 20 megawatts of installed biomass capacity by 2023. In addition to the Kourou plant (1.7 megawatts), which has been in operation for 10 years, the Cacao plant (5.1 megawatts) began operating in December 2020. They will be followed by the future Sinnamary (10.6 megawatts) and Iracoubo (5.1 megawatts) power plants, which are currently being developed. Voltalia's ambition is to meet the objectives of the FrenchGuyana's PPE (Pluriannual Energy Programme), namely the massive integration of renewable energies, including 40 megawatts of installed biomass capacity by 2023, and the region's energy autonomy by 2030 in order to replace conventional thermal power plants that are highly polluting and dependent on fossil fuel imports.</p><p>Biomass technology contributes to a virtuous environmental cycle by producing energy from sawmill waste, land clearing related to other activities (housing, urban, industrial or agricultural development included in the development plan of the Guyana...), recycled wood (end-of-life pallets...) or logging from sustainably managed forests. Their combustion in a boiler makes it possible to control the emission of harmful particles, unlike traditional burning techniques in the open air (more than 99% of fine particles are retained in the filtration systems). At the end of the cycle, the ash produced by the combustion can be applied to fields as a soil amendment improving soil acidity and providing some of the phosphorus requirement, thus replacing chemicals with the same properties. The development of the wood-energy sector has many positive consequences at the regional level, promoting sustainable and integrated growth.</p><p>\u00a0First of all, it helps to structure and economically strengthen the associated sectors of logging and timber industry (income generated by fuelwood which can represent 10 to 20% of the turnover of companies concerned). It also creates local jobs related to the operation of power plants. Other actors benefit from positive side effects, such as the future farmers in the Iracoubo basin who, on the one hand, will supply the local food market and, on the other hand, will earn a stable basic income by cultivating energy crops in agroforestry systems for the Iracoubo power plant.</p><p>Furthermore, biomass encourages innovation in French Guyana. A major example of this dynamic is the deployment of Triton's activity (Triton is a company belonging to Voltalia since end of 2019) to exploit the submerged forest of the Petit-Saut hydroelectric reservoir in order to supply the future Sinnamary power plant. This will be the world's first biomass power plant to receive wood from a submerged forest, exploited with a niche technology. The implementation of Triton's innovative method (SHARC\u00ae) will bring diversification and prospects to FrenchGuyana. It will also be associated with a virtuous biomass supply plan that respects the aquatic fauna of Petit-Saut. Indeed, until now, submerged logs stimulate the dissolution of mercury in water and their degradation in anoxic processes leads to carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Therefore, the extraction of the wood will have a direct positive impact on the lake ecosystem.</p><p>Next on the agenda: First half 2021 results, September 23, 2021 before market</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/f133a7a9-ca8c-4356-97d7-0ef2c7e8a362\">Certification PEFC Kourou Biomass Plant</url></p>", "publisher": "GlobeNewswire - English", "instances": ["Their combustion in a boiler makes it possible to control the emission of harmful particles, unlike traditional burning techniques in the open air (more than 99% of fine particles are retained in the filtration systems).

Other actors benefit from positive side effects, such as the future farmers in the Iracoubo basin who, on the one hand, will supply the local food market and, on the other hand, will earn a stable basic income by cultivating energy crops in agroforestry systems for the Iracoubo power plant. Furthermore, biomass encourages innovation in French Guyana. A major example of this dynamic is the deployment of Triton's activity (Triton is a company belonging to Voltalia since end of 2019) to exploit the submerged forest of the Petit-Saut hydroelectric reservoir in order to supply the future Sinnamary power plant. This will be the world's first biomass power plant to receive wood from a submerged forest, exploited with a niche technology. The implementation of Triton's innovative method (SHARC\u00ae) will bring diversification and prospects to FrenchGuyana. It will also be associated with a virtuous biomass supply plan that respects the aquatic fauna of Petit-Saut."]}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "Commission lists agroecology, animal welfare as core environmental practices", "published": "2021-01-15", "bodyText": "<p>The European Commission has unveiled the first list of environmentally friendly practices that could receive EU funding in the next Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the EU's farming subsidy programme.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 3, "title": "Commission says Germany lags behind in reducing agriculture emissions", "published": "2021-09-27", "bodyText": "<p>The European Commission has highlighted Germany's lack of progress in reducing emissions by implementing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

Beside these Covid-related arrangements, Michelin has signed multi-year agreements with the unions that would offer employees in compatible jobs, and in compliance with local legislation, the opportunity of contractualizing, over time, their working from home either occasionally or on a regular basis.</p><p>In addition to the sales lost to the temporary restrictions on mobility during the year, the Covid-19 crisis had a significantly adverse impact on the Group's business in 2021.Supply chains were disrupted, primarily due to severe constraints in the maritime shipping industry. The robust upturn in global demand, combined with a shortage of cargo space (many shipowners had taken advantage of the 2020 decline in business to start upgrading their fleets) and the closure of certain ports due to Covid-19, caused extensive slowdowns across the supply chain, tightening raw material supplies and crimping the Group's ability to ship from some of its plants.The year was also shaped by labor shortages that impacted the manufacturing operations of both the Group and its suppliers. While government financial support may have temporarily delayed the return to work, it is also possible that, in a more structural way, these hiring difficulties arise from certain Covid-related social changes that have created a new relationship to work.In the face of these severe disruptions, Michelin never ceased operating throughout the year, attesting to the soundness and efficiency of its business continuity procedures, particularly those concerning business interruption risks in the production plants and supply continuity risks.Lastly, the strong rebound in global demand in 2021 spurred a sharp run-up in raw material and energy costs, in addition to the steep increase in supply chain costs. Over the full year, the Group was faced with approximately (EURO)1.2 billion in additional costs, which it successfully offset with productivity gains, assertive pricing management and a higher value product mix.</p><p>These spiraling costs and supply chain disruptions have not undermined Michelin's strategic objectives nor the resources deployed to meet them. Convinced of the validity of its strategic model, the Group has gained in strength during the crisis and reaffirms that its \"All Sustainable\" vision represents the keystone of its future performance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Market Review</emphasis></p><p>Passenger car and Light truck tires</p><p>*Including Turkey</p><p>The global Original Equipment and Replacement Passenger car and Light truck tire market rose by 9% in number of tires sold in 2021, but ended the year 4% lower than in 2019.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Original Equipment</emphasis></p><p>After expanding a strong 28% in the first half due to low comparatives (caused by OEM plant shutdowns in first-half 2020), Original Equipment tire demand was heavily impacted in the second half by the worsening global shortage of semiconductors, which led to a 17% decline for the period.

Based on a weighted average cost of capital of 7.5%, this implies at least a 10.5% annual return on capital employed. In 2021, the Group revised the definition of its ROCE indicator by adding back goodwill, acquired intangible assets and investments in and loans to equity-accounted companies to economic assets. Consolidated ROCE stood at 10.3% in 2021, compared to 6% in 2020 (which is not material due to the disruptions caused by the emergence of Covid-19) and 10.0% in 2019.

The i-MEP is described in more detail in the methodological note in section 4 of the 2020 URD.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Achieve carbon neutrality in manufacturing and energy use by 2050:</emphasis></p><p>The 2021 i-MEP score indicates a sustained reduction in CO2emissions, supported by the robustness of the energy efficiency improvement initiatives that have restored performance to 2019 levels despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis and the inclusion of the third synthetic rubber production plant. In addition, the percentage of renewable energy in the Group's total use rose to 18% from 13% in 2019, reflecting the installation of photovoltaic panels at several plants and the purchase of electricity from certified renewable sources in Brazil and Serbia. The Group's medium-term objectives will be supported by a larger capital expenditure budget averaging (EURO)60 million a year. By 2030, all the technological levers identified in the roadmap will make it possible to meet the objective.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Help achieve carbon neutrality in use</emphasis></p><p>A number of new tires introduced in 2021 deliver significant gains in energy efficiency, such as the MICHELIN E-Primacy and the MICHELIN CrossClimate 2 for Passenger cars and the MICHELIN X Multi Energy D for trucks and the 275/70R22.5 MICHELIN X Incity EV Z for electric buses. The projects now under way have put the roadmap on track to meet the target of a 10% gain in energy efficiency by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Set the global standard for the environmental footprint of manufacturing facilities:</emphasis></p><p>The first year of the Group's new environmental indicator revealed better-than-expected improvements in all five of its components, even as output rose over the period. Water withdrawals, for example, were reduced by 7%, notably by deploying water recycling and reuse solutions at a number of plants across the Group. These results show that the indicator has got off to a good start in meeting the target of a one-third reduction by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ensure that tires are made entirely of sustainable materials:</emphasis></p><p>Michelin's indicator for the year was in line with the roadmap to reach 40% sustainable materials in Group tires by 2030. Due to the nature of the issues addressed, growth in this percentage has not been nor will be linear over the indicator's time frame.In 2021, improvements were delivered on schedule in the maturity of specific technologies in Group R&amp;D projects and in the traceability of certain supply chains with our suppliers. These initiatives did not yet have a material impact on tonnages used in 2021, as measured by the indicator.</p><p>Valuing the cost of negative externalities</p><p>In 2020, as part of its All Sustainable strategy, Michelin began translating its environmental impacts into euros by valuing (i) its CO2emissions from all of Scopes 1 and 2 and part of Scope\u00a03 (upstream and downstream transportation and distribution); (ii) its volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions; and (iii) its water withdrawals. This process is designed to facilitate the representation of environmental issues, enhance transparency and provide a valuation method for use in assessing the performance of Group units or during acquisitions. The levers to reduce these impacts have been clearly identified.</p><p>A reduction from around (EURO)330 million in 2019 to around (EURO)300 million in 2023 was announced at the Capital Markets Day on April 8, 2021.</p><p>In response to the sharp run-up in carbon quota prices on the European market in late 2021, Michelin raised the cost per ton of CO2used to value its emissions to (EURO)100. As a result, the total cost of externalities in 2019 is now valued at (EURO)506 million.

But this time promises to be different. Last year's international headlines caught Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his allies by surprise. We can expect their response to the next fire season to contain more smoke and mirrors. It is crucial to focus on their actions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deforestation is increasing at an alarming pace. It has grown by 94 percent since August 2019, compared with the previous year's rate, which had been the highest in a decade. Unlike drier areas in Australia or California, the rainforest can't catch on fire unless humans cut trees down. The Amazon is being devastated on an industrial scale, and for what? Criminal groups are targeting public lands for low-productivity cattle ranching and mining. Illegal land-grabbing schemes destroy biodiversity and the potentials of bioeconomies, enriching well-connected individuals. Mr. Bolsonaro and his administration encourage it.</p><p>Many in Brazil's elites accepted a Faustian bargain: So long as the government's economic agenda remains friendly, they look the other way. Now, with all eyes on the pandemic crises, the Amazon and its Indigenous groups face existential threats, while criminals act as if they have permission to plunder.</p><p>Oversight and fines for infractions have declined substantially. Last month, Ricardo Salles, the environment minister, fired a director in an enforcement role after he carried out an operation to dismantle illegal mining. The federal government has kept key positions vacant and proposed huge budget cuts to environmental agencies, undermining fire prevention, monitoring and control. The president and his allies support a bill that provides further incentives to deforestation, allowing land grabbers to gain ownership of public lands, including Indigenous territories.</p><p>Earlier this year Mr. Bolsonaro announced an Amazon Council headed by the vice president, composed of military and cabinet members. One of its luminaries, Paulo Guedes, the University of Chicago-trained economy minister, prefers populist tropes to an evidence-based approach. At Davos he claimed that poor people destroy the forest because they have to eat. Deforestation relies on the labor of the poor, but it requires large sums of money and leaves behind desolation and social conflict. There is no evidence that it remedies poverty. Mr. Salles has a history of cozying up to infractors, shunning specialists and trolling environmentalists. In public, he often speaks in platitudes and increasingly pays lip service to environmental concerns. In a recently released video of a cabinet meeting, he encouraged weakening environmental protections while the press is distracted by the pandemic.</p><p>The vice president, Gen. Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, has been particularly sensitive to the perception of foreign investors. Recently, in an online event hosted by a major bank, he promised that troops would be mobilized to combat fires and deforestation in the Amazon. On May 6, a federal decree gave the armed forces jurisdiction over those efforts, a measure with potential to sideline independent experts.</p><p>We cannot settle for photo opportunities. Mr. Mour\u00e3o's Amazon Council does not include representatives from Brazil's world-class scientific community, nor from the Indigenous and civil society organizations engaged in safeguarding the forest. The vice president toes the party line in his support of the legislative proposal known as \"the land-grabbers' bill,\" against the recommendations of specialists, including prosecutors.</p><p>Scientists agree that we are nearing a tipping point in deforestation that will lead to the Amazon's \"savannization.\" This would have dire consequences not only for the forest, but also for Brazil's agriculture, urban water and energy supplies, and global temperatures. The ecological and socio-economic impacts are unfathomable, and they include the threat of zoonotic diseases. There is already evidence connecting the destruction of wetlands and rainforest to drought in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan region, halfway across the continent.</p><p>If we lose the Amazon, it won't be for a lack of alternatives. Brazil has the know-how to turn this around. Marina Silva, the minister of the environment between 2003 and 2008, worked to drastically reduce the rate deforestation, which at the time was even higher.</p><p>International organizations and investors need to use their leverage and pressure counterparts in Brazil. The bill allowing land grabbers to gain legal title, a boon to deforestation, could come up for a vote anytime. Brazil's congressional leaders have been responsive to threats of sanctions, boycotts and divestment. If our current crises do not instill a sense of responsibility and calls to action, then we can expect what feels like a slow-burn apocalypse to get much worse.</p><p>The future of the forest's biodiversity depends on its human diversity. Demarcated Indigenous lands and extractive reserves, where local communities engage in sustainable and often traditional economic activities, have proved to be effective against the illegal destruction of the forest. That is one reason Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies are working so hard to erode Indigenous rights.</p><p>And contrary to what many might think, the forest has sustained complex societies without being destroyed. Millions of people inhabited the Amazonian basin before Europeans arrived. Some archaeologists and ethnobotanists now think of the forest as an engineered landscape, a great garden, resulting from tens of thousands of years of human interactions with fauna and flora. Talking about a return to the \"virgin\" forest never made much sense. Instead, we need to recognize that shamans can be more grounded than C.E.O.s. There is nothing practical-minded about enabling the degradation of ecosystems on which the stability of the planet depends.</p><p>The prescription is straightforward: Allow research institutions and environmental agencies to do their jobs, instead of dismantling them. Only then can discussions about bioeconomies move forward. A number of initiatives already integrate local peoples and knowledge with responsible partners. Cosmetics, ecotourism and agroforestry (from a\u00e7ai to incipient cocoa production), for example, all tend to be more lucrative than cattle ranching.</p><p>The present moment should serve as an alert to the fragility of so much of what we take for granted. No matter what, the Amazon will burn again. But we should avoid at all costs having to find out what it would be like to live in a planet without it. If we maintain course, it is a matter of time.

Deforestation could cause temperatures in the basin to increase by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius by 2050. It reduces rainfall, because trees cycle moisture back into the atmosphere.       </p><p>This combination of higher temperatures, more extreme droughts and the continued use of fires to clear land for farming or cattle is turning the previously fire-resilient forest into a more vulnerable ecosystem. And we are seeing forests burn.       </p><p>As a result, the Amazon may be not far from the tipping point when large portions of the forest turn into tropical savannas.       </p><p>A study that one of us published in the journal Science Advances estimates that if deforestation rates over the entire basin exceed 20 to 25 percent of the forest area, it would lead to an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">irreversible</emphasis> process of savannization. Today roughly 17 percent of the forests have already been clear-cut and deforestation rates have increased since 2015 in most Amazonian countries. In Brazil's Amazon, more than 5,000 square miles of forest (the size of the state of Connecticut) will likely be destroyed this year alone. At this rate, we could hit the tipping point within 20 to 30 years.       </p><p>The effects of this process won't be limited to the basin alone. Warmer temperatures would be spread southward by the hotter air, affecting the large agriculture region south of the Amazon.       </p><p>The moist air that normally flows south out of the Amazon - known as aerial rivers - would be reduced, very likely affecting rainfall in the La Plata river basin in southeastern South America.       </p><p>Savannization of large portions of the Amazon would induce a massive loss of species of plants and animals, and be devastating to Indigenous cultures. Savannization of more than 50 percent of the Amazon would also result in emissions of more than 200 billion tons of carbon and, at the same time, lead to a dramatic reduction in the forest's crucial role as a carbon sink for the planet.       </p><p>Last but not least, the disturbance of this ecological balance could generate a spillover of viruses, bacteria and parasites, posing even higher risks of future pandemics.       </p><p>How can we develop sustainable pathways that would allow us to avoid this tipping point in the Amazon?       </p><p>Amazonian inhabitants can lead the process of making deep socioeconomic transformations, fostering more responsible development and conservation strategies for the region.       </p><p>In the last decades, the policy debate on the development of the Amazon has been dominated by two irreconcilable views. On the one hand, there is a vision for conserving natural areas as Indigenous territories and public lands. On the other, there is a push to develop the land and use its natural resources for agriculture, energy and mining, which causes rapid cycles of degradation.       </p><p>The first model could work from an ecological standpoint, but the region's challenges are now also of an urban nature. More than 30 million people live in the Amazon, a vast majority in cities and towns marked by poverty. These people need livelihoods.       </p><p>There are new initiatives adhering to the principles of an innovative, decentralized bioeconomy rooted in the Amazon, in contrast to treatment of the forest only as a producer of commodities for industries based elsewhere. The region can be a home to humans and biodiversity.       </p><p>That means investing in crops that can be sustainably grown in the forest, like Brazil nuts, cocoa and acai berry, instead of soy and cattle. It also means making sure the profits stay with local people who act as guardians of the forest.       </p><p>Locals are already active in the early stages of processing products extracted from forests and rivers or cultivated in agroforestry or aquaculture systems. In Mato Grosso, for example, Indigenous communities harvest Brazil nuts that they sell for 50 cents a pound to a local cooperative. After being processed and packaged, the same nuts are sold at $4 a pound, while a consumer in a major city is likely to pay around $13 - about 26 times the value of the sale of the raw material.       </p><p>One forest product - the a\u00e7ai berry - has reached global markets and is more profitable than crops like soy or cattle that require destroying the forest. It generates over $1 billion a year to the Amazon economy and has improved the livelihoods of more than 300,000 producers in the region.       </p><p>Yet to change the economic dynamics more significantly, you also need to develop bioindustries in the Amazon - and we now have technologies to create mobile, compact and ecologically sound factories in the rainforest.       </p><p>You might call it Amazon 4.0, harnessing the technologies of the fourth Industrial Revolution. The main objective is to unleash new economic, and inclusive, opportunities for the protection of ecosystems and communities throughout the region, including Indigenous and traditional forest peoples, who are its guardians, as well as urban populations.       </p><p>One of us is working on a project that brings together nongovernmental organizations, investors, public universities and Amabela, the Women's Association of Rural Workers of Belterra, in Par\u00e1, Brazil. The idea is for this group to produce artisanal chocolates using cupua\u00e7u, an Amazonian fruit. They won't just harvest the ingredients, but also process and package them. The group is building a \"biofactory\" in their community, with equipment like three-dimensional food printers, solar cookers and computers.       </p><p>Cheaper solar power and digital communications will make it possible for minifactories like these to operate in remote areas. An app can provide access to global markets, and traceability software that is being developed can ensure that production complies with environmental standards. Locals can be taught how to operate these technologies in just a few weeks.       </p><p>Other \"biofactories\" in the works involve gourmet oils and Brazil nuts, a multimillion-dollar industry. Local harvesters could produce Brazil nut flour, vacuum-sealed roasted nuts and cold-pressed nut oil, for example. There is also potential for mobile genomics labs, with portable genome sequencers, which can be of inestimable value to science and medicine. Forest communities can learn to sequence the genome of plants, animals, and even microorganisms, based on their knowledge of species with particular properties, which they could then register through blockchain systems. A genetic library of microorganisms would be key to tackling pathogens out of the Amazon.       </p><p>We cannot take the rain forest's resilience for granted. We are on path to destroying the Amazon. Turning it into a savanna would get us closer to an uninhabitable Earth. Instead, we can create a standing-forest, flowing-river bioeconomy that fuses scientific and traditional knowledge, preserving biodiversity and improving livelihoods for generations to come.       </p><p>Bruno Carvalho is a professor and co-director of the Harvard Mellon Urban Initiative and the Brazil Studies Program at Harvard University.

Our organic growth was strong, with broad-based market share gains, following disciplined execution, rapid innovation and increased digitalization. We limited the impact of exceptional cost inflation through diligent cost management and responsible pricing. Our robust underlying earnings per share growth shows the resilience of our value creation model. The entire Nestl\u00e9 team demonstrated exemplary perseverance and agility in a challenging environment.</p><p>The evolution of our portfolio continued, focusing on categories with attractive growth opportunities and differentiated offerings. Recent examples include the acquisition of the core brands of The Bountiful Company and the divestiture of the mainstream water brands in North America.</p><p>Our sustainability agenda further progressed as we enhance the well-being of our consumers, help regenerate the environment and strengthen the farming communities in our supply chains.</p><p>We continued to create value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation, steadily increasing dividends and significant share buybacks. Going forward, we are confident in the strength of our value creation model.\"</p><p>Group Results</p><p>* 2020 figures restated following the disclosure of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and Nespresso as standalone segments from 2021 onwards (previously combined and presented in Other businesses).</p><p>Group sales</p><p>Organic growth was 7.5%, with RIG of 5.5%. Pricing increased to 2.0%, reaching 3.1% in the fourth quarter, to offset significant cost inflation.</p><p>Growth was broad-based across most geographies and categories. Organic growth reached 7.2% in developed markets, the highest level in more than a decade, based mostly on RIG with positive pricing. Organic growth in emerging markets was 7.8%, with robust RIG and positive pricing.</p><p>By product category, the largest contributor to organic growth was coffee, fueled by strong momentum for the three main brands Nescaf\u00e9, Nespresso and Starbucks. Sales of Starbucks products grew by 17.1% to reach CHF 3.1 billion, generating over CHF 1 billion of incremental sales compared with 2018. Purina PetCare posted double-digit growth, led by science-based and premium brands Purina Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and Purina ONE, as well as veterinary products. Prepared dishes and cooking aids reported high single-digit growth, based on strong sales developments for Maggi, Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine. Sales in vegetarian and plant-based food grew at a double-digit rate, reaching around CHF 800 million. Nestl\u00e9 Health Science recorded double-digit growth, reflecting strong demand for vitamins, minerals and supplements, as well as healthy-aging products. Dairy saw mid single-digit growth, based on strong demand for premium and fortified milks, coffee creamers and ice cream. Sales in confectionery grew at a high single-digit rate, supported by a strong sales development for KitKat and gifting products. Water posted high single-digit growth, driven by premium brands and a recovery in out-of-home channels. Infant Nutrition reported negative growth, impacted by a sales decline in China and lower birth rates globally. Sales of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) products continued to see robust growth, reaching CHF 1.2 billion.</p><p>By channel, organic growth in retail sales was 6.4%. E-commerce sales grew by 15.1%, reaching 14.3% of total Group sales, with strong momentum in most categories, particularly Purina PetCare, coffee and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science. Organic growth in out-of-home channels reached 24.5%, helped by a low base of comparison due to the pandemic.</p><p>Net divestitures decreased sales by 2.9%, largely related to the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Yinlu and Herta transactions. Divestitures were partially offset by acquisitions, including the core brands of The Bountiful Company and Freshly. The negative impact on sales from foreign exchange moderated to 1.3%. Total reported sales increased by 3.3% to CHF 87.1 billion.</p><p>Underlying Trading Operating Profit</p><p>Underlying trading operating profit increased by 1.4% to CHF 15.1 billion. The underlying trading operating profit margin decreased by 30 basis points to 17.4% in constant currency and on a reported basis, reflecting time delays between cost inflation and pricing actions. The one-off integration costs related to the acquisition of The Bountiful Company's core brands had a negative impact of around 10 basis points.</p><p>Gross margin decreased by 130 basis points to 47.8%, reflecting significant broad-based inflation for commodity, packaging, freight and energy costs. The impact of cost inflation, which increased strongly in the second half, was partly offset by price increases, operating leverage and efficiencies.</p><p>Distribution costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 20 basis points, mainly as a result of the disposal of the Nestl\u00e9 Water brands in North America.</p><p>Marketing and administration expenses decreased as a percentage of sales by 80 basis points, based on strong operating leverage and efficiencies. At the same time, the Group continued to invest for growth and increased its consumer-facing marketing expenses in constant currency.</p><p>Restructuring expenses and net other trading items increased by CHF 2.3 billion to CHF 3.0 billion, largely reflecting impairments related to the Wyeth business. As a result, trading operating profit decreased by 14.6% to CHF 12.2 billion and the trading operating profit margin decreased by 290 basis points on a reported basis to 14.0%.</p><p>Net Financial Expenses and Income Tax</p><p>Net financial expenses were unchanged at CHF 873 million, as a lower cost of debt offset higher average net debt.</p><p>The Group reported tax rate decreased by 330 basis points to 20.9%, mainly as a result of one-off items in 2020, including the divestment of the U.S. ice cream business. The underlying tax rate decreased by 40 basis points to 20.7%, mainly due to the geographic and business mix.</p><p>Reduction of L'Or\u00e9al stake</p><p>On December 15, 2021, Nestl\u00e9 sold 22.26 million of L'Or\u00e9al shares for a total consideration of CHF 9.3 billion. Following the transaction, Nestl\u00e9 owns 20.1% of L'Or\u00e9al and remains fully supportive of the company's value creation strategy.</p><p>Net Profit and Earnings Per Share</p><p>Net profit grew by 38.2% to CHF 16.9 billion. Net profit margin increased by 490 basis points to 19.4%. The gain on the disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares more than offset higher asset impairments and other one-off items.</p><p>Underlying earnings per share increased by 5.8% in constant currency and by 5.1% on a reported basis to CHF 4.42. Sales growth was the main contributor to the increase. Nestl\u00e9's share buyback program contributed 1.3% to the underlying earnings per share increase, net of finance costs. Earnings per share increased by 41.1% to CHF 6.06 on a reported basis.</p><p>Cash Flow</p><p>Cash generated from operations decreased from CHF 17.2 billion to CHF 16.6 billion, mainly due to slightly higher working capital at year-end. In the context of significant supply chain disruptions, the Group increased its inventory levels temporarily. Free cash flow decreased from CHF 10.2 billion to CHF 8.7 billion, mainly due to a temporary increase in capital expenditure to meet strong volume demand, particularly for Purina PetCare and coffee.</p><p>Dividend</p><p>At the Annual General Meeting on April 7, 2022, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of CHF 2.80 per share, an increase of 5 centimes. If approved, this will be the company's 27th consecutive annual dividend increase. The company has maintained or increased its dividend in Swiss francs over the last 62 years. Nestl\u00e9 is committed to maintaining this long-held practice to increase the dividend in Swiss francs every year.</p><p>The last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April 8, 2022. The net dividend will be payable as from April 13, 2022.</p><p>Shareholders entered in the share register with voting rights on March 31, 2022 at 12:00 noon (CEST) will be entitled to exercise their voting rights.</p><p>Share Buyback Programs</p><p>During 2021, the Group repurchased CHF 6.3 billion of Nestl\u00e9 shares.</p><p>On December 30, 2021, Nestl\u00e9 terminated its existing CHF 20 billion share buyback program initiated on January 3, 2020. Between January 3, 2020 and December 30, 2021, the Group repurchased 123.1 million of its shares for a total consideration of CHF 13.1 billion at an average price of CHF 106.08 per share.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 initiated a new share buyback program of up to CHF 20 billion on January 3, 2022. The company expects to buy around CHF 10 billion of shares in the first twelve months. The new share buyback program shall be completed by the end of December 2024.</p><p>Net Debt</p><p>Net debt increased by CHF 1.6 billion to reach CHF 32.9 billion as at December 31, 2021. The dividend payment, share buybacks and the net cash outflow from acquisitions and divestitures more than offset proceeds from the disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares and free cash flow generation.</p><p>Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)</p><p>The Group's ROIC decreased by 250 basis points to 12.2%, as a result of impairments related to the Wyeth business. Excluding Wyeth business impairments, the Group's ROIC was 14.2%.</p><p>Portfolio Management</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 completed acquisitions and divestments with a total value of around CHF 9.9 billion in 2021.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 is transforming its global water business, sharpening its focus on international premium and mineral water brands and healthy hydration products. In March, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of Essentia Water, a premium functional water brand in the U.S., and the sale of its regional spring water brands, purified water business and beverage delivery service in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science continues to focus on building the leading global nutrition and health platform. In July, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of Nuun, a leading company in the fast-growing functional hydration market, and entered into an agreement with Seres Therapeutics to jointly commercialize SER-109, an investigational oral microbiome therapeutic in the U.S. and Canada. In August, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of the core brands of The Bountiful Company for USD 5.75 billion. The Bountiful Company is the number one pure-play company in the highly attractive global nutrition and supplement category.</p><p>Building on the successful global coffee alliance, Nestl\u00e9 continues to expand the reach of Starbucks branded coffee and tea products outside Starbucks retail stores. In July, Nestl\u00e9 and Starbucks announced a new collaboration to bring Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee beverages to select markets across South-East Asia, Oceania and Latin America.</p><p>New Zone structure</p><p>As of January 1, 2022, the company is organized into five Zones: Zone North America, Zone Latin America, Zone Europe, Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa, and Zone Greater China. Nestl\u00e9 will report the sales and growth numbers of the new Zone structure for the first time on April 21, 2022.</p><p>The new structure will strengthen the company's market-led approach and enhance Nestl\u00e9's ability to win in a rapidly changing environment. It also underscores the company's deep commitment to succeeding in all parts of the world, including its two top markets North America and Greater China.</p><p>Zone Americas (AMS)</p><p>8.5% organic growth: 4.8% RIG; 3.7% pricing.North America posted high single-digit organic growth, with robust RIG and positive pricing.Latin America reported double-digit organic growth, with both strong RIG and pricing.The underlying trading operating profit margin increased by 30 basis points to 20.8%, mainly due to the divestment of the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America brands.</p><p>Organic growth was 8.5%, with strong RIG of 4.8%. Pricing increased to 3.7%, reaching 5.2% in the fourth quarter. Net divestitures reduced sales by 6.6%, as the divestment of the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America brands more than offset the acquisitions of Freshly and Essentia Water. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2.5%. Reported sales in Zone AMS decreased by 0.7% to CHF 33.8 billion.</p><p>Zone AMS reported high single-digit organic growth, building on a strong sales development in 2020. Increased pricing, continued innovation, strong momentum in e-commerce and a further recovery of out-of-home channels supported growth. The Zone saw continued broad-based market share gains, led by coffee, pet food, frozen food and ambient culinary.</p><p>North America posted high single-digit growth in the context of continued significant supply chain constraints. Sales in Purina PetCare grew at a double-digit rate, led by Purina Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and Purina ONE. Scienced-based innovations continued to support growth, with new launches including Pro Plan Cardio Care and new varieties of Sensitive Skin &amp; Stomach formula. Nestl\u00e9 Professional and Starbucks out-of-home products saw strong double-digit growth, helped by further recovery in out-of-home channels. Sales in the beverages category, including Starbucks at-home products, Coffee mate and Nescaf\u00e9, grew at a mid single-digit rate. Frozen and chilled food reported mid single-digit growth, supported by strong sales developments for Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine and Hot Pockets. Pizza saw a sales decrease following a high base of comparison in 2020, with a return to positive growth in the fourth quarter. Water reported mid single-digit growth, led by strong growth for the recently acquired Essentia Water business. Sales in confectionery in Canada grew by close to 10%, driven by KitKat. Home-baking products, including Toll House and Carnation, saw a sales decrease following exceptional demand in 2020 but remained above 2019 levels.</p><p>Latin America posted double-digit growth, with broad-based contributions across geographies and product categories. Sales in Mexico grew at a double-digit rate, led by coffee, Purina PetCare and confectionery. Brazil reported double-digit growth, reflecting strong demand for confectionery, particularly KitKat, as well as Purina PetCare and Nescaf\u00e9. Chile also recorded double-digit growth, supported by Purina PetCare, confectionery and ice cream. By product category, Purina PetCare was the largest growth contributor, led by Purina Pro Plan and Dog Chow. Confectionery and coffee also reported strong double-digit growth. Sales in Nestl\u00e9 Professional exceeded 2019 levels, with strong growth across markets.

We will publish an update every three years until 2050. Every year, starting in 2022, we will also seek an\u00a0advisory vote on our progress towards our plans and targets.</p><p>The vote is purely advisory and will not be binding on shareholders. We\u00a0are not asking shareholders to take responsibility for formally approving or\u00a0objecting to Shell's energy transition strategy. That legal\u00a0responsibility lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>While the energy transition brings risks to the company, it also brings opportunities for us to prosper and to build on our positive contribution to\u00a0society. Our strategy, as outlined in this report, is designed to minimise those risks while enhancing our ability to profitably lead as the world transitions to an energy system that is aligned with the goal of the Paris\u00a0Agreement.</p><p>It is important for shareholders to have a clear understanding of the company's strategy as we work together to meet the goal of Paris. The Board and management also believe it is important for all shareholders to\u00a0have a vehicle to express their views on whether our strategy is reasonable in the current environment. This advisory vote is designed to\u00a0be that vehicle. It does not shield or abdicate the Board's or management's legal obligations under the UK Companies Act.</p><p>The support of our shareholders is critical for us to achieve our target to\u00a0become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We hope to gain your support for the approach described in this publication. In addition to\u00a0your vote, we invite your continued feedback ahead of the publication of our next Energy Transition Strategy which will\u00a0be presented to shareholders before the Annual General Meeting in\u00a02024.</p><p>The Board recommends that you vote in favour of resolution 20, in support\u00a0of the energy transition strategy described in this publication.</p><p>CHAD HOLLIDAYChair</p><p>CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S INTRODUCTIONTackling climate change is the biggest challenge the world faces today. Our Powering Progress strategy, which we launched in February 2021, sets out how Shell can and must play a leading role in helping society to meet that challenge.</p><p>As we transform our business, it is more important than ever for our shareholders to understand and support our approach. That is why we are\u00a0publishing details of our energy transition strategy and, for the first time, submitting it to shareholders for an advisory vote at our Annual General Meeting this year.</p><p>Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in\u00a0step with society's progress towards the goal of the Paris Agreement on\u00a0climate change, is at the heart of our energy transition strategy. That\u00a0means continuing to reduce our total absolute emissions to net\u00a0zero\u00a0by 2050.</p><p>We have set our net-zero target, and our short- and medium-term carbon intensity targets, so that they are fully consistent with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. And our targets cover the full range of our emissions, Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of all the energy we sell, not just the energy we produce.</p><p>We are asking our shareholders to vote for an energy transition strategy that is designed to bring our energy products, our services, and our investments in line with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and the global drive to combat climate change. It is a strategy that we believe creates value for our shareholders, our customers and wider society.</p><p>WORKING WITH OUR CUSTOMERSMost of our emissions come from the use of our fuels and the other energy products we sell. So it makes sense to place our customers at the centre of our energy transition strategy. It is where we can make the biggest difference. We will work with our customers to change and grow demand for low-carbon energy products and services, sector by sector, using the strength of our business relationships, knowledge and expertise.</p><p>We will increasingly offer low-carbon products and solutions, such as biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, hydrogen and renewable power, as well as carbon capture and storage and nature-based offsets. In this way, we expect to build low-carbon businesses of significant scale over the coming decade. In addition, we will drive down emissions from our own operations as we continue to provide the oil and gas products our customers need today, while at the same time helping them move to\u00a0a\u00a0low- and zero-carbon future.</p><p>To be clear, the best way for Shell to contribute to the energy transition is to work with our customers to help shape demand for low-carbon energy products and services. In turn, the increasing need to supply low-carbon energy products and services will accelerate Shell's transition to net zero. Ending our activities in oil and gas too early when they are vital to meeting\u00a0today's energy demand would not help our customers, or our\u00a0shareholders.</p><p>SEEKING SHAREHOLDER SUPPORTThe decision to seek an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy follows our continuing engagement with shareholders, including with Climate Action 100+, which represents investors with assets of around $54 trillion. This vote does not replace the responsibilities of our Directors in setting the company's strategy. We have based the structure of this publication around the net-zero disclosure standard developed by Climate\u00a0Action 100+ for the oil and gas industry.</p><p>In the following pages we set out our short-, medium- and long-term targets, our decarbonisation strategy and how we intend to allocate capital across our three business pillars of Growth, Transition and Upstream in the years ahead. We also explain our approach to climate-related policy and advocacy, an important part of how we are working with governments and others to accelerate the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy.</p><p>As the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19, companies also play an important role in powering lives. In this publication, we describe how we will support livelihoods and communities\u00a0as we transform our business.</p><p>We also outline our strong governance and a commitment to transparency. As we continue to implement the recommendations of\u00a0the\u00a0Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we show how\u00a0we\u00a0are managing the risks and opportunities of climate change.</p><p>I would like to thank the investor groups we have worked with as we have\u00a0developed our energy transition strategy, including the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Climate Action 100+. We must continue our dialogue with investors as Shell continues to evolve. We will be transparent so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress to that of other companies.</p><p>This is a critical time in the world's efforts to tackle climate change. It\u00a0is\u00a0also a time of tremendous opportunity for Shell. By transforming our\u00a0business in line with our energy transition strategy, we will contribute to achieving a net-zero emissions energy system, help society reach its\u00a0climate goals and create a compelling investment case for our shareholders, today and in the future. We ask our shareholders to vote for resolution 20 and support the execution of our energy transition strategy.</p><p>BEN VAN BEURDENCEO</p><p>SHELL'S PATH TO NET-ZERO EMISSIONSThis is the first time that Shell has offered investors an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy.

It requires a fundamental transformation of the global economy, and the energy system, so that society stops adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, achieving what is\u00a0known as net-zero emissions.</p><p>That is why Shell has set a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress in achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change. We believe our target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the\u00a0average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>It is aligned with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which concluded that the world must reach net-zero carbon emissions by around 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and\u00a0avoid the\u00a0worst effects of climate change.</p><p>Becoming a net-zero emissions energy business means that we are reducing emissions from our operations, and from the fuels and other energy products such as electricity that we sell to our customers. It also means capturing and storing any remaining emissions using technology or\u00a0balancing them with offsets.</p><p>COLLABORATIONIncreasing numbers of countries and companies have announced targets to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century, and we are starting to see some changes in the demand and supply of energy.</p><p>Achieving the 1.5\u00b0C goal will be challenging but it is technically possible. The extent of global collaboration required will be unprecedented. The pace of change will also be different around the world. The wealthier, more developed countries and regions must move faster. If they do not, then those countries and regions that cannot move so quickly will not have\u00a0the time they need. The European Union (EU), for example, must achieve net-zero emissions by no later than 2050 if the world is to succeed\u00a0in\u00a0limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>Shell has built a scenario looking at what the EU might need to do to decarbonise which gives some insight into the scale of the significant challenge involved. The scenario identified nine areas for action.</p><p>THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGEAs an illustration, achieving net-zero emissions in the EU in the next 30 years could mean:</p><p>ACCELERATING CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>Double the generation of electricity, triple its share of final energyShift the electricity mix to 75% renewables, no coalTarget 10% hydrogen in final energy, including as a fuel for heating, industry and heavy transportTriple the use of biofuels, with a shift to advanced forms</p><p>TARGETING BEHAVIOURAL INCENTIVES</p><p>Invest in infrastructure to improve energy efficiency per unit of GDP by almost 45%Incentivise green consumer and business choices in support of the green economyProgressively raise the government-led carbon price in the EU to more than (EURO)200/tonne of CO2equivalent in 2050</p><p>REMOVING EMISSIONS</p><p>Build at least two major carbon capture and utilisation facilities every month (more than 1 million tonnes each)Reforest at least 220,000 square kilometres in the EU (about half the area of Spain) to remove the remaining 300 million tonnes of CO2in 2050</p><p>Source: Shell Scenarios Sketch: A climate-neutral EU by 2050</p><p>Achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement will require simultaneous growth in supply and demand for low-carbon energy. Crucially, it will also\u00a0require significant changes to the way our customers use energy, whether they are motorists, households or businesses.</p><p>All parts of society including energy producers, consumers and policymakers will need to take action. That is why our strategy is based on working with our customers and others to accelerate the transition of the energy system. This includes supporting government policies that\u00a0will help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>We will build on our strengths, our global scale and deep knowledge of energy markets to help grow demand for low-carbon energy. In this way, we will continue to build a strong business while playing an important role in the transition to low-carbon energy.</p><p>NET ZERO FROM OUR OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTSOur net-zero target includes emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and the life-cycle emissions, including from the end use, from all the energy products we sell, our Scope 3 emissions.</p><p>We will reduce emissions from our own operations, including the production of oil and gas, by increasing energy efficiency and capturing or offsetting any remaining emissions.</p><p>More than 90% of our emissions come from the use of the fuels and other\u00a0energy products we sell, so we must also work with our customers to\u00a0reduce their emissions when that energy is used [B]. That means offering them the low-carbon products and services they need such as\u00a0renewable electricity, biofuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage\u00a0and nature-based offsets.</p><p>Importantly, our target includes emissions not only from the energy we produce and process ourselves, including oil and gas, but also from all the\u00a0energy products that other companies produce and we sell [C]. This\u00a0is\u00a0significant because we sell more than three times the energy we\u00a0produce ourselves.</p><p>In summary, our targets include all emissions from the energy we sell, and the majority of the emissions we include in our targets are not related to our own oil and gas production.</p><p>[B] This includes emissions from the use of energy produced and sold by Shell as well as full life-cycle emissions from energy produced by others and sold by Shell. Combined, these are\u00a0reported under relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2020/\">https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2020/</url>).</emphasis>[C] Sales from retail stations that use the Shell brand but are not operated or supplied by Shell are excluded.</p><p>WE ADDRESS THE EMISSIONS FROM ALL THE ENERGY WE SELL</p><p>OUR TARGETS: SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG TERMWe believe our total absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes and our climate target means we will have to bring that down to absolute net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>As we work to achieve that target, and to measure our progress over the\u00a0next three decades, we have set short-, medium- and long-term targets to\u00a0reduce the carbon intensity [D] of the energy products we sell. Carbon intensity is the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with\u00a0each unit of energy that we sell, and that is used by our customers.</p><p>We use carbon intensity targets to measure our progress because we think they are the clearest way to demonstrate changes to our mix of energy products over time, as we add and then shift to low-carbon energy products and services.</p><p>We have set specific carbon intensity reduction targets for the following years. These targets are compared with 2016 and linked to the\u00a0remuneration of around 16,500 Shell employees:</p><p>2-3% by 2021 3-4% by 2022 6-8% by 2023</p><p>We also have medium- and long-term carbon intensity targets, in step with society:</p><p>20% by 2030 45% by 2035*100% by 2050*</p><p>REDUCING THE CARBON INTENSITY OF ALL ENERGY SOLDgCO2e/MJ</p><p>2016 baseline2023: -6-8% (Carbon intensity incl. mitigation by Shell (Net Carbon Footprint))2030: -20% (Carbon intensity incl. mitigation by Shell (Net Carbon Footprint))2035: -45% (Carbon intensity incl. all mitigation actions (Shell &amp; customers))2050: -100% (Carbon intensity incl. all mitigation actions (Shell &amp; customers))</p><p>We measure our carbon intensity with our Net Carbon Footprint methodology [E] which calculates the carbon intensity of the portfolio of\u00a0energy products sold by Shell expressed as grams of CO2equivalent (gCO2e) per megajoule (MJ) of energy delivered to, and consumed by, our customers.</p><p>*\u00a0\u00a0 These targets include mitigation actions by our customers such as carbon capture and storage and nature-based offsets.[D]Carbon intensity as used in this report refers to net carbon intensity, which includes offsets and is measured by our Net Carbon Footprint methodology.[E] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/ncfmethodologyPetrochemicals\">https://www.shell.com/ncfmethodologyPetrochemicals</url> and other products such as lubricants are not included in our short- and medium-term targets because they are not burnt and do not produce Scope 3 emissions. Their production and processing produce emissions, and we include these within our target to achieve net-zero emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from our operations by 2050.</p><p>ALIGNING OUR TARGETS WITH PARISShell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce our carbon intensity, measured by our Net Carbon Footprint methodology. We believe these targets are aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios used in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR 1.5), most of which show the global energy system reaching net zero between 2040 and 2060.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets with the temperature limit goal of the Paris Agreement. In the absence of a broadly accepted standard, we developed our own approach to demonstrate Paris alignment by setting carbon intensity targets using a pathway derived from the IPCC\u00a0scenarios aligned with the Paris goal.</p><p>We determined our targets using scenarios taken from a database developed for the IPCC SR 1.5 [F]. We filtered out certain outlying IPCC scenarios to ensure that Shell's targets are aligned with earlier action, and low-overshoot scenarios. Overshoot refers to the extent to which a scenario exceeds an emissions budget and subsequently relies on sinks to compensate for the excess emissions.</p><p>We then take the following steps:</p><p>1. The total energy in each of the scenarios is calculated at the point of delivered energy (energy that is processed by refining or liquefaction, for example, but before it is used for electricity generation) using a fossil fuel equivalence approach for electricity. This more accurately reflects the energy delivered by an energy supplier like Shell to the market.</p><p>2. The total net emissions of each scenario are calculated taking into account emissions stored using carbon capture and storage and offset using natural sinks.</p><p>3. The carbon intensity for each scenario is calculated by dividing the net emissions by the total delivered energy. The range of carbon intensities of the scenarios allows for the construction of a benchmark range after removing any outliers.</p><p>By using the benchmark range produced by this approach to set our targets, we aligned them with the necessary reduction in carbon intensity shown in the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. This is illustrated in the graphic on the right that demonstrates how Shell's targets are positioned within the range of 1.5\u00b0C pathways. The upper and lower lines represent the upper and lower boundaries of the benchmark range derived from the IPCC scenarios.</p><p>Until 2035, our calculation of the total net emissions of each scenario includes only the expected mitigation actions by Shell such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting using natural sinks, including any use of offsets included in the carbon-neutral energy products we offer our customers. After that date, we also include mitigation actions taken separately by our customers.</p><p>Today, we do not include any mitigation steps taken separately by our\u00a0customers. That is because the accounting standards to include those actions do not exist. Under existing protocols, energy suppliers report the Scope 3 emissions from the use of their products, which are\u00a0equivalent to the Scope 1 emissions reported by the users of those\u00a0products.</p><p>However, when users of energy mitigate their Scope 1 emissions by use\u00a0of carbon capture and storage or offsets, there is no accounting protocol for reflecting the corresponding reduction in the Scope 3 emissions reporting by the energy supplier.</p><p>To account for reductions in emissions across full energy value chains it is necessary to build on the existing greenhouse gas reporting and accounting protocols to include mitigation actions by both energy suppliers and users. Shell is in discussions with standard-setting bodies such as Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the World Resources Institute and CDP to develop the accounting protocols and frameworks to include mitigation actions by energy suppliers and energy users.</p><p>Reporting and accounting for mitigations in this way will also need new\u00a0systems for the exchange of data between suppliers and users of\u00a0energy. We expect these developments will take three to five years. Our carbon intensity targets for 2035 and 2050 reflect this expected change in accounting approach.</p><p>[F] These scenarios do not include Shell's Sky 1.5 scenario.</p><p>SHELL'S CARBON INTENSITY TARGETSgCO2e/MJ</p><p>OUR APPROACHWe have set our targets to be in line with climate science and in step with society's progress as it works towards the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>This progress will depend on whether governments and businesses, including Shell, provide the right conditions and incentives for low- and zero-carbon choices, and on whether consumers embrace these changes.</p><p>We must work towards our long-term target of net-zero emissions immediately. That is why we have set a series of short-term targets that are\u00a0reflected in the remuneration of 16,500 employees. These short-term targets are not conditional on whether society progresses towards the goal of net-zero emissions; and while extremely challenging, they are aligned with our current operating plans.</p><p>If we moved too far ahead of society, it is likely that we would be making products that our customers are unable or unwilling to buy. That is why we\u00a0wish to work together with customers, governments and across sectors to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions. Shell cannot get to net zero without society also being net zero.</p><p>For example, if we invested in producing sustainable aviation fuel, and made it available on commercial terms at all the airports Shell serves today, the investment would not significantly lower our or society's carbon\u00a0emissions. Most aircraft are not yet certified to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuel and the cost of the fuel is considerably more than\u00a0traditional jet fuel, making it an uncompetitive choice for the airlines.</p><p>Our strategy instead is to work with partners - including aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, major airline users and governments -\u00a0to\u00a0stimulate and accelerate demand for sustainable aviation fuel. As\u00a0demand grows, we will increase our investments.</p><p>WORKING TO MEET OUR TARGETSThe transport sector is a good illustration of how the energy transition is likely to unfold. As in other sectors, the reductions in carbon intensity will be slow at first, reflecting the challenge of switching today's forms of transport to new technologies. The IPCC Special Report shows that the energy intensity of fuels in the transport sector has fallen only slightly in the past 10 years, through the blending of biofuels with traditional fuels, the increased use of liquefied natural gas as a transport fuel, and the growth in electric vehicles. But as the cost of low-carbon vehicles comes down, for\u00a0example, they will replace vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. The IPCC scenarios show the tipping point to be somewhere between now and 2030, leading to net-zero transport after 2050.</p><p>Shell will reduce the carbon intensity of our energy products by working with our customers, sector by sector, to help them navigate the energy transition. As we do so, we intend to build even deeper relationships with\u00a0our customers and meet more of their energy needs. We will start by\u00a0adding more low-carbon products, such as biofuels and electricity, to the\u00a0mix of energy products we sell. Eventually, low-carbon products will replace the higher carbon products that we sell today. This transformation of our business will require a fundamental change to energy-related infrastructure and assets across economies (see box Structural change on\u00a0page 14).</p><p>We are working with partners - including aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, major\u00a0airline users and governments - to stimulate and accelerate demand for sustainable aviation fuel. As demand grows, we will increase our investments.</p><p>For example, in the road freight sector, we are working with transport companies, truck manufacturers and policymakers to identify pathways to decarbonisation. In the near term, we will continue to increase production of low-carbon biofuels. And we will offer biogas and LNG for trucks to customers in Europe, China and the USA. In the longer term, we intend to increase our sales of hydrogen for transport. We are also part of the H2Accelerate consortium, which looks at ways to create infrastructure for generating and supplying clean hydrogen to hydrogen trucks as they become available across Europe.</p><p>CARBON INTENSITY RANGE FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE IPCC 1.5\u00b0C SCENARIOSgCO2e/MJ</p><p>OUR PLANSShell's operating plans, outlooks and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and how we can reasonably expect our business to develop over the next 10 years. Our short-term targets are aligned with our current operating plans.</p><p>However, our operating plans do not yet reflect our long-term 2050 net-zero emissions target, as it is not feasible to make a 30-year detailed operating plan. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions to reflect this movement and continue to be in step with society. This movement will also be reflected over time in our energy transition strategy that we are offering for an advisory vote.</p><p>OUR SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCEShell's carbon intensity in 2020 was 75 gCO2e/MJ, a 4% reduction from the previous year and a 5% reduction from the 2016 reference year. In 2020, one of the major causes of this reduction was lower demand for energy. Demand for oil products experienced the most significant reduction, followed by natural gas and LNG. Another important factor contributing to the reduction of our carbon intensity was the increase in our power sales in absolute terms as well as in their share of the energy mix sold by Shell. The power we sold also had a lower average emissions intensity than in previous years, which further contributed to the overall reduction.</p><p>OUR DECARBONISATION STRATEGYAs a leading energy company, we serve the transport, industry, built environment and power generation sectors. Each has different needs. Some sectors are global while others are highly centralised and local. Some have assets that are designed to last more than 50 years, others less than 10 years. Our deep understanding of these sectors and our customers, and of the opportunities and challenges they face, will help us transform demand for our products.</p><p>Transforming energy demand is the focus of our decarbonisation strategy. To transform demand, we will work sector by sector across the energy system. We will change the mix of energy products we sell to our customers as their needs for energy change.</p><p>This is where we can make the greatest contribution to the energy transition, by increasing sales of low-carbon energy products and services. Today, we sell around 4.6% of final energy consumed in the\u00a0world and produce around 1.4% of total primary energy. Our share of\u00a0energy production may decline over the coming decades, but we intend to grow\u00a0our share of low-carbon energy sales.</p><p>We are restructuring our company so that we can better identify opportunities and the role that we can play in each sector to help transform demand. We are moving from an approach focused on\u00a0types\u00a0of\u00a0products to one where our customer and account management\u00a0is\u00a0focused on sectors.</p><p>We are introducing sector-based businesses accountable for driving the decarbonisation of the sectors they cover such as aviation, commercial road transport, passenger transport, shipping, technology and industry. We will build on our existing relationships across each sector, with consumers, infrastructure owners, other suppliers and policymakers to help to accelerate change.</p><p>TRANSFORMATION OF THE ENERGY SYSTEMThe transformation of the energy system to net-zero emissions will require simultaneous action in three areas - an unprecedented improvement in the efficiency with which energy is used, a sharp reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix and the mitigation of\u00a0residual emissions using technology and natural sinks. While it is difficult to predict the exact combination of actions that will deliver the\u00a0net-zero goal, scenarios help us to understand the direction and pace of the transition needed.</p><p>The diagrams on the next page use data from the International Energy Agency's Sustainable Development Scenario (IEA ETP 2020). They\u00a0show how the energy mix and carbon dioxide emissions could\u00a0change between 2019 and 2050.</p><p>A fundamental shift is needed in the way energy is used and produced. For example, it will require a deep electrification of most energy end-uses and decarbonisation of that electricity. By 2050, most of the residual emissions come from energy use, while in comparison energy supply is far more decarbonised. Low- and zero-carbon energy, including hydrogen and biofuels as well as CCUS, will be needed to\u00a0mitigate most emissions in hard-to-abate sectors, such as parts of\u00a0transport and industry.</p><p>While the Sustainable Development Scenario is a well-below 2\u00b0C scenario reaching net-zero emissions by 2070, it helps to show the\u00a0scale of the transformation of the energy system needed. The\u00a0IEA's Faster Innovation Case, which builds on the Sustainable Development Scenario, demonstrates how the transformation can\u00a0be accelerated to\u00a0achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. For example, compared to the\u00a0Sustainable Development Scenario, it would need a 55% increase in hydrogen use, 25% more energy from electricity and 20% more bio-energy use. The use of CCUS will also need to be 50% higher, reaching 8 gigatonnes a year by 2050.</p><p>GLOBAL ENERGY EMISSIONS: 2019-2050</p><p>STRUCTURAL CHANGEAs well as changes to the supply of energy products, decarbonising the energy system requires structural change in the end use of energy as well. It requires energy users to improve, update or replace equipment so that they can use carbon-based energy more efficiently, or switch to low- and zero-carbon energy. For example, in\u00a0the transport sector, decarbonisation includes replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with electric and hydrogen vehicles.</p><p>In industry, replacing oil- and coal-fired furnaces with electrical furnaces would be one solution, carbon capture and storage is another. And in buildings, replacing gas heating systems with electric heating systems would also contribute to decarbonisation.</p><p>Such structural changes will help to trigger transitions along the supply chain of individual sectors and across sectors, including the production of energy and emissions over time. The International Energy Agency suggests that these changes in the end use of energy will require substantial investment. Of the more than $1.5\u00a0trillion extra annual spending on energy-sector investment which is required under the IEA's Paris-aligned Sustainable Development Scenario, 55% will need to be spent on end use or\u00a0what is more commonly known as demand-side investment.</p><p>RENEWABLE POWEROur sector-based business model reinforces the place of customers at the heart of our strategy. It allows us to work together to identify opportunities for immediate carbon reductions, including low-carbon fuels, as well as for longer-term solutions that will help customers get to net zero. For example, in the Netherlands we have entered into an agreement to provide renewable power to Amazon from an offshore wind farm being constructed off the coast of the Netherlands, enabling Amazon to\u00a0power\u00a0more of its business with clean energy.</p><p>The guaranteed demand from Amazon helps us to invest further in the production of green hydrogen and CCS through the creation of a green energy hub in the port of Rotterdam. Shell aims to produce green hydrogen there using electricity generated by wind power, hydrogen that will be used at the Shell refinery in Pernis to decarbonise the production of fuels.</p><p>Through its air cargo fleet, Amazon also has a growing interest in aviation. Shell has one of the world's most extensive aircraft refuelling networks. We have agreed to supply Amazon with up to six million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel for its cargo aircraft. This biofuel, produced by the company World Energy using agricultural waste fats and\u00a0oils, has lower life-cycle carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel. In December 2020, Shell and Amazon also announced minority investments in ZeroAvia, a company in the USA with ambitions to decarbonise aviation with hydrogen-powered planes.</p><p>OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COMPANIESSTRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH MICROSOFTWe have formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft which includes us working together on digital technologies that help Shell and our customers manage and reduce our carbon footprints. Shell is also supplying Microsoft with low-carbon energy products and services, including renewable energy.</p><p>ROLLS-ROYCERolls-Royce and Shell have collaborated for more than 100 years, pioneering technology, fuels and infrastructure that have shaped commercial aviation. Today, Shell and Rolls-Royce are working together to test Rolls-Royce engines to show they can run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel.</p><p>CLEAN SKIES FOR TOMORROWIn the aviation sector, Shell is a founding partner of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, an initiative with the Mission Possible Platform. This platform was launched by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century from a group of traditionally hard-to-abate industry sectors.</p><p>The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition consists of airlines, airports, fuel providers and engine manufacturers. It is working to reduce emissions from the aviation sector by making sustainable aviation fuel more widely used and available. The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition has jointly developed and published policy proposals which it has put to the European Union to promote debate on how to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality and increase the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels [G].</p><p>[G]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/joint-policy-proposal-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-sustainable-aviation-fuels-in-europe-a-clean-skies-for-tomorrow-publication\">https://www.weforum.org/reports/joint-policy-proposal-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-sustainable-aviation-fuels-in-europe-a-clean-skies-for-tomorrow-publication</url></p><p>SHARING INSIGHTS INTO THE TRANSITIONOur strategy includes participating in coalitions of companies and organisations to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions. We will help to develop paths to low-carbon energy in different sectors, identify opportunities for low-carbon solutions, and advocate government policies and financial market regulations that support the transition.</p><p>In the shipping and road freight sectors, for example, we have partnered with Deloitte to explore paths to reducing emissions [H].</p><p>[H]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-shipping.html;\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-shipping.html;</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-road-freight.html\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-road-freight.html</url></p><p>SIX LEVERS TO HELP DECARBONISE ENERGYAs Shell works with our customers to identify the best paths to decarbonisation, we seek to avoid, reduce and only then mitigateany remaining emissions.</p><p>We have six levers to help Shell and our customers decarbonise energy in\u00a0the short, medium and long term:</p><p>Pursuing operational efficiency in our assets;Shifting to natural gas;Growing our low-carbon power business;Providing low-carbon fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen;Developing carbon capture and storage; andUsing natural sinks.</p><p>ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN OUR OPERATIONSOur production sites are increasingly using lower-carbon energy sources. For example, we are installing eight new cracker furnaces at our Moerdijk petrochemicals complex in the Netherlands, replacing 16 older units. This is expected to reduce the site's energy\u00a0consumption, and to lower greenhouse gas emissions by\u00a0around 10% compared with 2019.</p><p>In the USA, we are building a 250 MW co-generation plant at our Pennsylvania chemicals facility that will also supply electricity\u00a0to local homes. The chemicals plant has been designed\u00a0with an energy-efficient gas cracker that will also use hydrogen as a fuel source.</p><p>As we implement our strategy, we are aiming for milestones which are\u00a0supported by our business plans and planned capital investment.</p><p>EXAMPLES OF ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES BY 2030</p><p>Milestones for 2030 unless otherwise stated. This chart is illustrative of the potential impact across these levers.</p><p>1\u00a0\u00a0 For assets we operate EV charge points include charge points at Shell forecourts and new locations as well as operated charge points owned by customers and third parties.</p><p>INVESTING IN NATUREThe protection and restoration of natural ecosystems could play an important role in limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C, while bringing additional environmental and social benefits, according to the IPCC [I].</p><p>Nature-based solutions, or natural climate solutions, are projects that protect, transform or restore land. In this way, CO2emissions from the natural environment are reduced and more CO2emissions from the atmosphere are absorbed. These projects can lead to the marketing, trading and sale of carbon credits. Each carbon credit represents the avoidance or removal of 1 tonne of CO2.</p><p>The market for nature-based solutions and the number and type of projects which are being developed to meet this market demand is growing rapidly. McKinsey Nature Analytics estimates that there is the potential for nature-based projects to store an additional 6.7 gigatonnes of CO2every year by 2030. Based on current net-zero commitments from more than 700 of the world's largest companies, there have already been commitments of carbon credits of around 0.2 gigatonnes of CO2by 2030 [J].</p><p>The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM), sponsored by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), estimates that the market for carbon credits could be worth more than $50\u00a0billion in 2030 [K].</p><p>[I] IPCC, 2019: Summary for Policymakers.

In line with our approach of avoid, reduce and only then mitigate, we expect to offer our customers nature-based solutions to offset around 120 million tonnes per annum of our Scope 3 emissions by 2030.</p><p>Today, for example, we offer customers carbon-neutral driving using\u00a0nature-based carbon offsets in seven countries. We also offer\u00a0carbon-neutral liquefied natural gas cargoes, which use nature-based carbon credits to offset full life-cycle emissions, including methane.</p><p>BUILDING OUR PORTFOLIOIn 2020, we invested around $90 million in the future development and purchase of nature-based offsets, and we expect to invest around $100 million a year.</p><p>In 2020, we acquired Select Carbon in Australia, which runs more\u00a0than 70 carbon farming projects that span an area of around 10\u00a0million hectares. We are also working with project developers to\u00a0invest in and develop new projects based on reforestation, agroforestry and mangroves.</p><p>In 2030, we expect our own portfolio of nature-based projects to supply most of the credits for our customers. Our trading business will purchase the rest from project developers that we screen to ensure the credits meet the same independently verified high standards. In\u00a02020, we purchased more than 4 million tonnes of credits on behalf of our customers sourced from projects around the world.</p><p>CAPTURING CARBONMost climate scientists are clear that using technology to store carbon plays an important role in the transition of the energy system. The IPCC 1.5\u00b0C scenarios show that even when the energy system reaches net-zero emissions, there will be residual emissions because some sectors and end users will not be able to eliminate the use of hydrocarbons. Some of these residual emissions will need\u00a0to be stored.</p><p>Today, carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities around the world can capture and store around 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CO2. Accelerating the pace of CCS deployment requires continued collaboration between governments, industry and investors, among others, to help unlock financing capacity, accelerate technology development and encourage public support.\u00a0We recognise the scale of the challenge in developing CCS globally as quickly and as widely as needed.</p><p>Today, Shell is involved in seven of the 51 large-scale CCS projects globally, listed in 2019 by the Global CCS Institute. These seven projects store around 5 mtpa of CO2, or around 12.5% of global CCS capacity. By the end of 2020, for example, our Quest CCS project in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 5.5 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating\u00a0in 2015.</p><p>In Norway, Shell, our project partners and the Norwegian government have taken the final investment decision on the Northern Lights CCS project. This transformative project aims to become the first carbon storage facility with capacity to transport and store CO2from industrial facilities in Norway and potentially from across Europe.</p><p>In 2020, Shell invested around $70 million in CCS. This included progressing opportunities and operating costs for CCS assets in which Shell has an interest. We seek to have access to 25 mtpa of CCS capacity by 2035 - equal to 25 CCS facilities the size of our Quest project, or around 20% of the capacity of all CCS projects being studied around the world today.</p><p>STRUCTURING OUR BUSINESS TO MEET DEMANDOur business has three pillars: Growth, Transition and Upstream. Within\u00a0each pillar, we expect the underlying businesses to evolve and\u00a0transform as demand for our products changes, driven through our\u00a0sector-based businesses.</p><p>Our Upstream pillar delivers the cash and returns needed to fund our shareholder distributions and the transformation of our company, and provides vital supplies of oil and natural gas which the world needs today.</p><p>Our Transition pillar comprises Integrated Gas, and our Chemicals and Products business, and it makes the products needed to enable the energy transition. It produces sustainable cash flow and gives us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our Growth business.</p><p>Our Growth pillar includes our service stations, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. It focuses on\u00a0working with our customers to accelerate the transition to net zero and\u00a0is the foundation for the future businesses in Shell.</p><p>In our Upstream pillar:We will focus our portfolio on nine core positions that generate more than 80% of Upstream's cash flow from operations. These core positions will attract around 80% of Upstream's capital spending. They are positions where we have superior capabilities, the potential for growth and access to strong integration with our Integrated Gas and Trading activities.</p><p>The rest of our positions will be run on a leaner operating model. They will\u00a0be tasked with either maximising cash generation or becoming core positions. In some cases, such as onshore Egypt and the Philippines, we will simply divest. We will reduce annual spending on exploration from around $2.2 billion in 2015 to around $1.5 billion between 2021 and 2025. We have attractive exploration opportunities in the first half of\u00a0this\u00a0decade. But after 2025, we do not anticipate entries into new\u00a0frontier\u00a0exploration positions.</p><p>In our Transition pillar:We intend to extend our leadership in LNG volumes and markets, with selective investments in competitive LNG assets to deliver more than 7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of new capacity on-stream by the middle of the decade. We will continue to support customers with their own net-zero ambitions, with offers such as carbon-neutral LNG, which uses\u00a0nature-based carbon credits to offset full life-cycle emissions, including methane. Our petrochemical business will continue to grow and provide products that enhance the efficiency of energy use.</p><p>We intend to reduce the number of refineries from 13 sites today to six\u00a0high-value chemicals and energy parks, and reduce production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030, from around 100 mtpa to 45 mtpa. We\u00a0intend to grow volumes from our chemicals portfolio and increase cash generation from Chemicals by $1-2 billion a year by 2030. We\u00a0will\u00a0produce chemicals from recycled waste, and by 2025 aim\u00a0to\u00a0process\u00a01 million tonnes a year of plastic waste.</p><p>LNG DEMAND TO GROW AS GAS PROVIDES MORE AND CLEANER ENERGYREDUCE CO2AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY</p><p>Natural gas emits between 45% and 55% less GHG than coal when used to generate electricity and less than one-tenth of the air pollutantsMore than 750 million tonnes of CO2savings as a result of coal-to-gas switching over the last decadeIn 2020, for the first time on record, the number of coal-fired power stations decreased</p><p>LNG NEEDED TO CONNECT NATURAL GAS SUPPLY AND DEMAND GROWTHEstimated LNG trade volume in 2040, million tonnes</p><p>In our Growth pillar:Our Marketing business is our single largest customer-facing business. In\u00a02020, Marketing delivered more than $4.5 billion in net earnings and, by 2025, we expect it to generate more than $6 billion. We will achieve this by improving the market-leading position of our lubricants business, and by increasing the number of retail sites and daily customers we serve from\u00a046,000 and 30 million respectively today, to 55,000 and 40 million by 2025. We will also achieve this by growing non-fuel sales at our retail sites and sales of electricity.</p><p>This growing number of customers, made up of large and small businesses as well as individual consumers, will be looking to decarbonise their energy consumption over the coming decades. We intend to provide them\u00a0with the options to do this, from low-carbon solutions such as clean\u00a0electricity, hydrogen and biofuels, to carbon sinks or offsets for\u00a0any\u00a0remaining carbon emissions.</p><p>Shell is increasing the number of electric vehicle charging points globally - for homeowners and businesses and for use on our forecourts - from more than 60,000 today to more than 500,000 by 2025 and to\u00a02.5\u00a0million by 2030. By comparison, that is around 7% of the total number\u00a0of public and private charge points expected in Europe alone\u00a0by\u00a02030, according to research by Bloomberg.</p><p>As the need for biofuels grows, in line with customer demand and policies to reduce transport-related emissions, we expect to extend our leading biofuels production and distribution business, which in 2020 sold 9.5\u00a0billion litres of biofuels. Our joint venture Ra\u00edzen, which produces low-carbon biofuels from sugar cane in Brazil, recently announced the\u00a0acquisition of Biosev. This is set to increase Ra\u00edzen's bioethanol production capacity by 50%, to 3.75 billion litres a year, around 3%\u00a0of\u00a0global production.</p><p>We aim for our power business to sell around 560 terawatt hours of electricity a year by 2030, which is twice as much electricity as we sell today, and for the electricity we sell to have lower carbon intensity than the grid average within the markets where we operate. We are growing\u00a0our power businesses with a focus on Europe, the USA, Australia\u00a0and Asia.</p><p>CLEAN HYDROGEN GLOBAL DEMAND PROJECTIONSMillion tonnes per annum</p><p>Source: Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Economy Outlook (2020), IEA low-carbon hydrogen production data, IEA Sustainable development scenario 2030, Shell analysis</p><p>Building clean hydrogenWe intend to build on Shell's leading position in hydrogen by developing integrated hydrogen hubs initially to serve industry and heavy-duty transport. We will begin by producing and supplying hydrogen for our\u00a0own manufacturing sites, especially refineries. For example, we are developing a hydrogen electrolyser at our refinery in Rheinland, Germany, which produces hydrogen from renewable sources. We will also continue to extend our network of hydrogen retail stations, with an increasing focus on heavy-duty transport.</p><p>The clean hydrogen market is still in the early stages and the volumes are\u00a0still modest [L]. But we see strong potential for growth especially in hard-to-abate sectors of the economy. We aim to achieve a double-digit market share of global clean hydrogen sales by 2030.</p><p>[L] Shell's definition of clean hydrogen includes hydrogen made from renewable sources (usually referred to as green hydrogen) and hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (usually referred to as blue hydrogen).</p><p>RENEWABLES AND ENERGY SOLUTIONS: INTEGRATED POWER STRATEGY FOCUSED ON REGIONAL LEADERSHIPEUROPE</p><p>In top three electric vehicle charging operators by volume</p><p>Energy solutions</p><p>Around 1 million customers of integrated home energy solutions (Shell Energy Retail)More than 80,000 operated electric vehicle charge points (primarily through NewMotion)Intelligent home battery energy storage (60,000 sonnen battery customers worldwide)Sustained growth of the commercial and industrial portfolio with more than 10,000 customers across key markets</p><p>Trading and optimisation</p><p>Growing power trading business across EuropeA leading player in the UK distributed energy market (Limejump)</p><p>Renewable assets</p><p>The Netherlands: 160 MW of renewable generation capacity in operation and 1.6 GW in development across solar and wind*Germany: 10 MW hydrogen electrolyser (RefHyne) expected to start\u00a0production in the summer of 2021Ireland: 300 MW floating wind farm (Emerald) in early-stage development, Shell share 51%</p><p>Shell is increasing the number of electric vehicle charging points globally for homeowners and businesses.</p><p>* Renewable generation capacity figures are gross.

They also allow us\u00a0to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets. This strong financial framework is\u00a0based on sector-leading cash flow, continued capital discipline, capital flexibility and a strong balance sheet.</p><p>THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK THAT SUPPORTS OUR STRATEGYWe look to achieve the right balance between shareholder distributions and investing for the future, laying the foundation for both increased distributions and share price appreciation.</p><p>While our net debt is above the level of $65 billion, we plan to invest $19-22 billion a year across our portfolio. This will sustain our core businesses while funding moderate growth.</p><p>Once we have reduced net debt to $65 billion, we will look to further increase total shareholder distributions. Through progressive dividend and share buybacks, we are targeting total distributions to shareholders of 20-30% of our cash flow from operations. We will also seek to increase capital spending in a disciplined way. With this approach we expect that we will:</p><p>1) Limit our investments in Upstream. Our oil production peaked in 2019\u00a0and we expect that it will gradually decline by 1-2% a year through to\u00a02030.</p><p>2) Maintain our investments in our Transition businesses. We expect to\u00a0see the share of gas rise to 55% of our hydrocarbon production in\u00a02030.</p><p>3) Increase investments in our Growth businesses to build material low-carbon businesses of significant scale by the early 2030s.</p><p>As Shell progresses towards being a net-zero emissions energy business our cash\u00a0flows will increasingly come from our Growth pillar, becoming less exposed to oil and gas prices with a stronger link to broader economic growth. As one of the largest commodity traders in the world, we expect additional opportunities to enhance cash delivery through integration and\u00a0optimisation.</p><p>The characteristics of our Growth pillar mean that levels of capital investment are likely to be a poor proxy for the scale of the transformation of our business. Instead, we believe the best way to measure our progress towards our targets is through the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, and the cash flows delivered by our business pillars. This is because our Growth pillar is likely to be less capital intensive than our\u00a0Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>OUR CARBON FRAMEWORKWe will take the same approach to managing and reducing our emissions as we have done for managing our financial framework, that is by setting constraints, or budgets.</p><p>We will be setting carbon budgets for all our businesses and these will\u00a0help to drive investment decisions which will in turn drive down our\u00a0emissions. In this way, we will decouple our business growth from carbon, transforming what we sell and what we produce.</p><p>By assessing our investments and resources on the basis of our financial performance, and on the carbon intensity of our revenues, we will decide what changes to make to our business portfolio.</p><p>The carbon emissions constraints we place on our businesses will tighten over time, in line with our carbon intensity targets and as demand for low-carbon products increases.</p><p>We are setting carbon budgets for all our businesses and these will help to drive investment decisions which will in turn drive down our emissions.</p><p>TRACK RECORD OF SECTOR-LEADING CFFO$ billion</p><p>Peer range comprises ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Total, CFFO for</p><p>SHELL CORRECTED FOR INTEREST RECEIVED (IN CFFI) AND INTEREST PAID (CFFF).</p><p>FUTURE-PROOFING OUR CASH FLOWS%</p><p>CASH CAPEX EVOLUTION</p><p>CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH THE ENERGY TRANSITIONWe are shifting capital from our Upstream business to our Transition and Growth businesses as the energy transition accelerates and we sell more\u00a0low-carbon energy products.</p><p>We aim to find the right balance between managing our Upstream assets - which will produce the returns needed to help us fund the transition - and investing in our Transition and Growth businesses. These businesses are essential to identify, build and scale up profitable projects that offer\u00a0low-carbon energy solutions for our customers. Our investments in our three business pillars are characterised by several factors including:</p><p>GROWTH:</p><p>Compared with our conventional Upstream assets, investments in\u00a0low- and zero-carbon solutions can require lower amounts of\u00a0capital.The levels of capital investment needed to maintain a renewable energy business are also likely to be lower than in capital-intensive complex engineering projects common in the oil and\u00a0gas industry, with their ongoing need for asset renewal and\u00a0resource replenishment.We can grow our sales of low-carbon energy without necessarily\u00a0investing in producing it ourselves by buying it from third parties and selling it to our customers. This model is part of\u00a0our business today, we sell more than three times the energy we produce ourselves.We can enter into different types of financial arrangements that\u00a0enable renewable generation capacity to be built, without bearing the full capital cost of the project. For example, developing renewable production as part of joint ventures allows\u00a0us to reduce the capital investment needed, while giving us access to valuable expertise from other partners. It also gives us the opportunity to secure a substantial portion of the energy produced, allowing us to grow customer sales (See box Offshore\u00a0wind).Our investments in our Marketing business will help decarbonise the energy system by increasing the provision of charging for electric vehicles and increasing the use of biofuels and low- and\u00a0zero-carbon lubricants.</p><p>TRANSITION:</p><p>Our investments in natural gas can help to decarbonise energy\u00a0use when it replaces energy with a higher carbon intensity such as coal and fuel for shipping.Restructuring our refinery business into energy parks will transform our business away from our traditional oil-based energy products.</p><p>UPSTREAM:</p><p>Most of our investments in our Upstream business are in maintaining assets and sustaining the value of the portfolio.Our existing Upstream assets are critical to delivering near-term cash flow and to enabling moderate growth. Our investments to improve the efficiency of our oil and gas\u00a0facilities can help reduce our operational emissions.</p><p>INVESTING IN OIL AND GASA natural decline in production happens in oil and gas reservoirs at a\u00a0rate of around 5% a year across the oil and gas industry. It takes constant reinvestment to sustain production and extract resources.</p><p>Our planned capital investment of $8 billion in our Upstream business in the near term is well below the investment level required to offset the natural decline in production of our oil and gas reservoirs, and will not sustain current levels of production.</p><p>As a result of this planned level of capital investment, we expect a gradual decline of about 1-2% a year in total oil production through to\u00a02030, including divestments.</p><p>Powering lives by providing energy to homes.</p><p>OFFSHORE WINDShell is part of the Blauwwind Consortium that was awarded the right to develop, construct and operate the Borssele III and IV wind farm off the Dutch coast. Shell entered with a 40% share in 2016 and\u00a0Shell Energy Europe Limited secured a contract to sell 50% of the power produced. We sold half of our joint venture partnership in\u00a02018 when we brought on board an additional partner. The wind farm is now fully operational and has a total installed capacity of 731.5 MW, equivalent to powering 825,000 Dutch households. We\u00a0still sell 50% of the power produced.</p><p>Shell is part of a consortium that has developed a wind farm off the Dutch coast. We\u00a0sell 50% of the power produced.</p><p>CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENTRobust and sustainable government policies will be critical to help the world achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and net-zero emissions by 2050. These must include policies that accelerate the move to low-carbon energy in industries that are hard to\u00a0decarbonise, sector by\u00a0sector.</p><p>Shell's Powering Progress strategy includes working with governments to\u00a0support the policies and regulatory frameworks to accelerate the\u00a0transition to net zero.</p><p>We are seeing a growing number of countries aiming for net-zero emissions and enhancing their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The USA has recently rejoined the Paris Agreement, for example, China has set out its plans to reach net zero by 2060, and the European Union (EU) has committed to climate neutrality, or net-zero emissions, in\u00a02050.</p><p>ENGAGING WITH GOVERNMENTSOur expertise in providing energy can help to shape effective policy, legislation and regulation, and we engage with governments, regulators and policymakers directly and indirectly, including through industry associations. We are also working with other companies, governments and investors through coalitions to identify the policies needed in sectors such as aviation, shipping and road freight to help change demand and\u00a0enable faster decarbonisation.</p><p>We are members of the Mission Possible Partnership sectoral coalitions for\u00a0aviation, shipping, road freight and steel. Each of these coalitions works to help accelerate decarbonisation pathways, including through policy engagement. For example, we are a member of the Clean Skies for\u00a0Tomorrow initiative, which has developed a joint policy proposal for\u00a0a\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel mandate in the EU which would require airlines to\u00a0use an increasing ratio of sustainable aviation fuel.</p><p>Shell is also a member of the Jet Zero Council (JZC) in the UK, a partnership between industry and government. JZC aims to deliver zero-emission transatlantic flight within a generation, and to drive new technologies and\u00a0innovative ways to cut aviation emissions. Shell is also a member of the\u00a0European Round Table for Industry (ERT) which has called on the EU institutions to introduce sectoral roadmaps to net-zero emissions [M].</p><p>GREATER TRANSPARENCYWe aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around political engagement. We set out our approach, including our principles for responsible lobbying, in our statement on corporate political engagement which is published on our website [N].</p><p>Our principles for participation in industry associations govern how we manage our relationships with industry associations on climate-related policy. They build on the Shell General Business Principles and the Shell Code of Conduct, and have been incorporated in the Shell Control Framework, which sets the requirements for how all Shell entities operate. The principles aim to ensure our memberships of industry associations do not undermine our support for the Paris Agreement and that they support the development of government policies that could help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>In 2019, we published our first Industry Associations Climate Review, and\u00a0were one of the first companies to report this information [O]. The\u00a0review\u00a0assessed our climate-related policy alignment with 19\u00a0industry\u00a0associations against our 2019 climate-related policy positions.\u00a0The\u00a0following year we published an update to our review.</p><p>In 2020, we updated Shell's climate-related policy positions and published them on our website [P]. These positions include support for the\u00a0goal of the Paris Agreement and for the development of policies to help the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. They also include support for carbon pricing, carbon capture utilisation and\u00a0storage and\u00a0nature-based offsets.</p><p>In the newly published 2021 Industry Associations Climate Review, we\u00a0have reviewed 36 associations. We plan to publish our next update\u00a0in\u00a02022.</p><p>We will continue to work with governments, other companies, investors, non-governmental organisations, coalitions and industry associations to\u00a0help society achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and net-zero emissions. We will also continue to work towards greater transparency around climate lobbying and reporting.</p><p>[M]<url normalizedValue=\"https://ert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-25-Statement-on-Sectoral-Approaches.pdf\">https://ert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-25-Statement-on-Sectoral-Approaches.pdf</url>[N]<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>[O]2019 Industry Associations Climate Review <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>[P] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/advocacy-and-political-activity.html\">https://www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/advocacy-and-political-activity.html</url></p><p>A JUST TRANSITIONThe energy transition will create employment and opportunities for people to learn new skills. It may also adversely affect workers and communities, for example in areas where traditional products, business activities or jobs are\u00a0phased out.The Paris Agreement refers to the importance of a just transition, recognising that governments must take into account the workers affected by the shift to a low-carbon economy, and create \"decent work and quality jobs\". The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement, has defined decent work as \"jobs that provide adequate incomes and social protection, safe working conditions, respect for rights at work and effective social dialogues\".</p><p>Our Powering Progress strategy seeks to support livelihoods, communities and an inclusive society as we transform our business to meet our target of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with\u00a0society.</p><p>One of the strategy's four main goals is powering lives, which sets out how we support livelihoods and communities. As we transform, we will continue to provide jobs, encourage local businesses to be part of our supply chain, promote entrepreneurship and offer skills training in communities where we operate.</p><p>We are working to help find viable ways to provide low-carbon energy that can support successful local economies. To do this we will work with governments, local communities, customers, employees, employee representative bodies, suppliers and industry groups.</p><p>We seek to work with contractors and suppliers who contribute to sustainable development and are economically, environmentally and socially responsible.</p><p>Our employees and their well-being are critical to the success of our business. During the energy transition, Shell will continue to respect workers' rights in line with the 1998 Declaration of the Fundamental Principles of Rights at Work published by the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO). We will continue to comply with ILO occupational health and safety standards and applicable laws and practices.</p><p>As portfolio changes affect our assets during the energy transition, we\u00a0will\u00a0seek to:</p><p>continue to engage with employees, employee representative bodies and relevant government bodies at a local level, keeping them informed about our plans and listening to any concerns;provide wages and benefits that meet or exceed the national legal standards; andprovide equal opportunity in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and rewards.</p><p>DEVELOPING SKILLS FOR THE FUTUREAs our portfolio changes, we will seek to help employees develop skills for the future. This will strengthen their long-term employment prospects and enable them to seize opportunities created by the energy transition.</p><p>For example, the Pulau Bukom manufacturing site in Singapore will be affected by organisational changes and job reductions as it becomes one\u00a0of our energy and chemicals parks. We aim to significantly reduce Bukom's carbon dioxide emissions as the site produces fewer crude-oil, fuels-based products, instead favouring lower-carbon alternatives that may include biofuels. But over the course of three years, staff numbers will\u00a0go from the current level of around 1,300 to around 800.</p><p>We have partnered with the Singapore Shell Employees' Union to launch a Joint Capability Council (JCC) to help staff acquire new skills that will enable them to succeed in future roles. The JCC will help develop courses for employees in areas such as digital literacy and data analytics.</p><p>The JCC builds upon the UpSkill ShellSG initiative for all staff in Singapore. The UpSkill initiative allows our Singapore staff to access training in a wide range of subjects including digital skills, tech-enabled services, advanced manufacturing, leadership and project management. The initiative was developed in collaboration with local authorities who shared the aim of helping workers acquire skills that will enable them to succeed in the economy of the future.</p><p>SUPPORTING THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE\u00a0DEVELOPMENT GOALSThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to address the\u00a0world's biggest challenges, including ending poverty, improving health\u00a0and education, and tackling climate change. Governments are responsible for implementing approaches that meet the SDGs, but success\u00a0will require unprecedented collaboration and collective action involving businesses and civil society.</p><p>As a leading energy company, we will play our part in supporting the SDGs. Energy plays a critical role in enabling economic and social development and improving people's livelihoods. The supply of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for addressing global challenges, including those related to poverty and inequality. That\u00a0is why we are working to provide energy to those who do not have\u00a0it\u00a0today.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency, in 2019 there were around\u00a0770 million people in the world who lacked access to electricity. Hundreds of millions more are estimated to have an unreliable energy supply. One of our ambitions is that by 2030 we will provide reliable electricity to 100 million people in Africa and Asia who do not yet have it.</p><p>To help achieve this, we are developing market-based programmes that provide access to clean and affordable energy for some of the world's most remote and vulnerable people. We are investing in companies that specialise in solar home systems, mini-grids, and other innovations that improve access to energy. As well as managing our existing portfolio, we\u00a0are also seeking to develop large-scale power projects in key markets\u00a0and to use our global partnerships to improve access to energy.</p><p>POWERING LIVES THROUGH OUR ACTIVITIESManaging the impact of our activities on people living near our operations is essential to being a responsible organisation. Many of our operations are located close to communities, and we work with them to understand their priorities and concerns. In doing this we use international standards as our benchmark, including the International Finance Corporation's Environmental and Social Performance Standards - as well as our own rigorous standards.</p><p>We employ people in more than 70 countries, providing income and benefits such as health care and pensions. Every year, we spend tens of\u00a0billions of dollars on goods and services in the communities where we\u00a0operate. Our activities generate revenues for governments through the\u00a0taxes and royalties we pay and the sales taxes we collect on their behalf. This helps fund health care, education, transport and other essential services.</p><p>We strengthen local economies and employment opportunities through enterprise development programmes such as Shell LiveWIRE. The overall goal of these programmes is to enable communities to participate in and benefit from the stimulation of social and economic development. In 2020, 19,319 people participated in our programmes, which also supported 1,017 businesses. This helped create 1,805 jobs. In 2020, 99 businesses supported by Shell LiveWIRE entered our supply chain.</p><p>CLIMATE GOVERNANCEClimate change and risks resulting from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a significant risk factor for Shell. They are managed in accordance with other significant risks through the Board and\u00a0the Executive Committee.The Board committees play an important role in assisting the Board with regard to governance and oversight of management of climate change risks and opportunities, as described in the Annual Report. The Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) assists the Board in\u00a0reviewing the practices and the performance of the Shell Group of companies, primarily with respect to safety, environment including climate\u00a0change, and sustainability.</p><p>When reviewing these areas and deciding how to advise the Board, SESCo takes into account the Shell General Business Principles, Code of\u00a0Conduct, and HSSE &amp; SP Control Framework. SESCo's duties include reviewing Shell's progress towards meeting our climate targets and the energy transition. SESCo also advises the Remuneration Committee (REMCO) on metrics relating to sustainable development and energy\u00a0transition.</p><p>INCENTIVES AND REMUNERATIONThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the Directors' Remuneration Policy, in alignment with our business strategy.</p><p>Starting in 2021, we are increasing the weight associated with GHG emissions management in the annual scorecard, which helps determine the annual bonus levels for all our employees, including members of the Executive Committee. The GHG emissions intensity metric and its weight (10%) will remain unaltered, but we will add a new metric that measures the execution of GHG-abatement projects with a weight of 5%.</p><p>Performance Share Plan and Long-term Incentive Plan [Q]For 2021 awards made under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the\u00a0weighting of the energy transition condition has doubled from 5% to\u00a010%. For 2021, the weighting of the energy transition condition in the\u00a0Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) will also double from 10% to 20%. The\u00a0target range is\u00a0a 6-8% reduction in net carbon intensity by 2023 against the 2016 baseline NCF of 79 grams of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) equivalent per megajoule.</p><p>The other targets linked to our strategic ambitions will also evolve, with the\u00a0metric connected to commercialising advanced biofuel technology broadening to a measure of growing new cleaner energy product offerings. The targets for the leading energy transition measures are commercially sensitive and will be disclosed retrospectively. The energy transition condition was included again in the 2020 LTIP awards for Executive Directors and Senior Executives and was also incorporated into\u00a0the Performance Share Plan awards made to around 16,500 employees globally.</p><p>\u00a0[Q]Executive Directors and Executive Committee members participate in the LTIP. Around 150 Senior Executives participate in the same plan. The measures and metrics for that plan also apply to 50% of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) awarded to around 16,500 employees.</p><p>TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD)This publication and the description of our\u00a0energy transition strategy are part of\u00a0our continuing work to implement the\u00a0recommendations of the Task Force\u00a0on\u00a0Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).</p><p>We assess our portfolio decisions, including investments and divestments, against the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and the energy transition. These include for example, policy actions such as higher regulatory costs linked to carbon emissions and demand changes which lower demand for oil and gas.</p><p>MANAGING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIESOur approach to assessing and managing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change includes considering different time horizons. The time horizons and their relevance to risks, opportunities and business planning are as follows:</p><p>Short term (up to three years): we develop detailed financial projections and use them to manage performance and expectations on a three-year cycle. Medium term (generally three to 10 years): most of our expected production and earnings in this period come from our existing assets. Long term (generally beyond 10 years): for this period, it is expected that the current Shell portfolio will change and evolve with the energy transition. Decision-making and risk identification on the thematic structure of the future portfolio are guided by the pace of society's progress and the aim of being in step with society as it moves towards the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The overall climate change risk consists of four components, based on the nature of our exposure and the options for our mitigation responses. The four components are regulatory risks, commercial risks, physical risks and societal risks. We provide more details about how we manage these in our Annual Report.</p><p>SCENARIOSOur portfolio and strategy have been assessed against a wide range of\u00a0outlooks. These include the potential impacts of various possible energy\u00a0transition pathways, and changes in societal expectations around\u00a0climate change. Our latest set of Shell scenarios [R] was one of\u00a0the\u00a0many variables used in guiding our updated strategy which we\u00a0announced in February 2021.</p><p>SENSITIVITY TO OIL PRICESWe estimate that a $10 per barrel change in oil prices would have an impact of roughly $6 billion per year on our cash flow from operations. Of\u00a0this, $4 billion would come from Upstream and $2 billion from our Integrated Gas business. Cash flows from our Growth pillar and Chemicals and Products businesses have limited exposure to commodity prices and so are not included in this calculation. This is an indicative estimate and not a prediction.</p><p>Based on this assumption, if the oil price sustainably increased by around $15 per barrel, as it did in January and February 2021, that would be expected to create an additional $9 billion in medium-term cash flow per year from operations from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. Similarly, a $15 fall in the oil price would be expected to result in a $9 billion reduction in cash flow from operations per year in the medium term.</p><p>[R] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/the-energy-transformation-scenarios\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/the-energy-transformation-scenarios</url></p><p>SENSITIVITY TO GOVERNMENT-LED CO2PRICESShell views carbon pricing as a key policy tool for meeting the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement as it helps to increase demand\u00a0for low-carbon energy and creates incentives for investment in\u00a0low-carbon technologies and infrastructure.</p><p>Shell's annual carbon cost exposure is expected to increase over the next decade because of evolving carbon regulations. This expected increase is based on forecasts of Shell's equity share of emissions from operated and non-operated assets, and real-terms carbon cost estimates which range from $5 to $110 per tonne of GHG emissions in 2030. This exposure also takes into account the estimated impact of free allowances as relevant to assets based on their location. The regulatory carbon cost estimate is refreshed on an annual basis as part of the development of our business plan.</p><p>RISK OF STRANDED ASSETSEvery year we test our portfolio under different scenarios, including prolonged low oil prices. In addition, we rank the break-even prices of our assets in the Upstream business to assess their resilience against low oil and gas prices. At December 31, 2020, we estimate that around 75% of\u00a0our current proved oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2030 and\u00a0only around 3% after 2040. We also estimate that around 70% of\u00a0our proved plus probable oil and gas reserves, known as 2P, will be\u00a0produced\u00a0by 2030, and only 5% after 2040.</p><p>EVOLVING REGULATORY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTSDisclosure requirements related to climate-related risks and opportunities are evolving and may result in more stringent disclosure mandates. Several regulatory bodies, including in the EU, the UK and the USA, are exploring frameworks and guidance for increased disclosure and creating uniform criteria for how economic activities score on environmental sustainability. Shell continues to monitor regulatory developments in this area, including progress on the EU Taxonomy and the adoption of the EU Delegated Acts\u00a0for the technical screening criteria and disclosure methodology. We\u00a0will develop responses as appropriate.</p><p>INCREASING TRANSPARENCYWe are implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in our reporting. We are also engaging with others including the investor group Climate Action 100+ and the Science Based Targets initiative as they develop new reporting, accounting and target-setting frameworks for the oil and gas industry. The Science Based Targets initiative is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature.</p><p>The structure of this report outlining our energy transition strategy is based on our continued engagement with Climate Action 100+ and on the net-zero disclosure standard developed by that group for the oil and gas industry.</p><p>The table below shows where to find Shell's disclosures that respond to the recommendations by the TCFD in our 2020 reports, publications and websites.</p><p>OUR STRATEGY TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION TO A NET-ZERO ENERGY BUSINESS<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OUR GOAL:</emphasis>Net zero by 2050, in step with society, aligned with Paris</p><p>OUR CLIMATE TARGETS:</p><p>ALL ENERGY SOLD SCOPES 1, 2 &amp; 3REDUCING NET CARBON INTENSITYABSOLUTE EMISSIONS REDUCTION FROM\u00a01.7\u00a0GTPA TO\u00a0NET ZERO</p><p>ALIGNING OUR BUSINESS WITH PARIS:CHANGING HOW WE WORK</p><p>WHAT WE OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS</p><p>Low- and zero-carbon products and solutions to avoid, reduce and mitigate emissions from energy useIntroducing sector-based businesses accountable for driving decarbonisation</p><p>HOW WE OPERATE</p><p>Reducing Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions to net zero by 2050Operational efficiency: methane intensity target and eliminating routine flaring</p><p>HOW WE INVEST</p><p>Limit investment in Upstream, maintain investment in Transition, increase investment in\u00a0GrowthBuild material low-carbon businesses of significant scale by the early 2030s</p><p>HOW WE MAKE DECISIONS</p><p>Carbon budgets to steer business decisionsCarbon targets tied to staff and executive incentive structuresThe Board and Executive Committee have accountability for energy transition strategy</p><p>IN STEP WITH SOCIETY</p><p>CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS ACROSS SECTORS</p><p>Partner with customers to identify and pilot decarbonisation solutionsParticipate in sectoral coalitions to accelerate decarbonisation pathways</p><p>INDUSTRY PEERS</p><p>Working with Science Based Target initiative, Climate Action 100+ and Transition Pathways Initiative on industry standardsTransition Principles developed with other energy companies</p><p>GOVERNMENTS &amp; POLICYMAKERS</p><p>Responsible lobbyingDisclose climate-related policy positionsIndustry Associations Climate Review</p><p>INVESTORS</p><p>Support consistency in disclosures including\u00a0TCFD and WEF standards Transparency through Annual Report, Sustainability Report and advisory vote on\u00a0energy transition strategy and progress</p><p>POWERING LIVES\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0RESPECTING NATURE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GENERATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE</p><p>DISCLAIMER</p><p>CAUTIONARY NOTEThe companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities.

These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Royal Dutch Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but\u00a0neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.</p><p>This report contains certain following forward-looking Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these\u00a0forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is\u00a0dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of the company, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and\u00a0could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Royal Dutch Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.</p><p>As used in this report, \"Accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the\u00a0Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals.

Key among these methods are agroforestry, reduced cultivation of the soil, and the use of natural nutrients such as fertilizer trees.  </p><p>A study by World Agroforestry Centre scientists, for example, on fertilizer trees that capture nitrogen from the air and transfer it to the soil indicates that their use can reduce the need for commercial nitrogen fertilizers by up to 75 per cent while doubling or tripling crop yields. \"These results should make agroforestry appealing to farmers\" noted Dennis Garrity, Director General of the World Agroforestry Centre and Co-Chair of the Congress Global Organizing Committee.  </p><p>UN Under-Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner said: \"Addressing the range of current and future challenges - from the food, fuel and economic crises to the climate change and natural resource scarcity ones - requires an accelerated transition to a low carbon, resource efficient Green Economy for the 21st century. Farming will be either part of the problem or a big part of the solution. The choice is straight forward: continuing to mine and degrade productive land and the planet's multi-trillion dollar ecosystems or widely adopting creative and climate-friendly management systems of which agroforestry is fast emerging as a key shining example.\"  </p><p>\"If implemented over the next fifty years, agroforestry could result in 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere, about a third of the world's total carbon reduction challenge,\" Dr Garrity said.  </p><p>Researchers suggest that integrating agroforestry in farming systems on a massive scale would create a vital carbon bank. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates no less than a billion hectares of developing country farmland is suitable for conversion to carbon agroforestry projects.  </p><p>\"Nations must seal the deal on a comprehensive and scientifically-credible new climate agreement in Copenhagen - there is a lot at stake, not least the future of agriculture and farmers' livelihoods. One key step will be for nations to agree to a scheme for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) which will pave the way for preserving forests and other key ecosystems, as well as closing the gap in global demand for sustainable timber by shifting production from forest to farm,\" Mr. Steiner stated.  </p><p>According to a UNEP report released in June, the farm sector has the largest readily achievable gains in carbon storage, if best management practices were widely adopted. Up to 6 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent, or up to 2 Gt of carbon, could be sequestered each year by 2030, which is comparable to the current emissions from agriculture. Many of the agricultural practices that store more carbon can be implemented at little or no cost. The majority of this potential - 70 per cent - can be realized in developing countries.  </p><p>While farmers in developing countries are one of the world's largest, most efficient producers of sequestered carbon, to date it has not been possible to calculate or verify how much they are removing from the atmosphere. The World Agroforestry Centre and UNEP are partners in a project that promises to provide the basis for widespread adoption of agroforestry and other sustainable forms of agriculture.  </p><p>The Carbon Benefits Project, launched in May 2009, is developing a standard and reliable method for accurately measuring, monitoring, reporting, and projecting how much carbon each kind of land use is storing. This global project makes use of the latest remote sensing technology and analysis, soil carbon modeling, ground-based measurements, and statistical analysis.  </p><p>Garrity noted that if nations agree to a scheme for REDD in Copenhagen, the work of the Carbon Benefits Project will provide a more credible basis for smallholders to receive payments for conserving forests, practicing conservation agriculture and increasing tree cover on their farms that sequesters carbon.  </p><p>\"Saving carbon is not a priority for smallholder farmers. But, supporting them to expand their agroforestry systems provides income generation and service benefits to farmers that also have the co-benefit of sequestering carbon\" Garrity said. \"For example, by using fertilizer trees and other conservation agriculture techniques, farmers have increased their maize yields from an average of 1 tonne per hectare to 3 or even 4 tonnes per hectare while greatly improving exhausted soils. Food security is enhanced while farmers' production systems become better adapted to climate change.\"  </p><p>Garrity also cited an agroforestry project underway in Malawi, where smallholder farmers are being supported with knowledge about how to plant trees for fertilizer, fruit and fuelwood benefits. The addition of fuelwood and fruit trees on these farms releases women from having to take timber from the forest, and their children are receiving more vitamins and minerals in their diet.  </p><p>The theme of the Congress is Agroforestry - the future of global land use. It will assess opportunities to leverage scientific agroforestry in promoting sustainable land use worldwide. Over 1,000 researchers, practitioners, farmers, and policy makers from all corners of the globe are expected to attend, including Wangari Maathai, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and renowned environmental activist, and M. S. Swaminathan, World Food Prize laureate and \"Father of the Green Revolution in India\".  </p><p>Tree geneticists will explain successful processes for domesticating tree species such as rubber, coffee and indigenous fruits. Economists will present findings of studies on value-adding and improving access to markets.

A study by World Agroforestry Centre scientists, for example, on fertilizer trees that capture nitrogen from the air and transfer it to the soil indicates that their use can reduce the need for commercial nitrogen fertilizers by up to 75 per cent while doubling or tripling crop yields. \"These results should make agroforestry appealing to farmers\" noted Dennis Garrity, Director General of the World Agroforestry Centre and Co-Chair of the Congress Global Organizing Committee. UN Under-Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner said: \"Addressing the range of current and future challenges - from the food, fuel and economic crises to the climate change and natural resource scarcity ones - requires an accelerated transition to a low carbon, resource efficient Green Economy for the 21st century. Farming will be either part of the problem or a big part of the solution. The choice is straight forward: continuing to mine and degrade productive land and the planet's multi-trillion dollar ecosystems or widely adopting creative and climate-friendly management systems of which agroforestry is fast emerging as a key shining example. If implemented over the next fifty years, agroforestry could result in 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere, about a third of the world's total carbon reduction challenge,\" Dr Garrity said.

Up to 6 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent, or up to 2 Gt of carbon, could be sequestered each year by 2030, which is comparable to the current emissions from agriculture. Many of the agricultural practices that store more carbon can be implemented at little or no cost. The majority of this potential - 70 per cent - can be realized in developing countries. While farmers in developing countries are one of the world's largest, most efficient producers of sequestered carbon, to date it has not been possible to calculate or verify how much they are removing from the atmosphere. The World Agroforestry Centre and UNEP are partners in a project that promises to provide the basis for widespread adoption of agroforestry and other sustainable forms of agriculture. The Carbon Benefits Project, launched in May 2009, is developing a standard and reliable method for accurately measuring, monitoring, reporting, and projecting how much carbon each kind of land use is storing. This global project makes use of the latest remote sensing technology and analysis, soil carbon modeling, ground-based measurements, and statistical analysis. Garrity noted that if nations agree to a scheme for REDD in Copenhagen, the work of the Carbon Benefits Project will provide a more credible basis for smallholders to receive payments for conserving forests, practicing conservation agriculture and increasing tree cover on their farms that sequesters carbon. \"Saving carbon is not a priority for smallholder farmers.

The PeruvianAmazon, for example, is home to indigenous communities that rely on forest ecosystem services for their food supply, livelihoods and cultural practices. Recently, conservation groups have been working with local people to develop agricultural and economic resources. <br/><br/> Through better ecosystem management, some 600 families saw their incomes increase, mainly through revenues from more productive fish farms and agroforestry.

They can then use the savings to buy necessary inputs to increase agricultural productivity, such as seeds adapted to changing climatic conditions - an important factor given that a significant increase in food production in the next decades will have to be carried out under conditions of climate change. All this increases their resilience, hence their capacity to adapt to climate change,\" said M\u00fcller. </p><p>IFES are also beneficial to women as they can eliminate the need to leave their crops to go in search of firewood. Women in developing countries can also significantly lower health risks by reducing the use of traditional wood fuel and cooking devices - 1.9 million people worldwide die each year due to exposure to smoke from cooking stoves. </p><p>Benefiting the climate </p><p>Integrating food and energy production can also be an effective approach to mitigating climate change, especially emissions stemming from land use change. By combining food and energy production, IFES reduce the likelihood that land will be converted from food to energy production, since one needs less land to produce food and energy. </p><p>Additionally, implementing IFES often leads to increased land and water productivity, therefore reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing food security. </p><p>Generating more cash </p><p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo an agro-forestry IFES is currently being implemented on a large-scale. The 100 000 hectare Mampu plantation, located about 140 km east of Kinsasha, combines food crops and acacia forests, enabling farmers to grow high yielding cassava and other crops at the same time that they process wood into charcoal. </p><p>Total charcoal production from the plantation currently runs from 8 000 to 12 000 tonnes per year, while farmers produce 10 000 tonnes of cassava, 1 200 tonnes of maize and six tonnes of honey annually. Each farmer, using 1.5 hectare of land generates an income of about $9 000 per year ($750 per month).

In addition to providing them with fuel, the programme has allowed farmers to save money by replacing chemical fertilizers with the compost generated from the production of biogas.

The study, \"Making Integrated Food-Energy Systems (IFES) Work for People and Climate - An Overview\", draws on specific examples from Africa, Asia and Latin America as well as from some developed countries to show how constraints to successfully integrating production of food and energy crops can be overcome. Benefiting smallholders \"Farming systems that combine food and energy crops present numerous benefits to poor rural communities,\" said Alexander M\u00fcller, FAO Assistant Director-General for Natural Resources. \"For example, poor farmers can use leftovers from rice crops to produce bioenergy, or in an agroforestry system can use debris of trees used to grow crops like fruits, coconuts or coffee beans for cooking,\"  he explained, noting that other types of food and energy systems use byproducts from livestock for biogas production. \"With these integrated systems farmers can save money because they don't have to buy costly fossil fuel, nor chemical fertilizer if they use the slurry from biogas production. They can then use the savings to buy necessary inputs to increase agricultural productivity, such as seeds adapted to changing climatic conditions - an important factor given that a significant increase in food production in the next decades will have to be carried out under conditions of climate change. All this increases their resilience, hence their capacity to adapt to climate change,\" said M\u00fcller. IFES are also beneficial to women as they can eliminate the need to leave their crops to go in search of firewood. Women in developing countries can also significantly lower health risks by reducing the use of traditional wood fuel and cooking devices - 1."]}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "Climbers discovering a 'treasure trove' of routes in China", "published": "2016-06-02", "bodyText": "<h>ABSTRACT</h><p>Traditional climbing, along with the more established sport climbing, has gained in popularity as new routes continue to be developed.</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "Garden of Eden amid rubble", "published": "2013-07-01", "bodyText": "<h>ABSTRACT</h><p>The Biospheric Project has found an unlikely home in Salford, an industrial city near Manchester in northwest England, and has made beauty from blight.</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "Bas Eickhout: EU carbon market needs alignment with 2050 goal", "published": "2019-05-23", "bodyText": "<p>The next European Commission will have to reopen the Emissions Trading Scheme directive if it is serious about reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, argues Bas Eickhout, warning the next Commission chief will need to find a broader majority\u00a0in the European Parliament than his predecessor.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 2, "title": "What DNA tests on frozen lasagne can\u2019t reveal", "published": "2013-04-01", "bodyText": "<p>A tiny percentage of the wrong animal passed off as beef in industrially processed food in western Europe?

Pour y parvenir, nous devons mettre en \u0153uvre des programmes efficaces et d\u00e9cisifs afin de transformer les syst\u00e8mes agricoles et alimentaires, l'\u00e9nergie et l'eau. Dans le cadre du programme BIPOSC, nous promouvons un mod\u00e8le complet d'agriculture r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice et d'agroforesterie afin de pr\u00e9server la fertilit\u00e9 des sols et la biodiversit\u00e9, ce qui permet d'optimiser les avantages pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des moyens de subsistance et l'\u00e9conomie des agriculteurs\u00a0\u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Rizki Pandu Permana, directeur national de SNV Indon\u00e9sie.Les principales techniques d'agriculture r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice enseign\u00e9es comprennent l'application d'intrants biologiques, le paillage pour prot\u00e9ger la couche arable, la plantation de cultures de couverture, la lutte int\u00e9gr\u00e9e contre les ravageurs qui r\u00e9duit le besoin de pesticides chimiques et l'application de compost qui r\u00e9duit la quantit\u00e9 d'engrais chimiques n\u00e9cessaires. \u00c0 ce jour, 1\u00a0032 petits exploitants ind\u00e9pendants ont re\u00e7u une formation et mettent en \u0153uvre ces techniques dans leurs exploitations, ce qui repr\u00e9sente une superficie totale de 1\u00a0063,68\u00a0hectares. Le projet a permis de former 25\u00a0animateurs de village pour fournir une assistance pratique aux petits exploitants et sept parcelles de d\u00e9monstration ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es pour servir de zones pilotes et d'installations d'apprentissage pour l'agriculture r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice.\u00ab\u00a0Lorsque j'ai rendu visite aux petits exploitants de palmiers \u00e0 huile il y a quelques ann\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9gion, leur principale pr\u00e9occupation \u00e9tait l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 davantage d'engrais. M\u00eame si les engrais jouent un r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 dans l'augmentation des rendements, il y avait des lacunes notables dans la compr\u00e9hension sur la mani\u00e8re de prot\u00e9ger les sols contre la d\u00e9gradation \u00e0 long terme. Les petits exploitants ont besoin de plus de connaissances sur le maintien de la sant\u00e9 des sols, la pr\u00e9servation de leur structure et d'autres facteurs essentiels. C'est exactement ce que le projet BIPOSC visait \u00e0 faire et nous sommes heureux de voir que les agriculteurs impliqu\u00e9s signalent maintenant non seulement des rendements plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s, mais aussi des sols plus sains sur leurs parcelles\u00a0\u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Bernard Giraud, pr\u00e9sident et cofondateur de Livelihoods.Le projet s'int\u00e9resse \u00e9galement au renforcement des capacit\u00e9s. Outre le compostage domestique, le projet a permis \u00e0 l'association locale d'agriculteurs, APSKS LB, de d\u00e9velopper et de g\u00e9rer une unit\u00e9 de compostage d'une capacit\u00e9 de 100 \u00e0 150\u00a0tonnes par mois. Produisant du compost \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle avec des intrants provenant de moulins voisins et de parcelles agricoles, l'unit\u00e9 offre du compost aux agriculteurs membres \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 des prix habituels du march\u00e9. En 2023, sa premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de fonctionnement, l'unit\u00e9 a produit 588\u00a0tonnes de compost et a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de 421\u00a0millions d'IDR.

Pourtant, dans les ann\u00e9es 1990, le chercheur Claude Bourguignon et sa femme, Lydia, claquaient la porte de l'Inra (Institut national de la recherche agronomique, NDLR). Ils parlaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 de biologie des sols mais ils n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e9cout\u00e9s.

Des sc\u00e9nographies baptis\u00e9es Solivivi ou Parenth\u00e8ses (Re) Naissantes, notamment avec leurs troncs dispos\u00e9s sur le sol, illustrent bien cette id\u00e9e de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration des sols, note Chantal Colleu-Dumond, la directrice du domaine. Ils sont ici depuis avril dernier et on voit \u00e0 quel point ils se sont d\u00e9grad\u00e9s permettant le d\u00e9veloppement de la vie sous terre. C'est le propre de notre festival d'inviter le grand public \u00e0 se poser les bonnes questions.\u00bbD'autres pionniers tentent de convaincre le plus grand nombre. Comme Konrad Schreiber, un ancien \u00e9leveur ayant fond\u00e9 Ver de terre Production. Lors de ses formations, il vulgarise \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame le principe des sols vivants, les secrets de la vie sous terre pouvant faire ressurgir de mauvais souvenirs de cours de SVT, tant ils s'av\u00e8rent complexes. \u00abPour qu'un sol regorge de biodiversit\u00e9, il faut avoir une maison en bon \u00e9tat, qui propose le g\u00eete et le couvert, c'est-\u00e0-dire de la nourriture permettant aux \u00eatres vivants de se reproduire, expliquait Konrad Schreiber au Figaro en 2023. Si l'on bine, on d\u00e9truit son toit, si l'on b\u00eache, on endommage ses fondations. Conclusion: pour avoir un sol vivant, on ne travaille plus la terre, on apporte de la nourriture \u00e0 ses habitants - vers de terre, champignons, insectes, bact\u00e9ries. C'est-\u00e0-dire de la mati\u00e8re organique.\u00bbL'id\u00e9e fait son chemin, animant les d\u00eeners en ville. Des bobos parisiens se vantent de laisser au sol les troncs de leurs arbres morts, ne craignant plus d'ab\u00eemer la belle pelouse de leur maison de campagne. Thierry Audibert fait partie de ces Fran\u00e7ais convaincus. Depuis une dizaine d'ann\u00e9es il a adopt\u00e9 les \u00abbons gestes\u00bb dans les 2000 m2 de son jardin \u00e0 Saint-Leu-la-For\u00eat (Val-d'Oise). \u00abAvec ma femme, nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 notre propre composteur qui sert \u00e0 nourrir la terre. Avec le temps, nous avons compris que le compost \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 lorsqu'il sentait l'humus, le champignon... Nous avons beaucoup appris en lisant les ouvrages de Marc- Andr\u00e9 Selosse et en assistant aux conf\u00e9rences organis\u00e9es par Pierre Alexandre dans sa p\u00e9pini\u00e8re voisine.\u00bb Pour ce jardinier amateur, ces pratiques d\u00e9passent maintenant le cadre d'une mode mais se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent plus durables. \u00abCe ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur, remarque de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 Gaspard Koenig. Si c'est chic de faire tout \u00e7a, tant mieux. Cela montre qu'il y a une vraie aspiration sociale. C'est le reflet d'une vraie transformation. Mais le coeur du sujet ce sont les agriculteurs, les coop\u00e9ratives c\u00e9r\u00e9ali\u00e8res qu'il faut convaincre qu'un jour ou l'autre ils devront r\u00e9duire leurs intrants.

Nous avons fait de notre mieux. Mais \u00e0 long terme cela est devenu probl\u00e9matique.

Ce qui entra\u00eene la perte des r\u00e9serves d'eau et favorise l'\u00e9rosion. Ainsi, dans certaines r\u00e9gions m\u00e9diterran\u00e9ennes, les sols pauvres sont le r\u00e9sultat de 5000ans de labours\u00bb.

Il s'agit d'encourager le d\u00e9veloppement des mati\u00e8res vivantes dans le sol. Et quand cela patine, nous arrivons avec nos b\u00e9quilles agro\u00e9cologiques. Si nous changeons la gestion des terres avec l'agro\u00e9cologie, en 2 \u00e0 10ans nous pouvons r\u00e9duire l'\u00e9rosion, am\u00e9liorer le stockage de l'eau et la qualit\u00e9 de l'eau, augmenter la fertilit\u00e9 intrins\u00e8que.\u00bb\u00abAujourd'hui, le grand d\u00e9fi est de trouver des solutions qui conviennent \u00e0 la fois aux financiers et aux agriculteurs\u00bb, souligne Anne Trombini, directrice de l'association Pour une agriculture du vivant. \u00abPourquoi n'a-t-on pas encore fait la transition \u00e9cologique? Car le monde agricole n'a pas voix au chapitre sur les d\u00e9cisions qui le concernent. Les enjeux agricoles sont tir\u00e9s, d'une part, par le secteur agroalimentaire qui d\u00e9veloppe les fili\u00e8res dont il a besoin et les impose au monde agricole, et d'autre part par les acteurs financiers qui soutiennent le monde agroalimentaire. Les m\u00e9thodes sont impos\u00e9es par l'industrie agroalimentaire mais leur traduction reste difficile par l'agriculteur dans son champ.\u00bbIl s'agit aussi de prendre en compte le secteur public qui va donner \u00e0 l'agriculteur des orientations diff\u00e9rentes, voire contradictoires, de celles du secteur priv\u00e9. \u00abPour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me, il faut construire un sch\u00e9ma de financement collectif de la transition en articulant les diff\u00e9rents dispositifs\u00bb, pr\u00e9cise Anne Trombini. Aujourd'hui, trois agriculteurs sur quatre per\u00e7oivent les effets du changement climatique. \u00abEt 70% d'entre eux savent que les sols sont des leviers pour pallier les effets de celui-ci. Pour trouver des solutions \u00e0 la transition agro\u00e9cologique, il faut une approche scientifique, \u00eatre pragmatique, prendre en compte les enjeux \u00e9conomiques. Et aller vite.\u00bbIl s'agit aussi d'expliquer au grand public, et notamment aux plus jeunes, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des sols vivants. De grands m\u00e9dias s'y int\u00e9ressent, comme Disney, qui pr\u00e9pare une s\u00e9rie tourn\u00e9e dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Benedikt B\u00f6sel, ex-banquier d'affaires allemand qui a repris la ferme de ses parents dans le Brandebourg, devenant ainsi un porte-parole de l'agriculture r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative.

Regierungen wie auch der Privatsektor k\u00f6nnen durch Investitionen in naturbezogene L\u00f6sungen in gro\u00dfem Ma\u00dfstab sowohl CO2-Emissionen reduzieren als auch Kohlenstoff aus der Atmosph\u00e4re entfernen. Der Agroforestry and Restoration Accelerator ist ein solches CO2-Abbauprojekt und Teil von Amazons Verpflichtung zur Erf\u00fcllung von The Climate Pledge, eine Initiative, die das Unternehmen gemeinsam mit Global Optimism ins Leben gerufen hat. Die Unterzeichner des Klimaversprechens verpflichten sich, bis 2040 - 10 Jahre vor dem \u00dcbereinkommen von Paris - eine CO2-neutrale Produktion zu erreichen. Im Rahmen der Verpflichtung zur Erf\u00fcllung des Klimaversprechens setzt Amazon in erster Linie seine Innovationen fort und investiert in die Dekarbonisierung seiner Gesch\u00e4ftsbereiche. Das Unternehmen hat 100.000 elektrische Lieferfahrzeuge erworben und ist der gr\u00f6\u00dfte gewerbliche Abnehmer von erneuerbaren Energien in der Welt. Amazon investiert dar\u00fcber hinaus in naturbezogene L\u00f6sungen au\u00dferhalb seiner Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette durch den Right Now Climate Fund, der den Accelerator und andere Projekte zur Wiederbelebung gesch\u00e4digter B\u00f6den auf eine Art und Weise unterst\u00fctzt, die die Lebensgrundlage der lokalen Gemeinschaften verbessert und CO2 aus der Atmosph\u00e4re entfernt. Dar\u00fcber hinaus arbeiten Amazon und andere Partner im Rahmen der k\u00fcrzlich angek\u00fcndigten LEAF Coalition - einer \u00f6ffentlich-privaten Initiative, die mindestens 1 Milliarde USD f\u00fcr den Schutz der weltweiten Tropenw\u00e4lder mobilisieren soll - daran, die Abholzung der Tropenw\u00e4lder einzud\u00e4mmen und so den CO2-Aussto\u00df in die Atmosph\u00e4re zu verringern. ,,Die Wiederherstellung der W\u00e4lder der Welt ist eine der sinnvollsten Ma\u00dfnahmen, die wir jetzt ergreifen k\u00f6nnen, um den Klimawandel zu bek\u00e4mpfen, und sie erfordert innovative L\u00f6sungen, um erfolgreich zu sein\", sagte Kara Hurst, Vice President des Bereichs Worldwide Sustainability bei Amazon. ,,Wir sind stolz darauf, den Agroforestry and Restoration Accelerator in Zusammenarbeit mit The Nature Conservancy ins Leben zu rufen, um L\u00f6sungen zu f\u00f6rdern, die eine hohe \u00f6kologische Integrit\u00e4t und einen starken Nutzen f\u00fcr die Gemeinschaft in den Vordergrund stellen.

Ein gro\u00dfes Lob an Amazon und The Nature Conservancy.\" Die Anfangsinvestition von Amazon in den Accelerator wird 3.000 Landwirte f\u00f6rdern und innerhalb von drei Jahren etwa 20.000 Hektar wiederherstellen - eine Landmasse, die in etwa der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Stadt Seattle entspricht - und bis 2050 bis zu 10 Millionen Tonnen Kohlendioxid aus der Atmosph\u00e4re entfernen. The Nature Conservancy wird mit dem World Agroforestry Centre und mehreren lokalen zivilen Organisationen zusammenarbeiten, um den Accelerator umzusetzen. Dabei werden Kleinbauern bei der Umwandlung gesch\u00e4digter Viehweiden in einheimischen Wald und Agroforstwirtschaft unterst\u00fctzt. Die Agroforstsysteme werden den Landwirten \u00fcber den Verkauf von Kakao und anderen Nutzpflanzen eine nachhaltige Einkommensquelle bieten. Im Rahmen des Accelerators werden dar\u00fcber hinaus innovative Wege zur Unterst\u00fctzung der Landwirte und zur F\u00f6rderung der M\u00e4rkte f\u00fcr nachhaltige forstwirtschaftliche Erzeugnisse getestet, auch mit Hilfe digitaler Technologien, und es werden neue Methoden und satellitengest\u00fctzte Technologien zur Quantifizierung und \u00dcberwachung des CO2-Abbaus entwickelt. ,,Par\u00e1 ist Heimat von 9 Prozent des weltweiten Tropenwaldes. Doch diese Region sieht sich mit einer beispiellosen Abholzung konfrontiert und hat im letzten Jahr jeden Tag 3.300 Hektar Wald verloren\", sagte Jennifer Morris, CEO von The Nature Conservancy. ,,In den letzten 13 Jahren waren kleine Farmen in Par\u00e1 - einem Gebiet, in dem Brandrodung die einzige Option zu sein scheint - f\u00fcr durchschnittlich 40 % der Entwaldung im Bundesstaat verantwortlich. Seit 20 Jahren arbeitet The Nature Conservancy mit Kleinbauern, Gemeindevertretern, Regierungsbeamten und indigenen V\u00f6lkern zusammen, um L\u00f6sungen zu finden und umzusetzen, die f\u00fcr beide Seiten von Vorteil sind, wie z. B. die Agroforstwirtschaft, die den Menschen und der Natur zu Wohlstand verhilft. Diese neue Partnerschaft mitAmazon erm\u00f6glicht es uns, die Ressourcen und die technische Unterst\u00fctzung bereitzustellen, die n\u00f6tig sind, um dieses Programm voranzubringen und zu zeigen, dass regenerative Agroforstwirtschaft und CO2-M\u00e4rkte tragf\u00e4hige Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle f\u00fcr die Gemeinden im Amazonasgebiet sind.\" ,,Wir m\u00fcssen unsere Kr\u00e4fte vereinen, um das Jahrhundertziel zu erreichen: unsere Wirtschaft weiterzuentwickeln und das Einkommen der Menschen zu sichern und gleichzeitig den Wald zu erhalten und wiederherzustellen\", sagte Helder Barbalho, Gouverneur von Par\u00e1. ,,Der Bundesstaat Par\u00e1 ist bereit, sich dieser Herausforderung zu stellen, und unsere Strategie ist in unserem Amazonia Agora-Plan klar festgelegt. Darin verpflichten wir uns, bis 2036 durch die Reduzierung der Abholzung und die F\u00f6rderung der Wiederaufforstung kohlendioxidfrei zu werden. Investitionen wie die von Amazon in nachhaltige Agroforstwirtschaft und Wiederaufforstung in Par\u00e1 sind sehr begr\u00fc\u00dfenswert.

The increasingly global chain of interdependence must be aligned with the general process of urbanisation, which will encompass 80 % of the world's population within the next few decades. This process creates continuous urban fabrics extending over hundreds of kilometres, amplifying the urban problems that we are familiar with : haphazard urbanisation of the outskirts of major Southern cities, inadequate public transport, diminishing availability of land and housing, absence or instability of basic services, mass-poverty leading to urban violence, insecure employment, and increasing socio-spatial segregation. Moreover, widespread urbanisation has resulted in a human desertification of the countryside as well as farming and livestock breeding that is extensively industrialised, thus leading to harmful consequences. How then can a rural world, which is extremely narrow demographically and driven mainly by industrialised agriculture and breeding, healthily nourish a huge urban fabric ?</p><p>Massive industrialized agriculture produces food of low nutritional quality and taste, a carrier of dangerous chemical residues from pesticides and antibiotics used for growing millions of hectares of cereals, or raising millions of poultry, cattle and pigs.

In a context of widespread disengagement by the public authorities, especially in Southern countries, we are witnessing the ubiquitous growth of local players (local authorities, NGO's, associations, and various popular initiatives that spring up here and there in these countries).

Any significant advance in terms of development will not be fully achieved without the integration, progressive and resolute, of those left behind by economic growth, who represent today one of the principal components of the urban and rural worlds. Urban policy cannot be conceived in isolation or divorced from rural policy.</p><p>We have too few organisations to fight against the forms of consumer intoxication by addictive behaviour, manipulated as we are by the psychologies of marketing and hype. We need a policy of civilization that will reform the chain of consumption running from industrial production to the subjugation of individuals, by way of the financial economy, speculation and abusive and illusory advertising. Education and public-spirited behaviour are essential here.</p><p>Ultimately, it is we, the citizen-consumers, who can regulate the system by boycotting harmful products and choosing those of good-quality.</p><p>Consumer reform includes the reform of individual and collective consumer behaviour caused by our civilization and modern lifestyle.

But ethical reform is difficult because it does not come from simply giving lectures. We must therefore recognize that reforms of thinking and education have become the fundamental problems of humanity on a global scale. However, the education system established in the West for over two centuries has now become universal. And this system does not make us capable of handling problems that are of both a fundamental and global nature. Why ? Because we have a teaching methodology that is fragmented and compartmentalised, in which learning is imparted by a disciplinary logic that separates items of knowledge instead of linking them. We thus need a reform of how we think so that all the separate elements may join together in symbiosis, in synchronism and in confluence.</p><p>Urban reform and rural reform collectively imply other reforms, and that these reforms constitute part of a general policy to create a new path in our future. If this new path develops and the old one perishes, humanity will accede to a new level, namely to a global society which, without renouncing nations, without renouncing differences and peculiarities, without renouncing originality and without renouncing homelands, will incorporate them in the concept of a common human destiny on Homeland Earth.</p>", "publisher": "La Tribune Hebdomadaire", "instances": ["How then can a rural world, which is extremely narrow demographically and driven mainly by industrialised agriculture and breeding, healthily nourish a huge urban fabric ?
