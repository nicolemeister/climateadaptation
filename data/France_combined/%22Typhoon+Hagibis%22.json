The virus's ripple effects are hitting Japan particularly hard: China is its largest trading partner and by far its biggest source of visitors, many of whom come ready to shop.</p><p>The spread of the coronavirus inside Japan itself also presents a wild card. The country has had the most confirmed cases outside China, with more than 400, including those from a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama. Last week, Japan recorded its first death from the virus.</p><p>But China's ban on group travel as it tries to contain the outbreak is the more immediate economic threat to Japan.

Japanese exports to China were down 7.6 percent in 2019 from the previous year.</p><p>The epidemic has also affected operations of Japanese companies inside China. In response to the virus, the Chinese authorities extended the Lunar New Year holiday, effectively shutting down manufacturing work for many Japanese companies.</p><p>The toymaker Tomy lowered its earnings estimates for the end of the financial year, which closes March 31, because of a slowdown in production in China, Japan's national broadcaster, NHK, reported. Nintendo has said it will delay shipments of its Switch console to Japanese consumers as a result of the outbreak.</p><p>Addressing investors this month, Hiroki Totoki, a top executive at Sony, warned that the outbreak could have a \"major impact on our supply chain, logistics and sales,\" potentially erasing a projected increase in earnings growth.</p><p>But perhaps no businesses in Japan are feeling the effects of the epidemic as much as those dependent on tourism, which has grown significantly in importance to the Japanese economy in recent years. The number of visitors to Japan has more than tripled over the last decade, reaching 31 million in 2018, according to government statistics.</p><p>More than 30 percent of those visitors came from China - almost nine in 10 for vacation - making the country the largest source of tourists to Japan.</p><p>While visitors from South Korea and Taiwan - second and third in Japan's tourism rankings - spend most of their money on sightseeing, Chinese travelers tend to shop.</p><p>Busloads of Chinese bargain hunters - leery of high taxes and knockoff products at home - descend on Tokyo's upscale shopping districts to buy foreign and domestic goods in a flurry of consumption known in Japan as bakugai, or \"explosive shopping.\"</p><p>By propping up domestic consumption as Japan's population declines, visitors from China make an outsize contribution to the country's bottom line.</p><p>\"If you look at consumption patterns of Chinese visitors to Japan, a lot of people are buying things like makeup,\" said Keiji Kanda, a senior economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research, adding that \"places like department stores and drugstores are likely to be heavily impacted.\"</p><p>Some hope, though, could be around the corner. Mr. Natori, who owns the sweets shop near the Sensoji temple, said he was looking forward to the cherry blossom season, when tourism usually booms.</p><p>In anticipation of that, he plans to use the downtime to \"think up a seasonal menu.\"</p><p>Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["TOKYO - Japan's economy has already been staggered by a devastating typhoon and a wallet-shutting tax increase.

Officials in Kuma, a village on the banks of a fast-moving river in southwestern Japan, urged everyone to evacuate. Yet inside the Senjuen nursing home, the 70 residents were left in place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The decision proved disastrous. The rain that fell early Saturday was even worse than expected, a blinding downpour that soon inundated the village's streets. Caretakers in the nursing home, which lacked an elevator, struggled to move residents to the second floor. For 14 of them, it was too late - the river breached its banks, killing them in its floodwaters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The events at the nursing home were the deadliest in a week of floods and landslides that have killed 62 people in Kyushu, Japan's southwesternmost main island. They represent a collision of two powerful forces shaping the country's present and future: demographic change and global warming.</p><p>In recent years, climate change has spurred more torrential rains in Japan, causing deadly flooding and mudslides in a nation with many rivers and mountains. The people most vulnerable to the risks of this extreme weather are the elderly, of which Japan has the highest proportion in the world.</p><p>Nursing homes, especially those with small, overtaxed staffs, face particular challenges because of how difficult it can be to evacuate aging, frail people in the midst of disaster.</p><p>The rains this week, which have killed mostly people over age 65, flooded more than 50 nursing homes in Kyushu, where Japan's Meteorological Agency ordered more than a million people within Kumamoto and Kagoshima Prefectures to evacuate. Two years ago, when flooding and landslides killed 237 people across 14 prefectures in western Japan, about three-fifths were over 65.</p><p>\"Now that Japan is getting older and older and the intensity of rainfall is increasing year by year,\" said Kenichi Tsukahara, a professor in the disaster risk reduction research center at Kyushu University, \"we have double difficulties.\"</p><p>This year, the coronavirus pandemic is adding an extra layer of complexity. As people evacuate to gyms and other community centers, social distancing can be difficult. The elderly are again more vulnerable: The virus kills older people at a far higher rate. Of the 981 people who have died from the coronavirus in Japan, more than 80 percent were 70 or older.</p><p>Fears of the virus may discourage older residents from leaving their homes, even when it is dangerous to stay. And if they do go to evacuation centers, they could be at risk for heatstroke - especially at sites with poor air conditioning - because of the need to wear masks.</p><p>It could create \"a very tough situation for people to be able to breathe comfortably during heat waves,\" said Hisashi Nakamura, a professor at the climate science laboratory at the University of Tokyo.</p><p>Although the Japanese gird every June and July for the rainy season - known as tsuyu - this year the rainfall has set records in Kyushu, with more rain expected to blanket central Japan by the end of this week.</p><p>Older residents accustomed to year after year of summer rains may believe they know how to ride out the downpours at home. Yet they may not understand the growing severity of the rains or the increased dangers of flooding.</p><p>\"Under the emerging impact of global warming, there is an increasing risk or potential that rainfall amounts could be at a level that we haven't experienced in the past,\" Professor Nakamura said. \"So I think that citizens must realize that their previous experience may no longer work. We have to act even earlier or faster than what we have experienced in the past.\"</p><p>Evacuation itself can pose a risk to the elderly. Conditions in evacuation centers inevitably fall short of those in nursing homes designed for old-age care. For the frailest patients, the moves can cause injury or destabilize long-term care plans.</p><p>Facility operators have mixed feelings about evacuations, said Hajime Kagiya, a professor of disaster management at Atomi University in Tokyo. \"They have to be mindful of the health conditions of the residents as well as choosing a place to evacuate to,\" he said. \"So they tend to take their time in making the decision to evacuate.\"</p><p>The Japanese government issues standardized evacuation protocols, but they do not take into account the unique characteristics or terrain in different parts of the country, said Professor Tsukahara of Kyushu University. In rural areas, many small villages are isolated and populated by mostly aging residents, with few local resources to help with disaster planning or, in the event of a crisis, to assist with evacuation or rescue.</p><p>In the case of the Senjuen nursing home, Aki Goto, its director, told The Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun, a local newspaper, that she had been more concerned about mudslides than flooding. When the waters came, she added, the caregivers could not move quickly enough to move all the residents upstairs.</p><p>Six of the workers were on call the night of the floods last weekend, the newspaper reported. That still left each caregiver in charge of more than 10 aging residents, some of whom were unable to walk without help. Even with the aid of local volunteers, they could not bring everyone to safety upstairs as the floodwaters rapidly rose and deluged the ground floor.</p><p>According to Shigemitsu Sakoda, 53, the president of Land Earth, a local rafting and outdoor sports company who assisted with the rescue effort at Senjuen, only the caretakers and two local volunteer firefighters were moving residents when Mr. Sakoda arrived to help around noon on Saturday.</p><p>\"It's a really tough job for such a small number of people to carry up those who cannot walk to the second floor,\" Mr. Sakoda said in a telephone interview. By the time troops from the Japan Self-Defense Forces arrived to rescue the nursing home residents from the roof, some had already died below.</p><p>Three years ago, the Japanese government revised a law that requires nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for the disabled and schools located in flood zones to develop evacuation plans and conduct regular drills. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, just over a third of the country's 68,000 facilities had evacuation plans on record by March of last year.</p><p>The importance of these efforts was illustrated last fall when Typhoon Hagibis, a record-breaking storm, slammed into the greater Tokyo area. As a power outage rendered elevators inoperable at a nursing home in Kawagoe, in the exurban prefecture of Saitama, 24 caregivers who had rigorously planned and drilled were able to move all 120 residents to the second floor in the middle of the night.</p><p>The following day, all of the residents - most in their 80s and 90s and many suffering from dementia - were rescued by local firefighters, prefectural police officers and national Self-Defense Forces troops.</p><p>Some disaster experts say that too often, local municipalities are left to handle evacuations without much help from the national government until a dramatic rescue operation is required.</p><p>\"These floods are not one-off 'black swan' events that could not be anticipated,\" said Kyle Cleveland, a professor of sociology at the Tokyo campus of Temple University who has studied the Japanese government response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.</p><p>\"Despite having highly trained staff, world-class equipment and well-established emergency response plans,\" he added, \"when things go sideways, this lack of coordination between state, prefectural and local authorities inordinately delays the response, leaving vulnerable citizens unnecessarily exposed to harm.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe initially dispatched about 10,000 Self-Defense Forces troops to Kyushu over the weekend. Earlier this week, he doubled the number to 20,000, along with 60,000 police officers, firefighters and Coast Guard rescue workers.</p><p>With the ferocity of floods and landslides intensifying in Japan, some experts suggested that nursing homes and other facilities that cater to the elderly may simply have to move.</p><p>The Senjuen home in Kuma, for example, \"is located in a hazardous area,\" said Dr. Kagiya of Atomi University.

The growth arises from the strong 2019 successive renewals, and also benefits from the very robust H2 2018 renewals particularly in the US. SCOR estimates the cost of natural catastrophes in Q4 2019 at EUR 343 million after retrocession and before tax. The fourth quarter of 2019 has registered a high severity of natural catastrophe events worldwide, in particular coming from typhoons in Japan. SCOR estimates the cost of Japanese typhoon Hagibis at EUR 227 million after retrocession and before tax based upon cedants' information and assuming an insured market loss in the region of USD 8 billion. Our efficient retro program would allow SCOR to materially dampen the increase in the loss, should Hagibis deviate beyond our current estimate of market loss assumption. Following an upward market loss revision of Japanese typhoon Faxai and the impact of other events during the fourth quarter, SCOR estimates the cost of Q4 2019 QTD natural catastrophes at EUR 343 million after retrocession and before tax, and at EUR 665 million after retrocession and before tax for the full year. While remaining within SCOR's risk appetite and thanks to its efficient capital shield policy, SCOR Global P&amp;C expects to record an actual net combined ratio below 100% for full year 2019, including natural catastrophe costs. In 2019, SCOR continues to demonstrate its shock-absorbing capacity and pursues the execution of its strategic plan \"Quantum Leap\" with a very strong solvency position and an unchanged dividend policy. Jean-Paul Conoscente, CEO of SCOR Global P&amp;C, comments: \"As the reinsurance market did not fully react to loss perspectives as we had initially anticipated, SCOR maintains a disciplined underwriting approach as evidenced during the January 2020 renewals."]}, {"relevance_score": 16, "title": "Japan rescuers seek survivors after deadly Typhoon Hagibis", "published": "2019-10-14", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The death toll mounted throughout the day Sunday as bodies were recovered from flooded homes and cars, buildings caught in landslides, and swollen rivers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dead included a municipal worker whose car was overcome by floodwaters and at least five Chinese crew members aboard a boat that sank in Tokyo Bay on Saturday night.</p><p>\"Twelve crew were on board.

The storm delivered high winds and record-breaking precipitation to a large portion of Honshu from Mie Prefecture in the west to Iwate in the north. Storm surge raised sea levels by more than 1 meter above mean sea level along parts of the coast.The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its Level 5, or highest level, special warning for heavy rain; unprecedented rainfall followed. A wide swath of Honshu just outside the Tokyo metro area received between 250 mm and 500+ mm (10 and 20+ inches) of rain; the resort town of Hakone, where 939.5 mm (37 inches) of precipitation was recorded, broke the calendar-day rainfall record for all of Japan. Hakone's rainfall represents the second-heaviest 24-hour rainfall ever recorded in Japan-25 inches (635 mm) of the 37 inches fell in just 12 hours. Many regions received between 30% and 40% of their yearly rainfall in just two days, with more than 100 stations breaking daily rainfall records at those locations. As a result of the large swath of unprecedented rainfall in Honshu, numerous rivers-the Abukuma, Arakawa, Chikuma, Kuji, Naka, Shinano, Tone, and Watarase rivers among them-experienced severe and devastating flooding.</p><p>According to AIR, of the ~540 river gauging stations on Honshu island, more than 85 exceeded their 100-year return period peak flows, with more than 100 exceeding their historical records. In addition, shortly before Hagibis made landfall, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the region-parts of which were in the early stages of recovery from Typhoon Faxai, which struck just one month prior.Much of central and eastern Japan experienced severe flooding and landslides; power outages and travel disruption were widespread.</p><p>Because of the intense rainfall within a short time period, much of the floodwater has a high mud content and includes a large amount of debris; this could potentially increase the costs of repair and cleanup and drive up business interruption losses-especially for commercial and industrial properties. In addition, Hagibis impacted some of the same region damaged by Typhoon Faxai a few weeks earlier. Additional damage caused by Hagibis to properties that were damaged by Faxai but were not repaired would further complicate claims settlements.</p><p>AIR's modeled insured loss estimates<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">include</emphasis>:</p><p>Insured damage to property (residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural/mutual), structures and their contents, as well as extra expenses and debris removal, and automobile from wind, storm surge, and inland flood.</p><p>AIR's modeled insured loss estimates<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">do not include</emphasis>:</p><p>LandslideLosses from tornado or earthquakeLosses to landLosses to infrastructureLosses to CAR/EAR, marine hull, or marine cargo lines of businessBusiness interruption lossesLoss adjustment expensesDemand surge-the increase in costs of materials, services, and labor due to increased demand following a catastrophic event; demand surge can be applied by AIR software users who want to account for this variable</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About AIR Worldwide</emphasis>AIR Worldwide (AIR) provides risk modeling solutions that make individuals, businesses, and society more resilient to extreme events.

A little over an hour later, the levee burst, submerging his home and sweeping away everything in it. He barely escaped: Minutes before, he had driven to higher ground after being warned by volunteer firefighters to flee. </p><p>The levee, in an area northwest of Tokyo, was one of at least 55 breached as Typhoon Hagibis dumped record-breaking rains on Japan last weekend, with more than 70 people dying in the storm and floodwaters hitting more than 10,000 homes. </p><p>Japan, a nation grimly accustomed to natural disasters, has invested many billions of dollars in a world-class infrastructure meant to soften nature's wrath. But with the flooding in areas across central and northern Japan in recent days, the country has been forced to examine more deeply the assumptions that undergird its flood control system.</p><p>That is raising a difficult question, for Japan and for the world: Can even the costliest systems be future-proofed in an age of storms made more powerful by climate change? </p><p>Yasuo Nihei, a professor of river engineering at the Tokyo University of Science, said that in places around Japan, \"we're observing rain of a strength that we have never experienced. When we look at the costs, I think it's clear that flood control programs need to be accelerated.\"</p><p>Even so, he said, \"realistically, there will be rains you can't defend against.\"</p><p>That has not always been the view of the Japanese government. For centuries, it has seen disaster management as a problem to be solved by engineering. </p><p>After a devastating typhoon killed more than 1,200 people in the late 1950s, Japan embarked on a series of public works projects aimed at taming its many rivers. Levees and dams sprang up on nearly every river, and civil engineers sheathed long stretches of riverbeds in concrete.</p><p>While the projects have saved countless lives, they are insufficient to meet the challenge of increasingly extreme weather patterns, said Shiro Maeno, a professor of hydraulic engineering at Okayama University.</p><p>\"In the current state, it wouldn't be strange for a flood to happen anytime, anywhere,\" Mr. Maeno said. \"Things we never could have considered have started happening in the last few years.\"</p><p>The heavy investment in infrastructure has not come without a cost. The spending has helped send Japan's national debt to record highs, as the country has approved many projects that turned out to be minimally effective or, at worst, damaging to the environment. </p><p>The Japanese government has also\u00a0used infrastructure spending to stimulate an economy that was stagnant for decades. Critics note that some of the projects are little more than a tool for enriching construction companies, with part of the proceeds being returned to local politicians in the form of campaign donations. </p><p>Whatever the motivation for the spending, engineers are warning that as storms grow in intensity, the government faces diminishing returns as it contemplates raising levees or digging new drainage tunnels. But in the wake of the typhoon, the burning question among Japanese politicians is whether the country should be investing even more. </p><p>Daniel Aldrich, a professor of political science at Northeastern University in Boston who studies disaster management, said that huge engineering projects had often provided a false sense of security, leading people to avoid what can be a more effective response: evacuation. </p><p>\"Why would you possibly leave when you have this system set up to protect you?\" he said. \"Why go anywhere? It's a moral hazard when you believe the systems in place will protect you more than the process of fleeing, which is of course what we really want.\"</p><p>In 2017, the national government passed a revision to the country's flood and river controls laws aimed at decreasing the mounting economic damage from extreme weather and bringing the number of deaths caused by the failure to evacuate down to zero - a challenge made greater by the country's rapidly aging population. </p><p>The changes have forced local governments to revise how they prepare for disasters.

At a temple close to the river, a wooden pole more than 10 feet tall records the area's major floods.

Cranes lowered giant concrete blocks shaped like jacks into the breach, then covered them with dirt. On the far side of the levee, where low fields run to the riverbank, hundreds of apple trees were covered to their crowns in muddy water.</p><p>Here and there, residents took the first steps toward recovery, shoveling out their homes and dragging away waterlogged furniture.</p><p>\"We're lucky,\" Mr. Ogawa's daughter Natsumi said in front of her parents' stately home, one of many houses built with money from the orchards. \"All of our furniture got washed away, so there's not much to clean up.\"</p><p>Mr. Ogawa himself was not quite so sanguine. His home and his apple business will recover, he said, but he's not sure he ever will.</p><p>\"Even if the levee is fixed, every time there's a heavy rain or a typhoon, my chest is going to tighten,\" he said.</p><p>\"I want to move to a place where my family can live without worrying.\"</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["\"I had faith that it was built to withstand a hundred-year flood, so it should be O.

He barely escaped: Minutes before, he had driven to higher ground after being warned by volunteer firefighters to flee. The levee, in an area northwest of Tokyo, was one of at least 55 breached as Typhoon Hagibis dumped record-breaking rains on Japan last weekend, with more than 70 people dying in the storm and floodwaters hitting more than 10,000 homes. Japan, a nation grimly accustomed to natural disasters, has invested many billions of dollars in a world-class infrastructure meant to soften nature's wrath. But with the flooding in areas across central and northern Japan in recent days, the country has been forced to examine more deeply the assumptions that undergird its flood control system. That is raising a difficult question, for Japan and for the world: Can even the costliest systems be future-proofed in an age of storms made more powerful by climate change? Yasuo Nihei, a professor of river engineering at the Tokyo University of Science, said that in places around Japan, \"we're observing rain of a strength that we have never experienced. When we look at the costs, I think it's clear that flood control programs need to be accelerated.", "Last summer, Nagano city, which administers Naganuma, where Mr. Ogawa's house was inundated, redrew its flood maps.

In 4Q19, the region's oil demand should increase by 350 kb/d y-o-y. LPG/ethane demand, in particular, should rise by 230 kb/d. Ethane demand was impacted in August by steam cracker outages in the US and rebounded in September, showing growth of 150 kb/d y-o-y. Ethane demand should further improve in 4Q19, as new steam crackers increase their utilisation rates. Jet/kerosene and gasoline demand should increase y-o-y by 90 kb/d and 70 kb/d, respectively.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">US</emphasis> oil deliveries grew 140 kb/d y-o-y in September and preliminary data point to a rise of 130 kb/d in October, driven by gasoline and LPG/ethane. Ethane demand recovered in September, following a drop of 115 kb/d m-o-m in August, in part due to a fire at ExxonMobil's Baytown, Texas, petrochemical plant, which is expected to keep part of the facility off-line until year-end. The ramp up of several new ethane crackers should support 4Q19 ethane demand.</p><p>Jet fuel demand should also post strong growth of close to 80 kb/d in 4Q19. Domestic air traffic rose by 5.9% y-o-y in September and 4.1% in October. Weekly data for October and November point to strong growth in jet/kerosene demand. Gasoline consumption, benefitting from lower y-o-y prices and unemployment at record low levels, should increase by 60 kb/d y-o-y in 4Q19. Diesel demand is expected to remain slightly below last year.</p><p>Overall, US oil demand growth is expected to accelerate to 130 kb/d in 2020, after growing by 35 kb/d in 2019. LPG/ethane will be responsible for 200 kb/d of growth in 2020, offsetting declines in other fuels. Gasoline, for example, is expected to fall by 80 kb/d on efficiency improvements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mexican</emphasis> oil demand declined by 40 kb/d y-o-y in September, based on data reported by Pemex. We expect oil demand to rise by around 20 kb/d overall in 2019 and then 5 kb/d in 2020. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OECD Americas</emphasis> oil demand is expected to grow by 130 kb/d in 2019 and 140 kb/d in 2020. LPG/ethane will be responsible for 100 kb/d of this growth in 2019 and 210kb/d in 2020.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OECD Europe</emphasis></h><p>Oil consumption in OECD Europe fell 100 kb/d y-o-y in 3Q19, the sixth straight quarterly decline, with continuing falls in LPG and naphtha deliveries. The European petrochemical industry has suffered from a slowdown in global economic activity and from US competition. Ethane demand has also been impacted by unplanned cracker maintenance. On the contrary, demand for gasoil, gasoline and jet fuel has continued to grow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">German</emphasis> oil demand fell 30 kb/d in September and 70 kb/d in October, according to provisional data. Naphtha and jet/kerosene demand were particularly weak. German oil demand has been severely impacted by current economic difficulties and is expected to increase by only 5 kb/d in 2019 and to decline by 20 kb/d in 2020.</p><p>In the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UK</emphasis>, LPG/ethane deliveries fell by 40 kb/d y-o-y in August and 50 kb/d in September on steam cracker incidents. One incident that occurred in early August is now resolved (at the Wilton Sabic petrochemical plant) but another unexpected shutdown is likely to continue until December (at the Fife Exxon/Shell cracker), reducing ethane demand in 4Q19.</p><p>Fuel demand in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netherlands</emphasis> likely reflected the behaviour of bunker retailers, who emptied their high sulphur fuel oil inventories ahead of the IMO specification change. After getting rid of the high sulphur material, bunker sellers started to refill their tanks with very low sulphur fuel oil in September. These changes affect tertiary storage facilities, not recorded in primary oil stocks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">French</emphasis> oil demand rose by a strong 70 kb/d y-o-y in September, before posting a drop of 100 kb/d in October, according to provisional data. Heating oil deliveries, in particular, were 55 kb/d lower than last year in October. We expect French oil demand to grow by 10 kb/d in 2019 and to remain stagnant in 2020. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Italian</emphasis> oil demand fell by a significant 50 kb/d y-o-y in September. Preliminary data point to a decline of 15 kb/d in October. Italian deliveries fell by 150 kb/d in 1Q19, 110 kb/d in 2Q19 and 80 kb/d in 3Q19. They are expected to remain stagnant y-o-y in 4Q19 in comparison with weak deliveries in 4Q18.</p><p>After falling 130 kb/d in 2018 and 70 kb/d in 2019, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OECD Europe's</emphasis> oil demand should post growth of 90 kb/d in 2020, supported by relatively low oil prices and a comparison with a very weak start in 2019.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OECD Asia Oceania</emphasis></h><p>Oil demand in OECD Asia Oceania fell by 110 kb/d in 3Q19. Over 4Q19, consumption should rise by 120 kb/d.

Korea reduced fuel taxes by about 15% in October 2018 in order to boost consumer spending and this tax break ended at the end of August 2019.</p><p>As a result, August consumption rose by 140 kb/d and September demand declined by 100 kb/d y-o-y. September consumption fell 70 kb/d y-o-y for diesel and 35 kb/d for gasoline. In October, however, demand growth was strong (up 150 kb/d y-o-y) due to very weak 2018 deliveries.

In October, preliminary data point to an acceleration of the y-o-y fall to 200 kb/d as all products posted strong negative growth. The sharp y-o-y drop in October is likely due to the implementation of higher consumption taxes from 1 October and disruptions associated with Typhoon Hagibis.
