The largest peacetime evacuation in Australian history is underway.Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Saturday that Australia has called up 3,000 military reserves to fight the country's ongoing wildfire crisis, the biggest call-up in living memory.The announcement was made the same day two people lost their lives to the fires.Australia has been preparing mass evacuations over the weekend as it braces itself for one of the worst days thus far in the disaster.\"Today's decision puts more boots on the ground, puts more planes in the sky, puts more ships at sea,\" said Morrison, who has been heavily criticized for his response to the monthslong crisis.\"The scale of the fires is stretching resources on the ground and there are clearly communities that need additional help,\" Morrison said. The reserve brigades will assist in delivering supplies to rural communities, evacuate people threatened by the fires, and help reopen roads. </p><p>Defense helicopters and planes are being deployed to help with logistics support and evacuations. A further \u20ac12.5 million ($14 million) would be spent to lease four firefighting planes. Morrison also said defense force bases will be used to provide temporary accommodation.In Australia, managing bushfires is normally the responsibility of state governments and fire services, but due to the scale of the disaster, a national response is required, Morrison said.Death toll rises Authorities confirmed that two people died due to wildfires on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, bringing the overall nationwide death toll to at least 23.The island, popular with tourists and famous for its wildlife, also lost large parts of its Flinders Chase National Park to the blazes. Fires began on December 20 and have now burnt more than 1,000 square kilometres (386 square miles) of land.\"There will be very significant wildlife losses on the island,\" said South Australia premier Steven Marshall.

Conservationists say it's \"one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history.\"Unprecedented bushfires that ravaged Australia in 2019 and 2020 killed or displaced almost 3 billion animals, according to an interim report released Tuesday.Compiled by scientists from several Australian universities, the survey said the blazes impacted an estimated 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51 million frogs. </p><p>The report, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), did not specify how many animals may have died. But the prospects for those that escaped the fires \"were probably not great\" because they lost food sources, native habitat and shelter from predators, report co-author Chris Dickman said. The bushfires that swept across Australia between late 2019 and early 2020 scorched 115,000 square kilometers (44,000 square miles) of bush and forest, killing 30 people and destroying thousands of homes.

Political protests in numerous countries, the recent tensions between the US and Iran and the trade war between Washington and Beijing  remain negative factors that can weigh on growth, along with weather-related disasters, including the Australian bushfires.  'We are all adjusting to live with the new normal of higher uncertainty,' IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said in Davos, Switzerland, presenting the forecast one day before the start of the annual World Economic Forum summit of political and corporate leaders.  Georgieva said that recent data suggests positive trends in international trade and industrial output, 'but we have not reached a turning point yet.'   The easing of monetary policy in key economies helped boost global growth in 2019 and likely will continue to have carry-over effects on economic recovery, the IMF said, also noting generally positive consumer spending trends.  Global growth is projected to increase to 3.3 per cent in 2020 from about 2.9 per cent last year, and edge up to 3.4 per cent in 2021.  Compared to the previous outlook published in October, this marks a 0.1-percentage-point reduction for this year and lowers the forecast by 0.2 percentage points for next year.   The IMF noted underperformance in several emerging markets, including India. China's growth is starting to slow.  In the US, growth is expected to moderate from an estimated 2.3 per cent last year to 2 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent in 2021. Japan, too, is expected to have growth moderate from an estimated 1 per cent in 2019 to 0.7 per cent in 2020.
