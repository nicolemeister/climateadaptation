'Fortunately, fewer and fewer people are dying in natural disasters,' said Ernst Rauch, the Munich-based company's chief climate and geo scientist.  Around 9,000 people were killed by natural disasters in 2019, with Cyclone Idai, which struck Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, accounting for over 1,000 of those deaths.  Despite the high numbers in its annual report on natural catastrophes, Munich Re said the casualties were in fact relatively few when taking the past three decades into account. Over that period, the average annual death toll comes to 52,000.  'This is a development that bucks the population trend. The world has in this sense improved,' Rauch said.  He attributed this to a number of factors. 'What is very decisive is warning the population and evacuation, which was significantly better than it has been in previous decades,' the expert said.  'There was a cyclone in Bangladesh in 1991 which more than 100,000 fatalities. Today that is far less probable,' he added.  Material damages, however, were as high as ever. In 2019, these amounted to 150 billion dollars worldwide, in keeping with the long-term average.  The insurance sector assumed more than a third of those costs (52 billion dollars), while the remainder was uninsured.  Europe experienced a summer of heat waves and stormy weather last year, which caused damages worth 2.5 billion dollars.  The most costly natural catastrophe last year, according to Munich Re, was Japan's Typhoon Hagibis, which brought with it destruction estimated to be worth 17 billion dollars.  Rauch pointed to 'record losses from typhoons for the second year in a row' in Japan. In some areas, Typhoon Hagibis brought more than 1,000 millilitres of rain within 24 hours. 'That is more than the average rainfall of a whole year in Germany.'  Rauch drew parallels between the extreme weather and climate change - a subject that shaped politics in 2019 and inspired a global youth movement for the environment spearheaded by teen activist Greta Thunberg.  'The paths of low- and high-pressure areas have slowed in recent years. Such changes can lead to risky weather situations such as heat waves or prolonged heavy precipitation,' Rauch commented.  The company also noted that hail and storms had increased in strength and frequency across parts of Central Europe and North America.  'The chain of evidence suggests that there is very likely a link to climate change,' Rauch added.  He also mentioned the ongoing bushfires in Australia, saying that while such events were not uncommon during that region's summer period, 'what is unusual is the early start in the fire season and the dimension.'  The stormy outlook as well as rising sea levels will mean greater costs for insurers in the future, Rauch warned. 'It will take less than decades before urgent countermeasures are needed.'

The reading was revised down from an initially estimated 6.3 per cent contraction, the Cabinet Office said.

Weather authorities have warned of mudslides, flooding, 'ferocious' winds, record rainfall and a storm surge.   The storm caused more than 1,660 flights to be cancelled, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK, while many train services, including high-speed bullet train services, were halted in eastern and central Japan, operators said.  The Formula 1 teams worked hard on Friday to pack things up and keep sensitive technology from getting wet.  Formula 1 drivers had different approaches to the unexpected day off. Some wanted to distract themselves by playing video games, while Sebastian Vettel said he'd take some exercise indoors.  World champion Lewis Hamilton said he was considering visiting the coast at Taiji, where dolphins and other small whales are killed. He said he wanted to draw attention to the controversial practice.  Hamilton is on course for a sixth world title as he leads the standings by 73 points from Valtteri Bottas of Finland. Bottas recorded the fastest lap in both the first and second practice sessions on Friday.  Hamilton cannot clinch the crown in Suzuka although Mercedes could claim a sixth consecutive constructors' title should results go their way.

Suzuka, JAPAN (dpa-AFX) - The streets near Shiroko Station in Suzuka are empty. Formula One fans are not in sight this Saturday in the city in Mie Prefecture.  Typhoon Hagibis has brought motorsport's premier event to a standstill at the circuit about 300 kilometres as the crow flies southwest of the capital Tokyo.  As a precaution against the threatening weather front, the organizers of the 17th of the season's 21 Formula One races cancelled all activities for the day.  F1 officials had taken the decision on Friday to move qualifying from Saturday to before Sunday's race. Saturday practice was also scrapped for safety reasons.   'This is a perfectly understandable decision. Safety is paramount,' said Ferrari team chief Mattia Binotto.  Hagibis is projected to make landfall in eastern or central Japan Saturday evening. Weather authorities have warned of mudslides, flooding, 'ferocious' winds, record rainfall and a storm surge.   The Formula 1 teams worked hard on Friday to pack things up and keep sensitive technology from getting wet. By Sunday, the tropical storm should be heading north, with the race scheduled to start at 2.10 pm (0510 GMT).  'The big question mark will be in what condition the course is in,' said Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel.  Should qualification also be cancelled because of adverse conditions, the starting rows will be based on Friday's second practice when Valtteri Bottas in a Mercedes was 0.1 seconds quicker than team-mate Lewis Hamilton.  Max Verstappen in a Red Bull was third ahead of the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Vettel.  Drivers had different approaches to the unexpected day off. Some wanted to distract themselves by playing video games, while Vettel said he would take some exercise indoors.  World champion Hamilton said he was considering visiting the coast at Taiji, where dolphins and other small whales are killed. He said he wanted to draw attention to the controversial practice.  Hamilton is on course for a sixth world title as he leads the standings by 73 points over Bottas with five races remaining.  Hamilton cannot clinch the crown in Suzuka although Mercedes could claim a sixth consecutive constructors' title and and ensure that no driver from another team can win the drivers' championship should results go their way.  While the drivers rested, event organizers and team members worked hard behind the scenes to make the paddock stormproof. They will have to work equally as hard to get the track and equipment back up and running when the weather front has passed.  Teams are being allowed to send selected employees to the otherwise closed circuit in order to monitor the state of their own equipment.  'From an F1 operations perspective, implementing our extreme weather plan will require a significant effort,' said Andrew James, F1 technical director.  'It will need an 'all hands on deck' approach to accomplish.'

Bottas took the chequered flag at Suzuka ahead of Sebastian Vettel in a Ferrari and Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who can now capture his sixth world championship title at the Mexican GP in two weeks.  Ferrari had taken a one-two in the day's earlier qualifying - put back a day to Sunday as a result of Typhoon Hagibis - but the Italian team's race was compromised within seconds of the start.  Bottas was able to jump both Ferraris from third on the grid to take the lead, and the Finn went on to win his third race this season, his first in Japan and the sixth of his Formula One career.  'I had a really nice start and Sebastian had an issue so I got the lead and the pace was super good. I enjoyed it and had fun,' Bottas said.  'I'm really proud to be part of the team; sixth title in a row is so impressive and proud of every team member here at the race well done guys and girls.'  The results - with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc seventh - means only a Mercedes driver can now win the drivers' title, making it a record sixth constructors' and drivers' title double for the team.  Mercedes have matched Ferrari's record of six straight constructors' titles from 1999-2004 and have also continued their domination at Suzuka, where they have now won the last six races.  Pole-sitter Vettel lost his lead from the start when he nudged forward and then stopped before accelerating, but was cleared by stewards of making a false start.  'The lights were on a long time, so it was my mistake. I lost the momentum. It was a really poor start,' Vettel said.  Team-mate Leclerc then collided with the Red Bull of Max Verstappen on the first turn. The Dutchman span off and later vented his anger over team radio after hearing there would be no investigation.  Stewards reviewed the incident again after the race and issued time penalties which dropped Leclerc a place after he finished sixth on the track.  Both drivers could continue but Leclerc's front wing was damaged and a piece late flew off, knocking the wing mirror off Hamilton's car behind him. Verstappen eventually had to retire on lap 15 of the 53 laps.  Conditions were dry but blustery after the typhoon had moved further north, and after the early drama Bottas was able to build up a lead from the front.  It became a question of tyre strategies and Hamilton at one stage appeared unhappy with his team's tactics.  After second stops by Vettel and Bottas, Hamilton was able to lead from lap 37. Bottas on the faster softs to Hamilton's mediums was some 10 seconds behind with 15 laps to go and told his team-mate would have to pit again.  That turned out to be the case with 10 laps remaining, putting Bottas back in front more than 10 seconds ahead of Vettel and 15 seconds up on his team-mate.  Hamilton on the fresher tyres was able to attack Vettel towards the end, but he was unable to get into a position to overtake and had to settle a close third - with a bonus point for fastest lap - as Bottas took the chequered flag.  'Firstly it's congratulations to the team to win it six times in a row,' Hamilton said. 'I really just wanted to get the best points for the team today.'  Red Bull's Alexander Albon was a career-best fourth, ahead of Carlos Sainz in a McLaren, Daniel Ricciardo in a Renault, Leclerc, Pierre Gasly in a Toro Rosso, Nico Huelkenberg in a Renault and Lance Stroll in a Racing Point.  Hamilton has a 64-point lead over Bottas in the drivers' standings with four races left - with a possible 104 points remaining for one driver if he wins all races and gains four bonus points for fastest laps.  Hamilton will take the championship if he is 78 points in front after the Mexican GP. A victory and bonus point for Hamilton in Mexico would be enough if Bottas fails to get on the podium.

Julian Ryall reports from Tokyo.The scourge of nuclear weapons, difficulties facing immigrant communities and the importance of interfaith dialogue are just some of the issues that Pope Francis is expected to address when he arrives in Japan on Saturday for the first papal visit to the Asian country in 38 years. And members of the Catholic Church here anticipate that the pope's visit will breathe new life into their community. </p><p>\"The Catholic community in Japan looks forward to the apostolic visit with sentiments of joy and gratitude to God,\" said Father Joseph Chennoth, the archbishop of Milevi who was appointed to serve as apostolic nuncio to Japan in August 2011. \"It is a great opportunity for Pope Francis to visit Japan, where he wanted to come as a missionary during his youth,\" Chennoth told DW. \"As supreme pastor of the church, he has innumerable pastoral concerns for the universal church spread across the world,\" he added. \"Now he comes to Japan to appreciate the strong faith inherited from the martyrs and to encourage the faithful to share the gospel of joy and compassion.\"Deeply symbolic visitThe pope's visit is indeed rich in symbolism. It is significant that he will open his first official visit to Japan in the city of Nagasaki, where Christianity first gained a foothold in feudal Japan nearly 500 years ago, but is today best known as the second city to have been targeted with an atomic weapon during World War II.The first Christian missionaries arrived in Kyushu, Japan's most southern main island, with Francis Xavier and the Jesuits stepping ashore in the 1540s and were initially successful in converting as many as 130,000 local people and even local \"daimyo,\" or feudal lords.But Emperor Ogimachi began the pushback against what was seen as a foreign influence, and Christianity was repressed from 1587 onward. Opposition to the religion evolved into an outright ban in the early 17th century. Those who refused to reject Christianity were often executed; others \u2014 the \"hidden Christians\" \u2014 continued to practice their faith in secret. Nagasaki is important to the history of Christianity in Japan because six Franciscan missionaries, three Japanese Jesuits and 17 followers of the church, including three boys, were crucified in the city on February 5, 1597, because they refused to recant their faith. Known as the \"Martyrs of Japan,\" they were canonized by the Catholic Church in 1862. The last head of the Catholic Church to visit Japan was Pope John Paul II, who in 1981 also visited Nagasaki and met some of the descendants of the early converts who had managed to keep their faith secret. Christianity returned openly to Japan after Tokyo ended its policy of seclusion from the outside world in 1853, although followers of the Catholic Church still only account for around 440,000 of the 127 million Japanese people. Falling numbers\"The number of Japanese Catholics is declining because of diminishing birth rates, an aging population and the modern pressures of life,\" Father Chennoth said. \"But I am sure that the pope's visit will give a new impetus to Catholics to deepen and share their faith with their fellow men by their commitment to building up a more peaceful, compassionate, humane and inclusive society.\"While the number of Japanese Catholics may be in decline, the rising number of immigrants from deeply Catholic nations in other parts of Asia, such as the Philippines, means that churches here are still busy, said Father Kizito Mawayira. \"This visit by the pope is deeply significant to us because it shows us again the solidarity of the church,\" said Father Kizito, a Ugandan who serves as pastor at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Yokohama.\"We are very much an international congregation and we have people from all over the world attending our masses \u2014 from France and India to the US, South Korea, Poland, the Congo, Croatia and many places in Southeast Asia,\" he said. Some estimates put the number of foreign-born Catholics living in Japan at 520,000, eclipsing the number of Japanese church-goers, with more places of worship now offering masses in different languages. \"We also have Japanese in our congregation, of course, but mostly they are older people,\" Mawayira said. \"For younger people, there are so many things going on with their schools and other groups at the weekend that they do not always have a chance to attend mass.\" Nuclear weapons oppositionMany Catholics are expected to flock to venues where Pope Francis will give a series of addresses, including in Hiroshima \u2014 where he is scheduled to meet with survivors of the atomic bomb that was dropped on the city in 1945 \u2014 and Tokyo.Through his visit, the pope wants to send a strong message calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide. In a video message released by the Vatican ahead of his trip, the pope told the Japanese people: \"Your country knows well the suffering caused by war. Along with you, I pray that the destructive power of nuclear weapons is never let loose again on human history. The use of nuclear weapons is immoral.\" In Japan, Pope Francis will also meet with Emperor Naruhito and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his three-day visit and is expected to express regret for the loss of life associated with the recent deadly Typhoon Hagibis and the nuclear disaster of March 2011 in Fukushima, in northeastern Japan. </p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["Nuclear weapons oppositionMany Catholics are expected to flock to venues where Pope Francis will give a series of addresses, including in Hiroshima \u2014 where he is scheduled to meet with survivors of the atomic bomb that was dropped on the city in 1945 \u2014 and Tokyo.

The Imperial succession had already taken place on 1 May following the abdication of Emperor Akihito, the first such event in almost 200 years. Attended by leaders and representatives from about 180 countries along with heads of judicial, legislative and executive branches of government and representatives of various sectors of society, the Emperor, wearing a formal court dress traditionally worn by emperors called korozen-no-goho, stated: \u201cI now perform the Ceremony of Enthronement at the Seiden State Hall and proclaim my enthronement to those at home and abroad.\u201d</p><p>This was the main event of the Ceremonies of the Accession to the Throne of the Emperor. The Emperor pledged to fulfill his responsibility as the symbol of the state and to wish for the happiness of the people. The Empress wore a junihitoe, a ceremonial robe from the Heian period (late 8th to late 12th century). The Imperial Procession by motorcar was postponed to 10 November. The enthronement ceremony is called Sokuirei-Seiden- no-Go in Japanese. The abdicated Emperor, called now as Emperor Emeritus, was on throne for more than 30 years and had constantly prayed for the happiness of the people and world peace, always sharing the joys and sorrows of the people, and showing compassion through his own bearing.</p><p>Reflecting on this experience of Emperor Akihito, Emperor Naruhito pledged to act according to the Constitution and fulfill his responsibility as the symbol of state and of the unity of the people of Japan. He hoped that Japan through its people\u2019s \u201cwisdom and unceasing efforts, will \u201cachieve further development and contribute to the friendship and peace of the international community and the welfare and prosperity of humankind\u201d. Keeping with tradition, the government sent invitations to 194 countries that Japan recognises as states for the ceremony. The only exception was Syria due to concerns over the atrocious repression by the regime of President Bashar Assad. Of the 194 countries, 183 sent representatives to attend the ceremony.</p><p>In addition, the government sent invitations to the United Nations, the European Union and the Palestinian Authority. The number of countries Japan sent invitations this time increased by about 30 compared with the previous enthronement proclamation ceremony held in 1990, the year after the Heisei era began, mainly because a number of countries had declared their independence following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. More than 70 countries sent to the ceremony their Heads of State, such as Kings and Presidents, while royal family members, Heads of Government, ministers and ambassadors to Japan were guests to attend the ceremony. India was represented by President Ramnath Kovind and his wife. Prime Minister Abe had a busy schedule meeting many foreign dignitaries.</p><p>And they included the Maldives President Ibrahim Solih, Nepal\u2019s President Bidhya Bhandari and Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. Abe held talks with 23 dignitaries, including the Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan, during which the two discussed pending issues between the two countries ahead of the Chinese President, Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit next spring. Abe also had talks with the South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, during which they discussed the wartime labour issue. The Emperor has deep ties with Britain as he studied at the University of Oxford. Prince Charles attended the proclamation ceremony, as he did in 1990, when he was accompanied by Princess Diana.</p><p>The Emperor had attended the wedding of Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI, who too was present along with his wife Queen Letizia during the ceremony. Among other leaders who represented their countries were Cambodia\u2019s King Norodom Sihamoni, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reached Tokyo on 21 October and departed the following day because she has been preoccupied with the prolonged and widespread protests triggered by a contentious bill to revise an ordinance to allow Hong Kong authorities to extradite crime suspects to mainland China for prosecution. Why is the enthronement ceremony significant and why is it important for the Japanese people? The ceremony is centuries- old and the Japanese have preserved this with respect and pride for thousands of years.</p><p>It is deep-rooted with Japanese history and culture and therefore treated with reverence. The series of rituals known as Sokui no Rei was quite elaborate. While Emperor Naruhito (59) and Empress Masako (55) were seated in two ornately decorated thrones, the brother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito, 83-year-old Prince Hitachi, and third in line of succession, watched the proceedings from a wheelchair. Prime Minister Abe stood before Naruhito\u2019s throne, and read a speech. He then bowed deeply and said Banzai (Long live the emperor!). As Naruhito ascended the throne, boxes were placed next to him. These are believed to contain a sword and ancient jewel that, according to legend, date back to the mythical forefather of Japan\u2019s first emperor, Jimmu, who ruled almost 2,700 years ago.</p><p>Along with a fabled octagonal mirror, they form Japan\u2019s royal regalia, or the Three Sacred Treasures. The sword and the jewel are so sacred that they have never been seen in public. The celebrations were tempered somewhat as Japan was reeling from Typhoon Hagibis ~ one of the strongest storms to hit the country in years. The typhoon left over 80 dead and caused extensive damage after it smashed into the country in early October. The devastation prompted the palace to postpone a 4.6-kilometer (2.9-mile) public parade from the Imperial Palace to Akasaka Palace until 10 November. As a special gesture, the government pardoned about 550,000 petty criminals to mark the emperor\u2019s enthronement ceremony.</p><p>In the Chrysanthemum traditions, Naruhito became the 126th Emperor of Japan, the latest in an unbroken line that stretches back 14 centuries. The accession in May also signaled officially the start of the Reiwa era. Each emperor\u2019s reign is marked by the name of that era. Reiwa was adopted from an 8th century anthology of classic poetry and means \u201cbeautiful harmony\u201d. After Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II, the role of the emperor has changed significantly when Naruhito\u2019s grandfather, Emperor Hirohito, sat on the throne. Once considered the living embodiment of gods, the Emperor has become a largely symbolic figure. Unlike other monarchs, Naruhito is a symbol of the state rather than the Head of State, and the Japanese emperor wields no political power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(The writer, a former Senior Fellow at IDSA and until recently ICCR India Chair Professor at Reitaku University, Japan, is currently Lok Sabha Research Fellow and Member of Governing Council, Indian Council of World Affairs, New Delhi)</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Statesman (India)</p>", "publisher": "Asia News Network", "instances": [").
