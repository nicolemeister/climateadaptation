This reflects deeper epistemic and representational gaps within international law. The ICJ's bench remains predominantly male and drawn from elite legal circles.

Serve cold, preferably with a side of exam-induced anxiety that manifests as vehement vomiting or diarrhoea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what if I told you that, after all this academic seasoning, the finished product barely qualifies as half-baked on the global scale? According to the World Bank, Bangladesh's Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) is now functionally equivalent to Grade 7 internationally. Yes, after 12 years of schooling, our students are emerging five years behind the global standard. That's not a learning gap, it's a canyon and not the grand kind.</p><p>Despite noble intentions and plenty of committees with acronyms longer than novels, our national curriculum still operates on one central principle: education is less about learning and more about surviving a system designed to test memory rather than meaning. The National Curriculum Framework 2021 promised to revolutionise education through \"competency-based learning,\" \"integrated assessments,\" and \"lifelong learning skills.\" Lovely. But much like my New Year's resolution to take up pilates, the intentions are there-just not the follow-through.</p><p>The truth is that the curriculum continues to reward regurgitation over reflection. Want proof? Open any board exam script. You'll find students rewarded for copying textbook paragraphs verbatim.</p><p>Science, meanwhile, is less about discovering the world and more about memorising definitions like a corporate compliance manual. Religion is taught as moral absolutes with minimal room for interpretation. And civic education-formally lumped into \"Bangladesh and Global Studies\"-remains stuck in the glorious past of the Liberation War, with little engagement on democratic values, constitutional rights or climate justice. The idea that a student might question why freedom of expression is only celebrated in textbooks and not tolerated in classrooms is, frankly, revolutionary-and not in a way the authorities would appreciate.</p><p>And speaking of values: where is the conversation around consent, gender equity or mental health? We have an entire generation going through puberty with the emotional intelligence of a brick because the word \"sex\" still sends policymakers into a shameful panic. There is no comprehensive sex education, no guidance on bodily autonomy, and no meaningful engagement with the reality of gender-based violence. But sure, let's spend three pages explaining types of sedimentary rocks.</p><p>If we are to believe the curriculum is designed to prepare children for the 21st century, then can someone please explain why financial literacy, digital safety, media misinformation, and climate adaptation are still missing from the syllabus?</p><p>To be fair, the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) has tried to modernise. The new curriculum for classes 1-5, launched in 2023, ditches final exams and introduces continuous assessment. It also encourages thematic learning across disciplines. But implementation has been chaotic. Teachers remain undertrained, class sizes balloon, and textbooks are riddled with errors. According to the 2022 BRAC Education Watch report, only 23 percent of primary school teachers had received in-depth training in competency-based instruction.</p><p>And let's not forget the elephant in the classroom: inequality. Students in elite urban schools get smart classrooms, extracurriculars, and debate clubs. Meanwhile, rural schools still lack toilets, let alone trained teachers for integrated learning. The English version of the national curriculum is marginally better resourced, but it still suffers from the same outdated pedagogy, just in awkwardly translated English.</p><p>The truth is, we need an education system that doesn't just manufacture employees or engineers, but nurtures citizens to become curious, compassionate, and capable of questioning the status quo without fearing that a red pen will ruin their future. This means reimagining the entire philosophy of the curriculum. Ditch rote learning entirely. Revamp textbooks to pose questions, not just provide model answers. Reward analysis over memorisation. Infuse classrooms with real-life context.</p><p>Teachers are the backbone of this transformation, and they must be treated as such. This means proper pay, professional development, and pedagogical freedom-not just strict instructions to finish the syllabus like a robot with a whistle. It also means democratising the curriculum design process. Right now, it's a top-down exercise dominated by bureaucrats, where educators, psychologists, parents, and-dare we suggest-students have minimal input. The 2024 textbook controversy, where glaring errors and politically sanitised omissions made headlines, should be a wake-up call for genuine transparency and public review.</p><p>We also need to audit the relevance of the curriculum. Why are children still learning about out-of-date agricultural production figures instead of sustainable farming practices? Why are their moral lessons framed around obedience, but not empathy or ethics in the digital age? Why is Life Skills Education an occasional workshop rather than a core subject that includes mental health, climate resilience, conflict resolution, and the basics of being a functional adult?</p><p>Until these questions are taken seriously, underneath those perfect GPAs and patriotic essays will remain a grim truth: we are handing out Grade 12 certificates for a Grade 7 education.</p><p>We can either keep producing graduates who top the charts but bottom out on creativity, confidence, and critical consciousness, or we can start treating our children like future leaders.

This steadfast commitment was underscored by the conclusion of the Invest in African Energy forum held in Paris on May 15.  Throughout the forum, key stakeholders from across the continent and beyond convened to address the pressing energy challenges facing Africa. Taking place in Paris - the city where the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2016 - discussions centered on strategies to attract investment, promote sustainable energy development and drive economic growth while prioritizing environmental responsibility, African civil society, human rights groups, environmental groups, governments and the private sector recognize the critical importance of addressing energy poverty, which continues to impede socio-economic progress in many African nations. By fostering an environment conducive to investment and innovation, we Africans aim to unlock the continent's vast energy potential and empower communities with access to reliable, affordable energy sources.  The Paris Declaration calls for fruitful discussions and collaborations, highlighting the shared commitment of African nations, global investors and industry leaders to drive sustainable energy development across the continent.  Moving forward, we remain dedicated to championing Africa's energy agenda, advocating for policies that balance economic growth with environmental stewardship, and empowering African nations to realize their energy potential while advancing climate goals.  We recognize Africa's sovereign right to develop its energy resources - which include north of 125 billion barrels of oil and 620 trillion cubic feet of natural gas - in a balanced and sustainable manner. Ramping up energy investment, deploying continuous finance and advancing energy projects represent Africa's core priorities, as 600 million Africans lack access to reliable power and 900 million Africans lack access to clean cooking fuels. Projects like the TotalEnergies-led Mozambique LNG development and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline seek to maximize Africa's resources for the benefit of local communities. In West Africa, developments such as Perenco's Cap Lopez LNG Terminal and associated LPG facility, the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline and the Eni-led Congo LNG project will catalyze long-term economic growth and energy resilience, with natural gas, LNG and LPG set to play a critical role in the continent's energy poverty reduction strategy. The Southern African region is only just starting to realize the full potential of its oil and gas resources, with recent discoveries made in Zimbabwe's Cabora Bassa Basin by Invictus Energy and Namibia's prolific Orange Basin by Shell, TotalEnergies and Galp. Namibia is also home to the development of sub-Saharan Africa's largest green hydrogen project led by Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, while Mauritania is pioneering green hydrogen through Chariot's Project Nour and CWP Global's AMAN Project, coupled with expanded gas development from the bp-operated Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG project.  Despite Africa's unmet energy requirements, global energy lending has only tightened, as major European and other Western banks exit the fossil fuels industry in Africa, while financing fossil fuels in Western countries. These institutions have not been equitable when it comes to facilitating adequate energy and climate finance for African countries, where local populations are disproportionately affected by both climate risks and restrictions on fossil fuel development. Europe has made repeated calls for natural gas and green finance, yet there is a considerable blockage on energy finance for African countries. This chokehold continues to inhibit Africa's industrial growth and the establishment of critical gas-driven industries like power, petrochemicals, fertilizers and mining, keeping the continent at a developmental lag.  We Africans deplore the continuous polarization of the energy dialogue in Western countries and call on the demonization of African oil and gas to stop. We urge free market solutions to Africa, and not a continuous push for aid so that Africans pledge to leave their resources in the ground. More aid is not the answer. Investment is key. From Cape to Cairo, from Nairobi to Dakar, we stand united toward meeting our shared obligations to fight climate change, noting that wealthy nations need to decarbonize and Africa needs to industrialize.  It is the position of African civil society, human rights groups, environmental groups, governments and the private sector that African countries must diversify available pools of capital and create financial instruments outside of traditional institutions - tapping into private equity and non-conventional bonds - to fund new exploration and energy initiatives. Moreover, African countries must put in place attractive regulatory and fiscal terms, thereby creating an enabling environment and removing all barriers to investment, such as incohesive regulation, excessive red tape or nationalistic policies. With competitive terms and incentives in place - followed by the integration of ESG principles and capacity building requirements - African energy projects will be able to compete effectively for global capital and work toward making energy poverty history across the continent.

According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), a total of 2180 climate-related cases were filed as of December 2022, compared to 884 cases in 2017. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although by far most of them have been brought in the US, climate litigation is picking up worldwide. Cases in the global south amount to 5.2 % of the total number, while international and regional cases represent 5.8 % (UNEP 2023).</p><p>This text deals with lawsuits filed against states in various countries. However, companies are being sued for climate-damaging behaviour too.</p><p>1. Young plaintiffs challenge European governments: It was one of last year's most prominent court hearings: six Portuguese claimants aged from 11 to 24 challenged the inaction of 33 European governments on the climate crisis before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). According to the plaintiffs, this is a battle for their very right to life and family life, protected by Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>The case is pending. It can be considered as one of the world's largest climate legal actions where claimants argue that extreme weather events, rising temperatures and disrupted ecosystems threaten their safety and very existence. They claim that inadequate climate action endangers their future, jeopardising their right to life. As they face an uncertain future burdened by a heating planet, they state that their right to a stable and predictable family life is violated too.</p><p>The case has ignited public debate about intergenerational equity and the urgency of climate action. If the plaintiffs are proved right, European governments might have to implement stricter emission-reduction policies and invest in cleaner infrastructure. The ripple effects could be felt globally, inspiring similar legal action and strengthening the link between climate action and human rights.</p><p>2. Taking the German government to court: In Germany, young climate activists have already successfully challenged the government's plans on climate action. They went before the country's Federal Constitutional Court which made headlines in 2021 when it ruled that parts of Germany's Federal Climate Protection Act were incompatible with basic human rights. </p><p>The judges pointed out that the legislation failed to protect future generations from the impacts of global heating and that it did not distribute the carbon budget fairly between current and future generations. The German government had to react, and it did so by tightening up the Federal Climate Protection Act.</p><p>In 2022, however, the plaintiffs went on to sue the German government before the ECHR. They argue that the country's climate policy remains inadequate.</p><p>3. Norwegian oil remains in the ground: Another example of a successful climate lawsuit comes from Norway, a major oil-producing nation. In January, the Oslo District Court invalidated three permits for new offshore oil and gas fields issued by the Norwegian government. The court ruled that the approval lacked sufficient environmental impact assessments. Greenpeace and Natur og Ungdom (Young Friends of the Earth Norway), a youth NGO, had taken the Norwegian government to court. The fields hold a combined 875 million barrels of oil equivalent.</p><p>The court emphasised that it is necessary to assess future emissions during the approval process to ensure transparency and democratic participation. Norway's Energy Minister, Terje Aasland, said the government disagrees with the judgment and may appeal.</p><p>4. Court rules in favour of activists in Montana: On the other side of the Atlantic, 16 young activists from the American state of Montana filed a lawsuit against their state in 2020 demanding their right to a clean and healthy environment. In August 2023, a Montana state court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, stating they had proven that as children and youth, they are disproportionately harmed by fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts.</p><p>The case revolved around a clause within the Montana Environmental Policy Act, which prohibits officials from considering climate impacts when deciding on new energy projects. The claimants highlighted the harmful effects of fossil fuels on Montana's ecosystem and public health as well as the connection between fossil fuel extraction and a diminished future for Montana's youth.</p><p>It was the first time a US court held the government responsible for breaching the constitution based on climate change. The ruling mandated Montana to consider climate change impacts before approving any new fossil fuel projects. The state is challenging the decision in the Montana Supreme Court, which in January refused to pause the state court's ruling. Government officials are doubtful about the practical consequences of the ruling.</p><p>5. Kenyan communities want to hold government accountable: Another landmark legal battle, one of the first of its kind in Africa, is being fought in Kenya by a group of 66 local residents and Kituo Cha Sheria, an advocacy group. On behalf of their community, they seek compensation for the government's alleged failure to develop policies and take necessary measures to respond to the climate crisis. </p><p>The Environment and Lands Court in Kabarnet, Kenya, is deliberating whether the government can be held accountable for climate change-induced displacement and property loss suffered by residents in the Rift Valley.</p><p>The residents were displaced in 2020, when Lake Baringo, one of the country's largest freshwater lakes, reached unprecedented heights and flooded crucial areas. They claim that the inundation exposed them to increased risk of water-borne diseases including malaria, cholera and typhoid as well as attacks by crocodiles and hippos.</p><p>The plaintiffs and their communities argue that the surge in water levels was caused by heightened rainfall and increased inflows from rivers as a result of global warming. This view is supported by a government task force that investigated the situation. It attributed the cause of the rising waters to climate change. In view of the claimants, the government either failed or refused to implement crucial adaptation strategies including early flood warning systems.</p><p>The court's judgement will determine the government's liability for climate-related damages. Even more importantly, it will also address the issue of compensating individuals adversely affected by environmental calamities. The case is expected to set a significant legal precedent in the intersection of climate change, government accountability and citizen compensation in Africa.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 8, "title": "Landmark climate hearings conclude at world's top court", "published": "2024-12-13", "bodyText": "<p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Experts and environmentalists warn that this shift could put Germany's ambitious green transition at risk.  BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - As Germany prepares for elections on February 23, a striking shift has emerged: climate action, a defining issue in the last national vote just over three years ago, has nearly disappeared from the campaign discourse this time.  Polls indicate that German voters are divided on climate policy. A recent survey by Climate Alliance Germany, a climate justice advocacy group, found that 53% of voters want the next government to do more to protect the environment.  However, other polls suggest that climate action ranks only fourth among voter priorities, behind migration, economic stability and security concerns.  Migration is a dominant issue as some regions feel the strain on the asylum system due to the amount of irregular arrivals, fuelling intense national debate. At the same time, economic worries - driven by inflation and high energy costs - have shifted public focus to the cost of living and job security.  Additionally, security concerns stemming from the ongoing Ukraine war and debates over defence spending have further dominated the political agenda.  Critics say the silence on climate issues on the campaign trail has been deafening.  Stefanie Langkamp, climate policy director at umbrella group Climate Alliance, said: \"The challenges of climate protection remain enormous, but the parties remain silent on the matter - or advocate regression.\"  Germany's green transition at risk?  Germany's green transition, or \"Energiewende,\" is considered one of the world's most ambitious national shifts from fossil fuels and nuclear power to renewable sources.  In 2024, roughly 58% of the country's electricity generation came from renewables - wind, solar, biomass and hydropower - up from about 40% in 2021 and about 6% in 2000, according to official figures.  Data from the intergovernmental International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows that Germany ranks fifth globally in installed solar capacity and third in wind energy capacity.  However, Germany's transition efforts are also being used as a cautionary tale in some circles.  A recent study published by US-based think tank Baker Institute points to Germany's \"Energiewende\" warning that \"misguided energy policies can have far-reaching implications.\"  \"Germany's recent efforts to implement bold renewable energy policies risk undermining its long-standing position as a European economic powerhouse and global leader in manufacturing,\" it stated.  \"By prioritizing energy transition speed over economic stability, Germany's new energy policy includes many missteps, such as relying heavily on Russia to supply natural gas [and] shutting down all nuclear plants, among others,\" it reported.  Conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz, the frontrunner to become Germany's next chancellor, has framed the election as a \"referendum on failed green economic policies,\" slamming Economy Minister Robert Habeck, a Green, for his \"disastrous economic and energy policy.\"  Scholz's climate legacy  With the Greens poised to exit government, according to recent polls, environmentalists are concerned that ambitious climate policies pursued under the current centre-left coalition could now be at risk.  The government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz is credited with expanding renewable energy sources and successfully phasing out nuclear power by the end of 2023, all while maintaining energy stability amid economic and security crises.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine further forced Germany to rapidly reduce its reliance on Russian gas, prompting an urgent diversification of energy supplies.  In 2023, the government amended the Climate Action Act - intended as a cornerstone of Germany's climate policy - accelerating the carbon neutrality goal to 2045 and raising its 2030 emissions reduction target to 65%, with coal set to be phased out by 2038.  However, a controversial heating law mandating the phaseout of fossil fuel heating systems in some buildings triggered widespread public backlash and partly led to the implosion of Scholz's coalition.  Cutting through election noise  Climate policy has not been completely sidelined from the current election campaign. However, observers note the discourse has been polarized rather than productive.  Speaking at an Alternative for Germany (AfD) party conference, the far-right party's top candidate, Alice Weidel, said to great applause: \"When we are at the helm, we will tear down all wind turbines. Down with these windmills of shame.\" She has also called for bringing back nuclear power.    Berlin-based energy economist Claudia Kemfert, however, said that \"due to the high costs of nuclear energy, it is unlikely to be reintroduced.\"   Reviving nuclear power would require significant subsidies, legal amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and a solution for nuclear waste storage, Kemfert told dpa.  Demolishing wind turbines, meanwhile would \"significantly jeopardize security of supply, as wind energy now accounts for over 20% of electricity generation in Germany,\" Kemfert said.  What lies ahead?  Following Germany's February 23 election, the country is likely to end up with a conservative-led government, with Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats widely seen as the most probable junior coalition partner.  The conservative CDU/CSU bloc has pledged to overturn the EU's planned ban on new combustion engine vehicle sales starting in 2035 - a regulation designed to push the transport sector toward carbon neutrality by 2050.  However, experts warn that rolling back such climate policies could destabilize industries, slow the energy transition and expose Germany to EU penalties for failing to meet emissions targets.  \"The automotive industry needs policy stability, as the market is already shifting to electric vehicles,\" Kemfert said.   Beyond industry concerns, \"one of the biggest challenges for the next federal government is social justice,\" she added.  Public transportation should be strengthened and made affordable, while climate policies must not disproportionately burden low-income earners, according to Kemfert.  Meanwhile, WWF Germany climate expert Viviane Raddatz warns: \"Anything we don't invest today will have to be spent twice or three times as much on climate-related costs tomorrow.\"   Copyright dpa    </p>", "publisher": "dpa-AFX International ProFeed", "instances": ["By Marissa Smart, dpa   Once a top priority, climate action has faded to the background in Germany's upcoming elections as migration, economic stability and security take centre stage.

Berlin-based energy economist Claudia Kemfert, however, said that \"due to the high costs of nuclear energy, it is unlikely to be reintroduced.\"   Reviving nuclear power would require significant subsidies, legal amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and a solution for nuclear waste storage, Kemfert told dpa.  Demolishing wind turbines, meanwhile would \"significantly jeopardize security of supply, as wind energy now accounts for over 20% of electricity generation in Germany,\" Kemfert said.  What lies ahead?  Following Germany's February 23 election, the country is likely to end up with a conservative-led government, with Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats widely seen as the most probable junior coalition partner.  The conservative CDU/CSU bloc has pledged to overturn the EU's planned ban on new combustion engine vehicle sales starting in 2035 - a regulation designed to push the transport sector toward carbon neutrality by 2050.  However, experts warn that rolling back such climate policies could destabilize industries, slow the energy transition and expose Germany to EU penalties for failing to meet emissions targets.  \"The automotive industry needs policy stability, as the market is already shifting to electric vehicles,\" Kemfert said.   Beyond industry concerns, \"one of the biggest challenges for the next federal government is social justice,\" she added.  Public transportation should be strengthened and made affordable, while climate policies must not disproportionately burden low-income earners, according to Kemfert.  Meanwhile, WWF Germany climate expert Viviane Raddatz warns: \"Anything we don't invest today will have to be spent twice or three times as much on climate-related costs tomorrow.\"   Copyright dpa    </p>", "publisher": "dpa-AFX International ProFeed", "instances": ["By Marissa Smart, dpa   Once a top priority, climate action has faded to the background in Germany's upcoming elections as migration, economic stability and security take centre stage. Experts and environmentalists warn that this shift could put Germany's ambitious green transition at risk. BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - As Germany prepares for elections on February 23, a striking shift has emerged: climate action, a defining issue in the last national vote just over three years ago, has nearly disappeared from the campaign discourse this time. Polls indicate that German voters are divided on climate policy. A recent survey by Climate Alliance Germany, a climate justice advocacy group, found that 53% of voters want the next government to do more to protect the environment. However, other polls suggest that climate action ranks only fourth among voter priorities, behind migration, economic stability and security concerns. Migration is a dominant issue as some regions feel the strain on the asylum system due to the amount of irregular arrivals, fuelling intense national debate. At the same time, economic worries - driven by inflation and high energy costs - have shifted public focus to the cost of living and job security. Additionally, security concerns stemming from the ongoing Ukraine war and debates over defence spending have further dominated the political agenda. Critics say the silence on climate issues on the campaign trail has been deafening."]}, {"relevance_score": 34, "title": "Social disparities thwart climate justice", "published": "2023-02-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Global heating is extremely unfair.

What was your experience of the situation there?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At that time, the Petersberg Agreement of 2001 was in force, which structured the political transition after the fall of the first Taliban regime. There were positive developments for women's rights, and schools for girls were reopened. These successes encouraged us feminists to throw ourselves into our work. Unfortunately, history is repeating itself and another generation of Afghan women is now facing a Taliban regime - and once again organising underground schools for girls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How did the women's-rights movement use that period of new freedoms?</p><p>Under pressure from the United Nations (UN), the first democratic government of Afghanistan had to ratify many international agreements, including CEDAW, the UN women's-rights convention. At least 25 % of seats in Parliament now had to be filled by women. Civil-society organisations (NGOs) launched clever campaigns in order to ensure that women's issues were brought into politics. For example, my colleagues at medica mondiale Afghanistan brought candidates a list of demands that they wanted them to include in their political agendas. In return, the women's-rights activists promised the candidates hundreds of votes from their respective clans. This idea was later adopted with great enthusiasm by medica mondiale colleagues in Kosovo. It allowed them to skilfully use the prevailing clan structure to promote women's rights. I first encountered this approach in my own Muslim migrant worker family. Whenever possible, we used social and religious beliefs to fight for our own rights and freedoms.</p><p>A lot changed in Afghanistan during that time. What, specifically, were women's-rights activists able to achieve?</p><p>Legislation to protect women from violence and discrimination was promoted. These initiatives were supported by influential Afghan and international feminists who often worked for large institutions like the UN, the European Union (EU) and national delegations. They built strong alliances. The combined pressure from Afghan and international women's-rights activists led to the passage of a law to fight violence against women in 2009, for example. There were other successes relating to healthcare. Afghanistan's maternal mortality rate is the second highest in the world. When I started working for medica mondiale in 2003, I was impressed by the Afghan women doctors and former Taliban opponents who went back to Afghanistan with us after the fall of the regime to offer their expertise in hospitals. They taught medical personnel how to recognise gender-specific trauma. Later they built a system to document violations of the human rights of women hospital patients. I used this data to create political pressure and sent it to the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women. And still these projects achieved much more than was recorded in the evaluations.</p><p>What exactly do you mean? What else did the international projects achieve?</p><p>Working together for women's rights changed us all: I saw how strong women can be in the most terrible situations and how skilfully they negotiate when faced with hardliners in ministries, families, the military and prisons. They only needed solidarity and support from the outside to exercise their power. The everyday lives of my Afghan colleagues changed too. Thanks to their work for Afghan and international non-governmental organisations, for the UN or the Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), they earned their own money and could contribute to household decisions. They drove cars on their own and went on business trips; some studied alongside their work. When their spouses travelled for work, they could sleep at home instead of having to stay with their mothers-in-law. It was difficult for some of our women lawyers to defend clients in court who had been arrested, along with their children, for supposedly committing adultery. The society considered the accused, as well as their defenders, bad people. But attitudes were changing.</p><p>And then international troops withdrew from Afghanistan.</p><p>The air went out of women's lungs on 15 August 2021, the day they were banished once again to hearth and home. Today, when I look back on 20 years of international presence in Afghanistan, I see an international breach of trust with the Afghans. The Enquete Commission's final report on Germany's mission in Afghanistan called progress on women's rights and the establishment of a civil society 'partial successes' while declaring the entire Afghanistan mission a failure.</p><p>Since the Taliban took power in 2021, women's rights have once again been massively restricted. How are women there nevertheless trying to create freedoms for themselves or protest against the situation today?</p><p>Nowadays activists are risking their lives to defend themselves against the misogynistic laws of the Taliban. Given the fact that women have been banished from public life and the workforce, it's good that we now have social media. There women can share demands, provide information about human-rights violations and mobilise support from abroad. Online platforms offer a certain amount of protection. They make it possible, despite access restrictions, to draw international attention to events in Afghanistan and document them in order to someday bring perpetrators before national courts and the International Court of Justice. Women are also defending themselves against the ignorance of western decision-makers, who were mobilising the military and defending human, women's and girls' rights just a few years ago, but now are silent and looking the other way. During the government negotiations with the Taliban in Doha, education for girls was the only red line the western negotiators, including the Germans, drew. And now even that red line no longer exists.</p><p>How are aid organisations and activists reacting to this situation?</p><p>In December 2024, the Taliban's latest attempt to restrict the activities of NGOs became public. The UN Security Council discovered that the efforts of more and more Afghan women humanitarian aid workers were being hampered. Yet their work is key for survival in the current humanitarian crisis. The one silver lining is the division within the Taliban regarding the interpretation of Islam. Some reject schooling for girls after age 12 and insist that they stay home, marry and become housewives and mothers. Others would actually let them study, though separately from men. Both groups are basing their views on Islam. Latching onto these contradictions is the only opportunity right now for international aid organisations and local activists to negotiate rights for women and girls.</p><p>What needs to happen in order for civil society to be able to continue this work?</p><p>For years we have needed more money for feminist movements, more women UN peacekeepers, women and BIPOC diplomats and a serious effort to reduce poverty as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We need more gender mainstreaming and representation of women in the security sector, including in UN peacekeeping missions and the European Union's military and civilian missions. We need penalties for sexualised violence in such missions and a refugee law that protects women and children from gender-based violence. People have been aware of the problem for some time, but institutions have been unwilling to change, and reforms have also faced patriarchal-nationalistic backlash in many countries. The consequences of not fully implementing these goals can be seen in the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement in Iran.</p><p>After the death of 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022, thousands took to the streets in Iran. From a German perspective, what should have happened differently?</p><p>Despite its professedly feminist foreign policy, the German government has let down Iran's courageous civil society. Germany has said nothing in response to the current wave of executions. The main argument for realpolitik is always economic and security interests - in this case, the much sought-after regional stability.

Instead, you advocate the concept of 'strong green growth'. Can you explain the idea behind it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First of all, we need to understand the differences between degrowth and green growth. I have some sympathy for degrowth because the concept conveys that we need to be wary of capitalist economic growth and more mindful to protect natural resources. The problem is that degrowth focuses too much on reducing economic growth, while a large proportion of Africans need significant economic growth to live a meaningful life that meets their basic needs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I understand the concern of some that green growth can be used as a ruse for 'business as usual'. However, this is not necessarily the case, as there are different versions of green growth. The strong version of green economy that I support is one that allows a focus on innovation and a decoupling of economic growth from environmental impacts. At the same time, however, it achieves a certain level of economic growth that is necessary for the well-being of the majority of Africans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To be clear: I do not support green growth that does not care about justice. Examples of such an approach include flooding Africa with cheap and unreliable solar products or displacing communities for renewable energy-projects.</p><p>I also do not support unrestrained economic growth with all its consequences for the environment and climate change. But I do not believe that a reduction in growth by itself is the solution. I advocate a strong version of green growth that allows for some growth, especially in developing countries.</p><p>You write that degrowth could exacerbate poverty in low-income countries. How could this dynamic unfold in Africa?</p><p>We need more growth to feed the African population in the first place. In 2024, around 429 million people in Africa were living in extreme poverty. There are also indications that we will have up to 105 million climate refugees from Africa by 2050. So how is Africa supposed to feed its population, protect the environment, provide electricity, running water and efficient hospitals, build or equip universities and other facilities for research and innovation if the economy is not allowed to grow?</p><p>Some degrowth scholars say that we can perhaps let Africa grow but restrict growth in richer countries. That may sound nice in theory, but in practice it will be very difficult because we live in a globalised world. So, if rich countries start to focus on cutting growth, where will Africa be able to sell its raw materials to get the revenue needed to invest in development?</p><p>The reality is that we are seeing a trend towards populist movements in the west. Many far-right parties are already in government. This also means that countries are looking inwards again - with the result that solidarity is taking a back seat and nationalism is on the rise. So, we are a long way from a real debate about degrowth in these countries anyway, and Africa will be negatively affected in any scenario.</p><p>Is it likely that degrowth will also increase social inequalities in high-income countries?</p><p>Some scientists assume that there will be more equality once there is degrowth. But this is not true. Just as in a global degrowth scenario - where Africa, as the currently marginalised continent, would suffer more - those who are already poorer in high-income countries will bear the burden. It is important to understand that degrowth or growth scenarios are completely different from distribution and redistribution policies. Unless you introduce strong policies and institutions to ensure the redistribution of resources and income in a country like Germany, it is not enough to degrow the German economy to eliminate inequality. Because the rich have a head start, and they will always get their way.</p><p>How could a strong green-growth model look like in practice for African nations?</p><p>Many African countries do not contribute much to climate change. With per capita carbon emissions of 0.12 tons last year, it takes the average Rwandan 129 years to emit the same amount of carbon as the average American - with per capita CO2 emissions of 15.52 tons - does in one year.</p><p>However, we have to accept that, given the population size of African countries, it would be a disaster for the environment if Africa were to follow the same economic growth model as western countries.</p><p>Strong green growth in Africa would aim to minimise the impact on ecosystems and ensure, for example, that our cities are designed in such a way that there are safe bicycle and pedestrian paths and electric vehicles on public transport.</p><p>In a strong green-growth scenario, a large proportion of Africans would have to generate their electricity from renewable sources. Africa has all the prerequisites to do this, for example through wind and solar energy. Some African countries already obtain a large part of their energy resources in this way, but there is still the problem of a low innovation base and the inability to produce more renewable energy-technologies.</p><p>Whose fault is that?</p><p>This is one of the many areas in which the rich countries have let the African countries down. The former are content to export green technologies to Africa as finished products and make Africa the market for these products instead of promoting innovation and knowledge transfer. In this way, they maintain an economic competitive advantage over Africa. Some have referred to this as 'green colonisation'.</p><p>What we need for strong green growth are strong partnerships. And Europe and the west in general need to understand that this is also in their own interest. If the west does not enter into strategic partnerships with Africa that enables African governments to improve their position in the value chain and produce some of these products, it will have negative consequences, especially for Europe:</p><p>Unemployment in Africa will continue to rise and the small boats crossing the Mediterranean will become bigger boats.</p><p>China will gain a stronger foothold in Africa through strategic relationships and overtake Europe.</p><p>What safeguards would you propose to ensure that green growth strategies in Africa genuinely promote sustainability and equity?</p><p>It comes down to institutions and science - reporting, monitoring and evaluation. We need a sound natural capital accounting system that really ensures that natural resource use is properly accounted for. We need appropriate pricing of goods that reflects the environmental impact of processes and products. We need transparency in government reporting on water use, pollution, CO2 emissions, et cetera. And we need strong civil societies to keep governments in check.</p><p>Your paper emphasises the role of climate justice in evaluating growth models. How can African nations better advocate for equitable climate policies on the international stage?</p><p>There needs to be more respect. Many feel that Africa is still being patronised. It has taken so many years for Africa to get even one seat in the G20. In addition, commitments must be followed by action. Western countries talk about Africa being a valuable partner in international development. But they still give loans instead of grants and refuse to restructure the international financial architecture so that African countries can get money at the same interest rates as rich countries.</p><p>But at the same time, I have to say that many African countries also need to wake up and work on their attitude. Their leaders need to show seriousness - and to do this they should not just come to international negotiations and then moan that they are the victims but show themselves to be serious reformers.</p><p>Africa is a continent of 54 nations. How can policymakers ensure that growth strategies account for the continent's diverse economic, social and environmental contexts?</p><p>Strategies must be based on a set of principles, and each country must then shape them according to its current situation, natural resource base and economic conditions.</p><p>Regional organisations such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and ECOWAS can also play an important role here by establishing guidelines that apply to their respective regions.</p><p>In your opinion, what role do indigenous African knowledge and local practices play in shaping sustainable and equitable growth models?</p><p>Quite a big one, but only if they are recognised, supported, nurtured and harnessed. There is not much investment or effort here.</p><p>My father built his house in Nigeria's Igboland with clay, as his forefathers did. This is a climate-friendly form of a cooling system. So why can't we think of new ways for builders in modern Nigeria to resort to this practice and do away with cement, which emits a huge amount of CO2 during processing?</p><p>There is not enough talk about how we can really benefit from such centuries-old practices. African governments are also called to action in this area. They need to recognise that there are already many technologies that enable strong green growth - they just need to be used.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["It comes down to institutions and science - reporting, monitoring and evaluation.

These natural resources are needed in environmentally sustainable technology. Examples include solar power, electric vehicles and green hydrogen. According to research done by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, Africa holds 30 % of the world's mineral reserves. To meet the expected rise in global demand, production of minerals and metals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt must increase by nearly 500 % by 2050. Such growth is impossible without Africa's resources. However, history shows that resource extraction in Africa has been detrimental to communities as they are left poor, their landscapes are destroyed and some areas become war zones. Related problems were not tackled in Nairobi.</p><p>The Nairobi Declaration, which was adopted by the summit, is not useless, however. It will shape Africa's position in Dubai and highlights important issues, including reforms of the international financial architecture. It even proposes a global carbon tax. These issues are important because the current global system is indeed putting Africa at a disadvantage. Moreover, the goal to triple Africa's renewable energy capacity by the end of this decade makes sense too. It is needed to improve the lot of marginalised communities and can contribute to unlocking sustainable energy supply globally.</p><p>However, more must happen to empower poor people, as the young generation is demanding. Ahead of the official summit, we convened the Africa Youth Climate Assembly with over 600 delegates from across Africa.

Unfortunately, they do not rise to the huge challenges before us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The science is absolutely clear. The escalating climate crisis means that humanity is heading for disaster. One after another, the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have pointed this out. The outlook is becoming ever more frightening. In number six, the picture remained bleak even in the most optimistic scenarios. It is truly amazing that these reports, which are based on historically unprecedented efforts to compile all relevant studies internationally, have not triggered credible and effective responses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Policymakers clearly know what is at stake, not least due to the annual UN climate summits. The recent Glasgow summit, delayed by one year because of Covid-19, was attended by almost 200 countries. Mass media reported what risks we face and what needs to be done. Nonetheless, we still lack credible and effective responses. 'Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread,' said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his closing remarks and added: 'It is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Occultist market orthodoxy</p><p>Extremely powerful forces are at work. Those who benefit from fossil capitalism are pushing humanity towards the abyss. Corporate investors prioritise profits, not the common good, while market-orthodox ideology disparages state action. Governments in the global north and south, whether elected or not, seem enthralled by a kind of occultist cult that praises the private sector.</p><p>The real challenge is to steer economic activity onto an environmentally sustainable trajectory. This will require decisive action, and setting market incentives will simply not be enough. Nonetheless, multilateral debate largely sticks to economic paradigms that confront or question corporate power and shy away from regulating it stringently.</p><p>At the same time, corporate rhetoric has been changing. For example, the finance-sector giant Black Rock has been demanding more government spending on climate protection. Moreover, many multinationals have adopted some kind of sustainability programme. None of this means much because we lack criteria to detect green washing.</p><p>What we need is a transformation of the global economy, but what companies offer is well-designed PR plus new business models, some of which may actually do some good, some of which are designed to attract subsidies and some of which may even prove harmful. To only mention one snag: Many companies promise to offset greenhouse-gas emissions by planting trees. That may work out for a single enterprise, but not all can do so. There simply is not enough land for the large-scale global afforestation that would be required.</p><p>Green deals</p><p>More must happen than is currently on policymakers' agenda. There is a trend to draft green deals, and documents of this kind are proliferating. The bad news is that they are not up to task.</p><p>The general idea is to follow the example of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It relied on massive government spending to generate employment, create infrastructure and offer new opportunities to masses of people, ending the Great Depression of the 1930. Today's green-deal proposals often link escaping the Covid-19 slump to environmentally needed investments and greater social justice.</p><p>Unfortunately, the green deals tend to stay unconvincing. US President Joe Biden's Green New Deal is stuck in the Senate (see Katie Cashman on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>), and even if it were implemented, it would not suffice to make the US environmentally sustainable. The EU, in the context of its European Green Deal, has recently accepted nuclear energy and natural gas as 'sustainable' options, even though the first causes unmanageable radioactive waste and the latter is a fossil fuel. Observers from less fortunate world regions notice that those who claim to be global leaders struggle to wean their own nations off excessive resource consumption.</p><p>It is disturbing, moreover, that green deals tend to be embedded in orthodox economics. They fail to question the accumulative greed of capitalism, which is the biggest cause of environmental destruction. Too many authors do not take into account that unlimited growth is impossible on a planet with limited resources. Instead, green deals rely on green bonds, carbon credits and similar tools to create new options for capital accumulation. Infantile faith in market mechanisms is de-politicising and de-historicising global discourse.</p><p>Not all green-deals proposals are the same. Some include progressive ideas for promoting social justice and reducing inequality. Sensible visions of democratic eco-socialism are geared to tackling environmental and socio-economic challenges at once. Authors such as Max Ajl (2021a, 2021b), John Bellamy Foster (2020) and Tom Perez (2021) have done good work in terms of assessing things.</p><p>Glaring inequality, worsened by growing environmental hazards</p><p>It cannot be disputed that humanity needs global policies in response both to glaring inequality and worsening environmental hazards. A serious global green deal in pursuit of social and ecological justice would be good. Unfortunately, we lack the kind of global-governance system that might conceive, adopt and implement it. What we have are many different multilateral institutions with different agendas and different shareholding patterns. Most of them fail to deliver the results we need.</p><p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is a striking example. The international community adopted it unanimously three decades ago. The annual climate summits are supposed to improve and implement it. Yes, we have undeniably seen some incremental progress, but the big picture is that the climate crisis has kept escalating. It will soon spin out of control. In spite of the UNFCCC, we are heading towards eco-cide and bio-cide.</p><p>Climate justice is needed at the global level. So far, low-income countries - and especially the poor communities who live there - have felt the worst impacts of global heating. By contrast, the high-income countries, which have emitted by far the most greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution, are better placed to adapt to a changing environment. Compounding global justice problems, high-income countries wield disproportionate power in multilateral settings, but regularly fail to fulfil their promises (see Saleemul Huq on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>To keep average temperature increases below 1.5\u00b0Celsius, humanity must accept a finite carbon budget. Approximately 70?% of it has been gobbled up by a handful of countries in the global north. China has recently joined the list of big guzzlers. What about the 70?% of the world population who live in other countries - most in the global south - and are largely deprived of material progress?</p><p>Phasing down versus phasing out</p><p>The insistence of India's government to keep on using coal must be seen in this context. This step has attracted considerable criticism because it made sure that the final statement in Glasgow only called for 'phasing down' coal rather than phasing it 'out'. There is much to dislike about Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is not a champion of social justice. At the domestic level, his policies tend to serve Hindu majoritarianism and exclude minorities. Nonetheless, his government's stance in Glasgow regarding coal made sense. Low and lower-middle income countries must not be made to bear the main brunt of mitigating the climate crisis. If the EU thinks it still needs gas, India will certainly still need coal.</p><p>The challenges are complex and huge. It is impossible to fully assess them in a short essay as this one. It is obvious, however, that we need decisive action and that technocratic market interventions cannot suffice. Harmful patterns of production and consumption must be banned. At the same time, disadvantaged communities must not be left even further behind. We need ecological and social justice.</p><p>People around the world are indeed rising up in big and small movements. They want to fight for social justice and against environmental destruction. The climate strikes that were initiated by Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager, proved that climate worries resonate all over the world. Such activism inspires hope. Doomsday fatalism will not help us. At the same time, eco-activism has not brought about the change needed. Thunberg had a point when she summed up the Glasgow climate summit as yet more 'blah blah blah'.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["The international community adopted it unanimously three decades ago.

Africa is disproportionately bearing the brunt of climate change, with 17 out of the 20 countries most threatened by climate impacts located on the continent. Recent severe weather events, including severe droughts ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo-opa.co/3YrV2Bd\">https://apo-opa.co/3YrV2Bd</url>) in Southern Africa and heavy rains ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo-opa.co/3Sdb26a\">https://apo-opa.co/3Sdb26a</url>) in Tanzania, Kenya, and Burundi have caused food shortages, fatalities, and displacement. Despite these alarming trends, plans to expand fossil fuel infrastructure, like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), continue to threaten both people and the planet.  The REPower Afrika campaign showcases the power and potential of community-led efforts igniting a renewable energy movement across the continent. Communities are standing up against harmful fossil fuels and demonstrating that renewable energy is a viable, equitable alternative. These efforts are fuelling hope for an energy-secure future and freedom from worsening climate impacts.  Urgent Call for Renewable Energy Investment and Policy Support  For Africa to realize a just transition to renewable energy, significant investment from financial institutions and developed nations is essential and urgent. African governments must create an enabling framework, enacting policies and regulations that facilitate the deployment of renewable energy and attract substantial investments.  Renewable energy is not only a sustainable choice but also a driver of economic development. While fossil fuel projects like EACOP are projected to create 200-300 jobs in Uganda, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) ( <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.IRENA.org\">www.IRENA.org</url>) projects that renewable energy could generate 400,000 to 1.5 million jobs in East Africa by 2050.  Through the REPower Afrika campaign, communities in the EACOP region (Uganda and Tanzania) are showcasing the potential of renewable energy. Solar installations in communities along the EACOP pipeline are improving people's lives, providing light for children to study but also developing green jobs and enhanced energy access whilst protecting the environment.  REPower Afrika is advocating for a future where renewable energy powers our communities, protects our environment, and promotes social and economic well-being. Ten (10) gatherings will be taking place across Uganda and Tanzania, with solidarity actions taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria.    * Protests areas in Uganda: Hoima, Kikkube, Kakumiro    * Protests areas in Tanzania: Missenyi, Nzega, Tanga,  Quotes  \"REPower Afrika marks the beginning of a transformative journey where communities at the frontline of the climate crisis take the lead in demanding accessible, affordable, and safe energy for all while creating millions of green jobs.

It's time to expose the super-rich and the most polluting industries and tax their billions. The money generated by a global wealth tax could help drive forward the renewable energy transition with the kinds of community-driven projects REPower Afrika is putting center stage.?

Yet the sound of the relentless rain that devastated the country and the scenes of desperate people fleeing for their lives still haunt us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Social structures remain fractured. Many people are homeless and living in poverty. And while Malawi is still struggling with the effects of the cyclone, droughts are bringing new challenges. Cyclone Freddy was a stark warning of what is to come - more frequent and ferocious disasters driven by climate change.</p><p>The food supply is already inadequate: for many people, going to bed hungry has become the norm. Malawi cannot cope with this burden.</p><p>Women and girls have suffered the most from the cyclone's impact. Existing inequalities were exacerbated. Women in Malawi face heightened risks of violence, exploitation and a lack of access to essential healthcare, including sexual and reproductive health services.</p><p>Child marriages and prostitution</p><p>While boys returned to school, many girls remain stranded in emergency shelters and are less likely to resume their education in the future. The catastrophe has destabilised entire communities and fuelled a rise in harmful practices likes child marriage. Those who have lost their families have little choice than to resort to transactional sex for basic necessities.</p><p>The emergency has also made basic health services inaccessible for many. Roads and bridges have been washed away. While healthcare workers did come to the camps, overcrowding and lack of privacy and individualised care make the situation more difficult. This applies in particular to gynaecological treatments, but also concerns the supply of contraceptives, for example.</p><p>One woman I met, a 25-year-old mother of two, was struggling to afford life-saving medication for her baby who was injured by a collapsing wall during the cyclone. I also spoke to a young HIV-infected girl who was moved back and forth between two camps, losing access to the medication she desperately needed.</p><p>Climate change and gender</p><p>The crisis emphasises an important fact: in the face of climate change, resilience and the strengthening of healthcare are crucial. In terms of feminist development policy, this must include sexual and reproductive health. Governments around the world must ensure that they can provide protection for women and girls when the next disaster strikes.</p><p>The disaster furthermore highlights why we need to accelerate the climate-justice agenda and ensure that the countries with the lowest carbon emissions do not bear the highest costs and consequences for people. This is why we need continuous and coordinated support from strong partners such as Germany and other industrialised nations.</p><p>Children and young people make up more than half of Malawi's population. Their active participation in the search for long-term solutions is therefore essential. The same applies to the involvement of women.</p><p>My organisation 'ALL for Youth' is supported by the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) and is working in Malawi to close gaps here, among other things. The GFF, a country-led partnership hosted at the World Bank, supports 36 low- and middle-income countries in strengthening their health systems and promoting the health and rights of women and young people through more targeted measures and financing as well as political reforms.</p><p>Together with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Netherlands and the World Bank, Germany is hosting the current GFF replenishment campaign. The aim of this campaign is to mobilise funds to provide 250 million women, children and young people with access to health services.</p><p>We now have the opportunity to learn the lessons of cyclone Freddy and build a more resilient and inclusive future. Only by working together can we create a world where no woman or girl is left behind. Ultimately, our future depends on this.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 8, "title": "Pakistan: Bilawal Bhutto calls for climate justice, rejects Western pressure over Ukraine", "published": "2022-10-07", "bodyText": "<p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Environmental activists chanted and carried posters and banners that read \"Climate Justice Now\" as they marched through the conference premises.  Some protesters held large papier-m\\xE2ch\\xE9 frying pans containing inflatable models of the globe, showing the earth is being fried as temperatures rise. They carried posters saying, \"End fossil fuels\" and \"How many coffins for emissions reductions?\"  After nearly two weeks of talks, fears are growing as to whether the delegates gathered from almost 200 countries is can come to an agreement on the phase out planet-warming coal, oil and gas.   The EU and dozens of other countries are in favour, while oil-producing states openly oppose the aim.   Discussions are also focusing on whether the conference should decide to triple the amount of renewable energy by 2030 and double the pace of energy efficiency, meaning that appliances and goods should consume progressively less energy in their operation and production.  Officially, the talks are due to end on Tuesday but they often go into overtime.  The demonstration came after reports of a letter from the OPEC club of oil producing countries sparked outrage among many at the conference.  The letter, signed by OPEC Secretary General Haitham al-Ghais, reportedly calls for OPEC members to block ambitious resolutions on phasing out fossil fuels.   OPEC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Germany must fight hard for a global agreement on phasing out fossil fuels, the leader of GreenpeaceGermany told dpa.  \"The key question now is whether a binding decision to phase out fossil fuels will be made at the end of the conference,\" Martin Kaiser said.  He noted that Germany had aligned itself with the so-called High Ambition Coalition, a group of countries pushing for more binding commitments on climate change, but that Germany hadn't signed many of the group's declarations.  Kaiser said he expects German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock to negotiate intensely and not give in to China or oil-producing countries that are seeking to block or water down an agreement.  Earlier, Baerbock said that countries which rely heavily on oil and gas remain resistant to major efforts to combat climate change.  Baerbock said the struggle is about describing \"the way out of the fossil fuel world,\" in remarks in Dubai.  \"This is anything but easy,\" Baerbock said, as there are still countries that cling to the geopolitical importance and \"power politics\" of fossil fuels.  Germany's top diplomat said that her focus would be on campaigning for more climate action by countries that have grown wealthy from fossil fuels.   Industrialized countries such as Germany had shown that climate protection \"can also contribute to maintaining and strengthening\" the country's industrial base, Baerbock said.  A new fund to compensate poorer countries for the effects of climate change has created a \"foundation of trust\" for convincing other countries, Baerbock said.   Germany and the United Arab Emirates had pledged $100 million each to the fund at the start of the conference.   A total of $656 million had been raised for the fund by the beginning of the week, according to a blog post from the US environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).  The damage that has already been caused by climate-related extreme weather events is estimated to be many times higher, however.  German-US climate activist Jennifer Morgan, who is serving as the German Foreign Office's special envoy for climate policy, said that countries at the conference \"are now entering the critical phase of the negotiations.\"  \"I am concerned that not everyone is engaging constructively,\" Morgan acknowledged.  There was further concern after the news that next year's United Nations climate conference is to be held in Azerbaijan.   \"I am delighted to announce that there is overall support for Azerbaijan's candidature to host COP29,\" said Azerbaijan's environment minister, Mukhtar Babayev, at the plenary session.  The host country of the COP normally rotates among the five United Nations regional groups, namely the African Group, the Asia-Pacific Group, the Eastern Europe Group, the Latin American and Caribbean Group and the Western European and Others Group.  Russia welcomed the agreement on Azerbaijan.  However, environmental organization Germanwatch criticized the decision. \"The fact that Azerbaijan, after Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, is another oil state to lead the climate negotiations is highly problematic,\" said political director Christoph Bals.

This would only be possible if the world's biggest polluters lead the charge, he stressed, referring to the G20 countries, which are responsible for 80% of global CO2 emissions.  Industrialized countries must draw up a \"clear and credible roadmap\" for phasing out coal and must double their funding for climate adaptation, Guterres said.   The UN head said developed countries must achieve net-zero targets by 2040, while emerging economies should achieve these by 2050.  Leaders from across the continent have gathered in the Kenyan capital to discuss the transition to green energy and lay out priorities for the COP28 global climate conference later this year.  A push to turbocharge the renewable energy sector and ways to increase financing for climate protection and adaptation efforts is occupying most of the meeting.  This is the first time a climate summit has been held with Africa and its roughly 1.3 billion inhabitants as its primary focus. The three-day summit, which runs until Wednesday, brings together African heads of state, UN representatives, as well as public and private sector representatives from across the globe.  Guterres called for a \"course correction\" in the global financial system to accelerate climate finance while supporting sustainable development.  The world needs an effective debt relief mechanism based on a comprehensive global financial system, Guterres said, which supports payment suspensions as well as lower interest rates and loan maturities.   According to Organization One, African countries are more indebted than ever before. Currently, 21 countries on the continent are either bankrupt or in danger of sliding into a debt crisis.  Moussa Faki, Chair of the African Union Commission, also called for fairer climate financing. The continent suffers the most from the climate crisis but contributes the least to emissions, he stressed.  According to UN estimates, climate adaptation in Africa will cost between $30 billion and $50 billion annually. African countries would not be able to raise even half of that, Faki said.  Climate finance must be made available, accessible and affordable, said Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, President of COP28, due to take place in Dubai from 30 November.   He called for a well-organized and just transition towards renewable energy sources.  Pledging the European Union's support, European Commission Preisdent von der Leyen offered to be Africa's ally at COP28 so that \"Africa's priorities, as a continent that is most affected by climate change, are duly taken on board.\"  Setting out the partnership between Africa and the EU on climate action as a \"win-win,\" von der Leyen said Africa could help \"clean up the global energy system\" with plentiful critical raw materials and a young population.   Von der Leyen also underlined the importance of mobilizing private funding for the African economy to investment in the transition towards clean energy.   Through its Global Gateway initiative, the EU wants to mobilize around ?150 billion ($161 billion) for investments in Africa between 2021 and 2027.  African countries have contributed comparatively little to the climate crisis, but suffer disproportionately from its consequences.   The Horn of Africa is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years, while millions are also starving in the Sahel, which stretches from Senegal in the west to Djibouti in the east of the continent.

According to Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ), a climate change advocacy group organized by the company's employees, over 1,800 employees worldwide have committed to participating in a walkout, with 870 of them being based at the company's headquarters in Seattle.  A portion of the employees planning to participate in the walkout will convene at the Amazon Sphere, a four-story building located in downtown Seattle, while others will engage in the protest remotely during lunchtime.   AECJ claims that the company has been sluggish in tackling its contribution to climate change. It points out that Amazon's emissions usage rose by 40 percent following the announcement of the Climate Pledge agreement in 2019. The group insists that the company needs to take further action to achieve zero emissions by 2030.   According to a news release from AEJC, the urgency of the climate crisis is evident, and the walkout presents a valuable opportunity for employees to unite in solidarity and protect the remaining portions of our planet. By participating in the walkout, employees will join forces with fellow Amazon workers who are advocating for improved climate policies and addressing related concerns, with the shared belief that collective action can drive meaningful change within the company.  In response to the walkout, an Amazon spokesperson acknowledged that achieving net zero carbon will require time for the company. They emphasized the company's commitment to reaching net zero carbon by 2040, highlighting the involvement of more than 400 companies in their Climate Pledge initiative.   The spokesperson acknowledged the complexities associated with a company like Amazon, which has significant power consumption, transportation, packaging, and physical assets, but assured that they are diligently working towards their goal. They also affirmed the company's determination to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2025, expressing a commitment to substantial investment, innovation, and collaboration both internally and externally.   The walkout occurs one month after the implementation of a company policy that mandates employees to work from the office for three days every week.  In a memo sent by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in February, it was stated that the company made the decision to require employees to work from the office for three days a week based on observations of employee work patterns during the pandemic. The conclusion drawn from these observations was that employees are more actively involved and collaborative when working in person.  Furthermore, the walkout follows multiple rounds of layoffs by the company in the last few months, resulting in the elimination of 27,000 positions across various divisions such as advertising, human resources, gaming, stores, devices, and web services.

They have the responsibility to address the situation and assist those who are suffering disproportionately because of the impacts. Climate change is a result of industrialisation, so high-income countries with long industrial histories must assume responsibility. Poor countries lack the means to cope with global environmental change, so they deserve support. Rich nations, however, must not only support poorer ones, they also need to drastically reduce their carbon emissions. Currently, they are not changing their unsustainable lifestyles and exploitative economic system as they should.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is the perspective of indigenous peoples?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We indigenous peoples have the smallest carbon footprints. We live in areas where the impacts of global warming are felt, but we do not have the means to cope with the rapid changes that are happening. In the past, we could adapt because things happened slowly. Now change has become fast, drastic and largely unpredictable.</p><p>To what extent are your voices heard in global debate?</p><p>We are making ourselves heard in climate talks but our rights and well-being are not fully addressed. We can make significant contributions, especially in regard to our knowledge and practices of sustainability. How we think about resources matters. We consider them valuable not only because they serve our present needs, but just as much because future generations will need them too. Therefore, we manage - and conserve - them diligently. Accordingly, a large share of the Earth's remaining biodiversity is found on indigenous peoples' territories. Indigenous communities focus on the common good, not individual interests.</p><p>Do you want that to be the international approach too?</p><p>Well, the global pattern is to look at resources from a commercial perspective, focusing on the monetary and commercial value. The profit-maximising extractivism is what has caused climate change. Businesses thrive on creating a lot of artificial demand so people will consume more. Production and consumption thus result from profit interests. Sustainability and social equity are not prioritised. This mindset needs to change.</p><p>Do you think that will happen?</p><p>Yes, I see mindsets changing, especially among young people. There is a trend of people reducing consumption to reduce their carbon footprint. They are also in the streets and taking action demanding governments to take drastic actions to save their future. Many people pay attention to recycling, moreover, buying second-hand clothes instead of new ones, for example. There is also a spirit of volunteering. People clean up, collect garbage and don't create more waste. Small changes matter. The more people join in, the more we will achieve. Nonetheless, we must still address the root causes. Those that have caused the crisis need to change their behaviour immediately. Systemic changes at a global scale to change the extractivist and unsustainable economic system must be implemented.</p><p>Were you happy with the results of the climate summit in Egypt last year?</p><p>It is a big step forward that a loss and damage mechanism will be established. I see it as a crucial accountability mechanism. From the perspective of indigenous peoples, loss and damage means renewing our harmonious relationship with nature. It is important to rehabilitate areas that were destroyed and degraded, and it requires funding and technical support. Direct, appropriate and adequate support and assistance to indigenous communities suffering from the impacts of climate change such as flooding and drought should also be provided. We need to ensure that the environmental destruction will not happen again.</p><p>What dangers are looming on the way to a sustainable world?</p><p>A just transition is an important part of climate justice. We support the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it must not harm indigenous communities. Unfortunately, that is what is happening. Our land is being grabbed for renewable energy projects - whether for windmills, solar farms or dams. The extraction of transition minerals without the consent of indigenous peoples, without equity and the protection of the environment is green colonialism in the name of climate action. We need to make sure that human rights are upheld and principles of social justice are applied in the course of the transition. Far too often, we indigenous peoples are not considered. Our resources are exploited without our free, prior and informed consent which is part of our fundamental right. Once again, we are on the losing end. We are being sacrificed, even though we are doing the most to protect the global environment.</p><p>What is your organisation, Indigenous Peoples Rights International (IPRI), doing?</p><p>We are raising awareness, supporting communities defending their lands, territories and resources and advancing policy reforms for the respect and protection of indigenous peoples' rights against criminalisation and human-rights violations with impunity. We insist on solutions that respect rights and facilitate inclusion. When decisions are made without us, no one understands the impacts of climate change and so-called development on our lives. We are doing what we can to make ourselves heard. We are not simply victims, we insist on our rights and we provide solutions.</p><p>Do you see racism in how the climate crisis is being addressed?</p><p>Yes, there is a strong racist undercurrent. Some people are privileged and others are denied their rights and a life in dignity. 'Why would we change our economic system and comfortable lifestyles?' is a racist attitude when the poor people, the majority of which are the 'coloured people' are suffering because of these. It flies in the face of the need for global solidarity to drastically reduce carbon emission at its source and assist those that are suffering from the impacts of climate change but have contributed the least.</p><p>In 2018, you were labelled a terrorist by the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, who was the president of the Philippines. How did that change your life?</p><p>I fully understand what human-rights defenders at risk are facing. It really affects you emotionally and mentally. It causes a lot of uncertainty, stress and anxiety. It becomes hard to focus on the work you want to do. Sometimes it makes it very difficult to pursue different advocacy strategies because of the risk and possible consequences to the life and well-being of activists in the front line.</p><p>Did you begin to doubt your mission?</p><p>No, I did not. Indeed, the government's approach strengthened my belief that we must not consider this kind of authoritarian governance normal. We need change. Trampling on human rights is plainly unacceptable. What I found encouraging, was the strong expression of solidarity at the local, national and international level. It was quite overwhelming, and ultimately made the administration drop the charges, not only against me, but other activists as well. At that time, UNEP, the UN Environment Programme, gave me the Champions of the Earth award. More generally speaking, environmental activists and human-rights defenders deserve to be honoured. We are not terrorists and should not be forced to live in fear. We are promoting the common good, not special interests.</p><p>Does the IPRI have more encouraging news from other countries?</p><p>Yes, recent developments in Brazil and Colombia are quite encouraging. People who are partners of IPRI have recently risen to powerful positions. S\u00f4nia Guajajara is now Brazil's federal minister for indigenous peoples, and Leonor Zalabata Torres is now Colombia's new permanent representative to the UN in New York. She is a member of our board. These two strong women will hopefully be able to make invaluable contributions to advance the protection of our rights, well-being and aspirations not only in their respective countries but globally as well.</p><p>How do you assess climate justice in \u00admiddle- and low-income countries?</p><p>I see more and more social movements rising up in these countries. On the other hand, there are more authoritarian governments. Political repression is a huge challenge. We face increasing risks when we speak out. In most places, the approach to development is still unsustainable. The only good thing is that Jair Bolsonaro was not reelected in Brazil. However, he still has many supporters and there is a right-wing movement. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva attending the climate summit in Egypt, however, was a breath of fresh air. We as indigenous people met with him there and appreciated his clear commitment to protecting the Amazon.</p><p>How do you assess the situation in China?</p><p>China is a very complex country. What is clear is that China is aspiring dominance, which is why they are offering huge investments and funding. They are literally all over Asia, Africa and Latin America with investments. China does not have effective accountability mechanisms, and they have a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. The People's Republic of China is positioning itself as an economic power, but with no environmental or social safeguards including respecting and protecting human rights.</p><p>Do you see any positive impulses coming from China in terms of climate issues?</p><p>At the domestic level, I think they are trying to rise to the challenges. That is a good thing for the Chinese people. They focus on gaining economic control globally but not on achieving sustainability and social equity. They need to acknowledge that we share the world's resources and we must collectively manage them sustainably to the benefit of all of humanity. That is what global solidarity is about. We will all be doomed if every country - not only China - does what it can to protect its own people to the detriment of others.</p><p>Joan Carling is an indigenous rights and environmental activist.

The police had pretty much cleared the western German village of activists \"above ground,\" a spokesperson said on Saturday morning. Activists were still occupying around 15 \"structures,\" including treehouses and other hideouts.  Police were also trying to advance down a tunnel where two activists had barricaded themselves, according to the spokesman.   Activists in treehouses called out to wake one another in the early hours, according to a dpa reporter at the scene. Large parts of the site were lit with floodlights.  Workers resumed their demolition of the remaining buildings early on Saturday, including the home of the last farmer in the hamlet, according to the reporter.  Clearing and demolition work began on Wednesday in the L\\xFCtzerath, in state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Around 470 activists have since been removed, of whom 320 left voluntarily, according to the police.   The police knew about four injured activists, the spokesperson said, noting that the injuries had occurred during \"resistance activities\" such as people glueing themselves to things, as well as one fall.  Five police officers had been injured by pyrotechnics, while charges were issued against 124 people, mainly for breach of peace and resistance, the spokesperson said.  L\\xFCtzerath is the latest flashpoint for climate activists opposed to Germany's continued use of coal.  The energy company RWE, which owns the site, wants to excavate the lignite underneath. According to the government, this is necessary to ensure energy security. The activists reject this, arguing that the lignite in the current open-cast mine is sufficient.  Later on Saturday, Thunberg is expected to take part in the rally against the demolition of L\\xFCtzerath.

The 10 billion fund, announced by Bezos in Feb 2020, was set up to provide funds to programs, organizations and various efforts undertaken to fight climate change, bring down the carbon levels across the world and offer better data programs and analytics to monitor the economics and the results of this new economy.   On Monday, Amazon announced that $2 billion of the $10 billion would be set aside for restoring nature and changing food systems. Earlier, during Climate Week NYC held in September, the Bezos Earth Fund had committed $1 billion for nature, bringing the total amount spent to $3 billion for conservation, landscape restoration, and food-systems transformation.   Bezos Earth Fund CEO Andrew Steer said, \"The goal of the Bezos Earth Fund is to identify the major transitions we need to go through as an economy and as a society in the world, and to identify where we can help accelerate these transitions that are necessary.\"     The Bezos Earth Fund is completely different from the Climate Pledge Fund set up at Amazon. The Climate Pledge Fund is committed to developing technologies that Amazon and other companies will require to be carbon emissions free by 2040.     At the Bezos Earth Fund, there is a committed team of professionals that make plans for investment. They make proposals, do research and advise.   According to Steer, the evolution to a green economy is a series of large changes, and within each of those large changes, there is another series of smaller steps.   \"There is a big transition, like the energy system, the food system, manufacturing, the built environment, transportation, and so on. And each of these has four or five sub-transitions, which in and of themselves are quite large,\" he added.

One of them is Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya, a farmer and mountain guide. According to data from the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Germanwatch, Lake Palcacocha, located several kilometres above Huaraz, has more than quadrupled in volume since 2003. It is now 34 times larger than it was in 1970. Climate change is raising the risk that large ice blocks will break off the glacier and fall into the lake, which would cause a destructive tidal and inundate the city with a metre of water.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya refuses to simply accept this threat. In November 2015, with support from Germanwatch, he filed a lawsuit against the energy company RWE in a Germancivil court. The company is one of many corporations whose business model is based on fossil fuels. RWE is one of Europe's largest carbon emitters, and Germany's largest. It must therefore bear some responsibility for the climate crisis in general and the flooding risk in Huaraz in particular.</p><p>Special about this lawsuit is that, for the first time, someone affected by climate change is asking a private company to contribute in the necessary protective measures.

He wants its contribution to be commensurate with the company's share of responsibility for the global climate crisis.</p><p>According to 'Carbon Majors', a report published by the NGO Climate Justice Programme in 2014, RWE is accountable for 0.47 percent of all greenhouse gases emitted globally since the beginning of the industrial era. According to data from Germanwatch, the construction of a levee on the Andean lake would cost around $ 4 million. Approximately half a percent of that would be $ 20,000, which would be RWE's contribution.</p><p>Risk of a water shortage and flooding</p><p>Should RWE be unable for legal reasons to fund protective measures along the lake, the plaintiff wants the conglomerate to pay a share of the costs for the measures that are needed to protect his house from the risk of flooding. From the start, it mattered to Lliuya that the lawsuit would not only benefit him personally. He is committed to protecting his home town and its people.

Ultimately, the German court case could set a precedent that others affected by climate change could invoke in court. That too would exert pressure on policymakers.</p><p>Big win after initial defeat</p><p>The Peruvian activist initially suffered a defeat. The Regional Court of Essen, Germany, dismissed his case in 2016. However, the court of next instance, the Higher Regional Court of Hamm, determined at the end of 2017 that a civil claim against RWE was possible in principle. It decided to start hearing evidence, and that was a big win for the climate movement. For the first time, judges confirmed that a private company is responsible in principle for its share of climate-\u00adrelated damage.</p><p>The Higher Regional Court of Hamm decided to gather evidence on-site in \u00adHuaraz. That procedure had to be postponed multiple times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Finally, in late 2022, it became possible to make the trip, and two judges from the Higher Regional Court travelled to Peru with court-appointed experts. They wanted to determine whether the plaintiff's house would actually be threatened by a potential tidal wave.</p><p>Concerns about a flood of lawsuits</p><p>The experts have not yet compiled their report. It will be submitted to the court and the parties, and the litigants will get time to file their responses. Quite possibly, the report will then be discussed in an oral hearing as well. According to media reports, the Higher Regional Court expects the next oral hearing to take place in the first half of 2023.</p><p>RWE is casting doubt both on its liability and the admissibility of the climate lawsuit. Before the court, its attorneys expressed the concern that this case might trigger a flood of lawsuits against private-sector companies. The corporation is trying to show that it is impossible to attribute glacier melting in the Andes to the emissions caused by an individual company. RWE is even questioning whether climate change is causing the melting. Scientists, meanwhile, have delivered new arguments in support of Lliuya. A research team from the University of Oxford has modelled the retreat of a glacier above Lake Palcacocha and the corresponding increase in the flood risk. They thus established a rather clear causal chain for a worsening flood risk in specific places due to climate change.</p><p>Climate activists have long argued that countries with high past and current emissions, as the instigators of global warming, should financially support low-income countries that are dealing with damage and losses. Companies like RWE should also bear some of the costs of the risks and \u00addamages that are being incurred as a result of their business model.

The two are determined to chain themselves up as soon as an attempt is made to get them out, the spokesperson for L\\xFCtzerath Lebt (L\\xFCtzerath Lives) activist group said, as a huge police operation to clear the site for mining operations goes into its third day.  The discovery of the underground passages, made on Thursday, could hamper police plans to finish the evacuation of the village, which sits next to the vast Garzweiler II open-cast mine, by Friday.  Residents left the hamlet near the town of Erkelenz long ago in order to make way for the mine operations. But activists, in a bid to change L\\xFCtzerath's fate, moved in. They erected tree houses, occupied buildings and built barricades.  L\\xFCtzerath is now the latest flashpoint in a long-running battle between climate protesters - who are demanding a radical rethink of the government's climate change policies - and the German government.  On Thursday, a video of two hooded men posted on YouTube, which has been verified by police, caused a stir. In it, activists under the names \"Pinky\" and \"Brain\" claimed to be in the tunnel under L\\xFCtzerath.   The Aachen police chief Dirk Weinspach, whose officers are leading the operation, climbed a little way into the tunnel shaft on Friday and concluded that special forces would need to take over.  \"I just think it's terrible what dangers these people are taking on, for themselves,\" he said, although he added that he did not think the two people were in immediate danger.   \"Officers are currently trying to make contact and talk to the persons concerned,\" he said. They had lost telephone service and were trying to communicate with them via radio.   L\\xFCtzerath Lebt said the two activists underground were staying at a depth of 4 metres and that there was a \"ventilation system\" for them.  Police are also planning to evacuate the last remaining occupied house in the village, which was bought by the energy company RWE to mine the site for lignite, or brown coal.   According to an estimate by a dpa reporter, there were still several dozen activists occupying a fenced-in area, although around 300 had been cleared out by police over the last few days.  The remaining activists were holding out, despite heavy rain, strong winds and temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius early on Friday.  A large rally has been set for Saturday in L\\xFCtzerath's neighbouring town of Keyenberg to show support for the activists. Police expect 6,000 to 7,000 participants.   Famous climate activist Greta Thunberg from Sweden is scheduled to attend. \"Join us from 12:00 to protect lives and prioritise people over profits,\" she wrote on Twitter.  In the face of the movement's continued support, German Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck slammed the actions of the activists.  \"There are many good reasons to demonstrate for more climate protection, even against the Greens,\" the Green party politician told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine.  \"But L\\xFCtzerath is simply the wrong symbol,\" Habeck added, explaining that the demolition of the village in fact didn't symbolize continued activity at the nearby mine but its end.  It had been agreed last year to bring forward a planned coal power phase-out in the nearby mine by eight years, to 2030, which had always been the goal of the climate movement, Habeck added.   It is not clear whether his Green Party supports him on this issue, however. By Friday, more than 2,000 Green Party members had signed an open letter against the eviction, explicitly calling on Habeck and the state's Economy Minister Mona Neubaur to stop the action.   The \"negotiated deal with the energy company RWE threatens to break with the principles of our party,\" it says, adding: \"And not only that, we are also breaking with the Paris Climate Agreement, the traffic light coalition agreement and the last trust of the climate justice movement.\"  The co-federal spokesperson of the Green Youth, Timon Dzienus, warned against alienating the Greens from the climate movement. \"Right now, the Greens would need the support of the climate movement,\" he told the news portal t-online. \"The RWE deal doesn't help at all,\" he said.  Meanwhile, activists of the climate group Extinction Rebellion on Friday also protested in front of the RWE headquarters in the city of Essen, with some chaining themselves to the entry gate.  According to a poll by broadcaster ZDF, a majority of Germans are against the expansion of lignite mining areas. Of those surveyed, 59% were against such an expansion, while 33% were in favour.   Most significantly, a clear majority (87%) of Green voters oppose the project.   On the other hand, 60% of respondents consider the increased use of coal-fired power plants to secure the electricity supply during the energy crisis to be the right thing to do.

Early on, she declared that she was keen on a feminist development policy (see interview on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). Now she has begun to flesh out what that means.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Berlin in September, Schulze emphasised equality. She pointed out that, wherever women bear equal responsibility, development results consistently turn out better than where women are denied equal rights. This applies to incomes as well as to indicators for health and education, for example.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Women all over the world, according to Schulze, want equality. The self-confident protests of Iranian women in recent weeks are proof of that applying to the Middle East and North Africa, a world region where women are often still denied their rights.</p><p>Schulze sees equality as a human-rights issue. Accordingly, a free and equal society must end all kinds of discrimination, not only gender discrimination. Her approach is intersectional. As a Social Democrat, she says, she fights all kinds of inequality, and minorities must not be marginalised.</p><p>Women and girls, however, make up more than half of humankind, so they are not a minority. Nonetheless, they are often marginalised. In Schulze's eyes, awareness raising and targeted action are needed. Not only state agencies must rise to the challenge, but civil society and faith-based organisations are relevant too.</p><p>Schulze has directed her ministry to pay even more attention to gender issues than it has done in the past. By 2025, the share of projects that serve gender justice in developing countries in some way is set to rise from about 60 % today to 85 %, and 93 % of all new projects will promote the cause.</p><p>Long history</p><p>The minister acknowledges that feminism has a long history. While much has been achieved, a lot remains to be done. She insists that feminism needs to be advanced with determination at all levels and that she is not willing to wait. From peacebuilding to climate justice, women's input in policymaking leads to better and more sustainable results, she argues.</p><p>Sexual and reproductive rights are crucial, in Schulze's eyes, because self-\u00addetermination begins with one's own body. Families' welfare depends on female empowerment. The minister wants women to be seen as agents of change and not merely as victims. Where girls are denied school opportunities, economies perform worse (see Sundus Saleemi on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Schulze's agenda is not anti-men. She states clearly that men matter, not least because they are the rule-makers in many countries. The challenge she sees is to reach out to them and convince them. As young people are the future, the policymaker adds, it is important to give them a say. In her view, listening to one another is important, and euro-centrism is not an option.</p><p>Whole of government</p><p>Schulze intends to promote this comprehensive agenda in international cooperation and alliances. The Federal Government as a whole endorses this approach. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has similarly made a commitment to feminist policy-making. As Schulze reports, even Chancellor Olaf Scholz has declared himself to be a feminist.</p><p>In Berlin, Spogmay Ahmed of the Washington-based International Center for Research on Women welcomed Germany's approach to feminist development cooperation. She emphasised that supported groups must be co-owners and co-leaders, not mere recipients.</p><p>Alvaro Bermejo of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) endorses Schulze's call for action. Progress is not achieved in a long-lasting marathon, according to him, but in fast sprints. The experience of his home country, Spain, shows that change may seem impossible for a long time and then happens suddenly. Given that right-wing authoritarians are eager to move backwards on reproductive rights in many places, he says now is the time to 'go, go, go'.</p><p>According to Sima Bahous of UN Women, humanity is currently not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030 as spelled out in the UN's 5th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). SDG5, however, is indispensable for achieving the entire agenda.

The summit has turned this idyllic corner of Bavaria into a high-security zone that has impacted local businesses and schools, as Sabine Kinkartz found out.Chocolate is everywhere you look. Different varieties are stacked on large plates in a display case. There's cranberry white next to peanut-salt-whole-milk, and dark chocolate refined with cardamom, clove and pepper. Chocolatier Franz Ksser makes the delicacies and sells them in his store in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. But customers have been staying away for weeks. \"We're losing out big time,\" Ksser says angrily. </p><p><br/>Garmisch-Partenkirchen is a spa town in UpperBavaria that lives primarily from tourism. Skiers come in the winter, hikers in the summer. \"The tourist beds are occupied, but for the past three weeks they've been police officers, security guards and people doing the set-up for the G7 summit,\" Ksser says, explaining his problem. \"Of course, they don't shop with us or eat with us, because they're catered for differently.\" <br/>And it's not just him, he adds: \"I went out to eat last night, there were three people sitting in the restaurant, where normally everything is booming at this time of year.\" <br/>Even the schools are closed <br/>At least 18,000 police officers have been deployed to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Elmau, the small village located above the resort town in a valley that is difficult to access, to provide security for the G7 summit. Police cars are lined up everywhere, and helicopters are repeatedly rattling through the air. <br/>The heads of state and government are hermetically sealed off at Schloss Elmau, a remote luxury spa retreat, while in Garmisch the media center has been set up for the 3,000 or so journalists who have arrived. Hundreds of manhole covers have been sealed with white stickers, no trash cans are allowed on the streets, schools are closed, with students forced to take their classes online. <br/>Police checkpoints have been set up on all access roads within a radius of 16 kilometers (10 miles). Motorists must stop, personal details are checked. The plan is to spot and filter out troublemakers and potentially violent protesters before they reach Garmisch. <br/>Lentil stew with the chancellor <br/>\"Many activists don't come because of the checks, they don't want to be searched and are also afraid of repression,\" says Tatjana S\u00f6ding, who together with Christopher Olk has pitched her tent in a protest camp on a meadow on the edge of Garmisch. S\u00f6ding has just completed her master's degree in human ecology, Olk is doing a doctorate in international political economy. Both belong to the \"Stop G7Elmau\" alliance, which plans to stage several protest rallies throughout the summit. <br/>\"Seven heads of state are pursuing their own interests and their decisions affect the world's population, which is not allowed to have a say,\" Olk criticizes. \"They talk about climate justice, but their very own specific, political and economic interests are in the foreground, which don't allow for real climate justice at all.\" <br/>It was pouring with rain when S\u00f6ding and Olk arrived Friday evening. \"It was a little uncomfortable.\" Now, barefoot and in summer clothes, the two stand in the sun on the lawn and watch as more and more tents are erected at the protest camp. Authorities have approved 750 protesters. <br/>What would the two say if they had the opportunity to speak with Chancellor Olaf Scholz in person? \"I would invite him to eat a lentil stew with us and then we would talk about how we can make Germany part of a just world,\" Olk says, laughing incredulously. But talking to the chancellor is not on the cards. <br/>Instead, it has been suggested to the activists that 50 of them be driven up to Elmau, where they could demonstrate out of sight of the heads of state and government, under guard. But they find that unacceptable. \"Freedom of movement and assembly will be severely restricted,\" S\u00f6ding criticizes. <br/>Will the protest remain peaceful? <br/>The plan is for the demonstrators to march through the town at the bottom of Garmisch, but they also want to try to advance through the mountain forest to Elmau in a so-called \"star march,\" in which several groups converge on an agreed point from different directions. The police know this and have already announced that the activists will not get far. \"There is a lot of police in Garmisch, and there is a reason for that,\" said the police chief of Upper Bavaria South, Manfred Hauser as he presented the security concept to the media. <br/>Business people in Garmisch hope the protests will remain peaceful. \"Many residents have gone away for a few days,\" says chocolatier Ksser. \"But we had already planned all the vacations here in the store when we learned six months ago that a G7 summit was to be held in Elmau for the second time.\" The last time, in 2015, he added, they had been informed a year and a half in advance and could have planned differently: \"I can't send people on vacation now.\" <br/>G7 still up to date? <br/>Ksser is certain there will be no third G7 summit here. \"Never again G7,\" he says with fervor in his voice. \"The people here in town wouldn't go along with that, and it's supported by some in the local council.\" The chocolatier criticizes that the whole effort is not even in keeping with the times. \"We're supposed to heat less and shower less, and here they're banging out the energy with hundreds of police cars driving around and helicopters doing practice flights for weeks.\" <br/>Ksser doesn't deny that meetings of heads of state and government are necessary. \"But please not in this format,\" he said. \"There are hundreds of people in each entourage. Why don't they meet with their closest circle of advisors, and all the other people can meet on the internet these days, can't they?\" <br/>There are also places where such meetings could be better held, he said. \"In (US Air Force Base) Ramstein, a NATO summit was organized at very short notice with important people, and the US president was able to land directly on the site with his Airforce One.

The case is part of a global trend that has seen activists accuse states of failing to protect rights through inadequate climate policy.Brenda Odimba walked into Brussels' Justitia courthouse with a very clear message for her government: \"Please stop denying your inaction and start taking action.\"The engineer is one of more than 60,000 Belgian citizens that have taken the country's federal and regional authorities to court over what they claim are unlawful climate policy failings.\"We are not happy about what the government is doing,\" Odimba told DW, \"As citizens, we have to push them because they are simply not listening to us.\"The lawsuit, known as the \"3,\" was lodged by Klimaatzaak (Climate Case), a non-governmental organization (NGO), in 2014. Since then, tens of thousands of people have signed a petition to become co-plaintiffs. Oral arguments in the case entered their final day on Friday, with the verdict expected before summer.Abusing human rights through negligence \"This is probably the biggest court case in Belgian legal history,\" Klimaatzaak ambassador David van Reybrouk told DW. </p><p>\"The argument is that Belgian climate policies are endangering human rights now and in the future,\" he said.The claimants are demanding authorities reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% of 1990 levels by 2030, and have denounced the state for failing to serve and protect citizens by falling short of previous international climate targets set as far back as 1992.Climate litigation breaking new ground across the globeBelgium is the latest in a string of European countries whose governments have been brought before the courts by environmental organizations.In 2019, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands made global headlines when it ordered the nation's government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% of 1990 levels by the end of 2020, \"due to the risk of dangerous climate change that could have a severe impact on the lives and welfare of the residents of the Netherlands.\"The decision \u2014 partially based on government obligations to protect human rights \u2014 came after a long legal battle fought by the Netherlands NGO Urgenda. Similar rulings followed in Ireland in 2019 and France in 2020.\"Since 2015, we've seen an acceleration in the number of these cases and a broadening in their range of theories and targets,\" Nigel Brook, a British lawyer specialized in climate change liability, told DW. \"We do see this very much as a trend,\" he added.Brook said taking governments to court was not the preferred method for changing policy, \"It's really if all else fails,\" he said.Yet the lawyer believes litigation can force tangible results. \"The Dutch government took a number of measures following the Urgenda ruling,\" Brook said. \"They reduced speed limits on motorways but they also accelerated their closure of coal-fired power plants.\"Many observers are closely watching a crowdfunded class action suit making its way through the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The case, lodged by a group of young people from Portugal, accuses 33 countries of \"failing to do their part to avert the climate catastrophe.\"Belgium defends its recordIn the Brussels courtroom, lawyers representing the Belgian government insisted that authorities have taken the climate crisis seriously.Speaking of the government's approach to the climate crisis today, lawyer Nathalie Van Damme said, \"There is a real awareness: you can see it in the 2020 government accord,\" according to courtroom reporting by French-language Belgian broadcaster RTBF.Indeed, when Belgian parties hashed out the coalition agreement that set the course for the new government in September 2020, they dedicated an entire section to plans for \"A Sustainable Country.\"Since then, Environment Minister Zakia Khattabi of Belgium's French-speaking Green Party (known as Ecolo) has also pushed ahead with a sustainable development plan that had been on hold for a decade amid past government crises and coalition chaos.Even Klimaatzaak's David van Reybrouk agreed that Belgian authorities had made progress in recent years but insisted it simply was \"not enough.\"No social justice without climate justice As oral arguments neared their end, Brenda Odimba said she would be eagerly awaiting the judges' final verdict, due in a few months' time.

About 88 per cent of the 412 people who cast votes in the online gathering gave their backing to the platform, which will now guide the party into September's federal elections. The paper is titled \"Time to Act: For social security, peace and climate justice!\"  The party, whose name literally means \"The Left,\" is looking at the polls with worries that it might only take between 6 and 7 per cent of the vote. Party leaders used the weekend session to argue that this shows how important it is to show unity going into the elections.  \"As of now, we are in an election campaign,\" said Janine Wissler, one of the party's lead candidates. Dietmar Bartsch, who leads the ticket with her, called for \"discipline and determination.\"  \"Our idea of a world with solidarity and social justice is and remains right up to date,\" he said.  Among the ideas being pushed in the programme are a call for the rich to be asked to pay more to cover the costs the coronavirus has inflicted upon German society. They also want a four-day workweek with no pay reduction and an increase of the basic holiday expectation in Germany from 24 days to 36.  Other platform proposals demand a hike in the minimum pay rate from 9.50 euros (11.50 dollars) to 13 euros, a minimum pension of 1,200 euros, rent caps, more support for health care and a policy that would give workers a day off even if a holiday comes on the weekend.  The main point of their programme, they say, is a \"redistribution from the top to the bottom.\" The programmes would be financed with a combination of increases to income and property taxes.  On climate matters, the party committed itself to policies that would limit global warming to an increase of 1.5 degrees and for a climate neutral economy by 2035. Investment programmes would help industry make the change, as well as efforts to improve consumer behaviour, for instance by providing more support for public transportation.

The African Continent, some organizers have said, will shape the future of the world.  We truly believe that the leaders who will assemble in Washington have the best intentions in mind. They will be determined to effect positive change on everything from African governance and human rights to food security and education. The heads of state and business and government leaders who will meet during the Summit's U.S.-African Business Forum will try in good faith to advance mutually beneficial two-way trade and investment partnerships.  As history has demonstrated, however, promises made at such lofty meetings, no matter how heartfelt, are frequently not kept. History tells us that time and time again, the high ideals, good words, handshake commitments (and even contractual obligations) which are reached at these meetings have, for any range of intervening reasons, been ignored, set aside, overlooked, or found to be too ambitious to complete. (Consider, for example, the West committing to giving $100 billion a year by 2020 to help emerging economies reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. When the original target was missed, it was moved - and has yet to be met.)  To the extent possible, dear Sirs, let's avoid building such bridges to nowhere in this Summit.  What to Do About Africa's Energy Resources  As you'd imagine given the authorship of this Open Letter, our true aim herein is to speak on the issue of Africa's energy resources and the policies that will prevail in the Continent's use of those resources.  We are aware that, inevitably, the topic of African energy will arise, interwoven as it is with issues ranging from the effect of climate change to the potential for industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth.  There's no question that African energy is a hot-button topic, pitting climate activists who want the continent to keep its considerable hydrocarbon assets (including newly found natural gas reserves) in the ground, on the one hand, against others who recognize that fossil fuels cannot be discarded in Africa in the short run if the continent hopes realistically to lift people out of energy - and real - poverty.  Under the banner of \"climate justice,\" the many in the developed world have cut off public financing for new African fossil fuel projects - although that hasn't stopped them from bankrolling or even subsidizing their own hydrocarbon activities or seeking feverishly to secure increased hydrocarbon commodities for a European Union threatened by an unprovoked and unjust war. Wealthy nations contend that because Africa is more vulnerable than most to the severe effects of climate change, the continent must abandon its oil and gas opportunities, and the economic and social improvements that come with it, and switch to renewables - NOW. In fact, Sirs, the true impact of future climate crises on everyday Africans is actually exacerbated by their current state of impoverishment. Without the minimal level of development and infrastructure, Africans face harsher consequences BECAUSE they don't have the accoutrements of development-shelter, power, diet, and personal amenities-that people in the developed world will use on an individual basis to defend against any creeping climate degradation. That is, to give Africans an even chance to survive climate disasters of the future, let's give them the resources to bring them up to the level of personal protections that others around the world have.  Africa's Hydrocarbon Resources Must be Considered In the Global Context, Not in a Vacuum  First, as is widely known, to the degree that greenhouse gases cause climate change, the problem is not of Africa's own making.  It is irrefutably known that Africa produces an infinitesimal amount of greenhouse gases and has the lowest emissions per capita of any region on earth.  At an event during COP 27, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) reminded participants that Africa, where one-fifth of the world's population lives, currently contributes only 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  How would monetizing Africa's natural gas reserves change that figure? Not very much, especially in light of how it would benefit everyday Africans.  According to Birol, were the continent to turn all of its natural gas discoveries into production it would add 90 billion cubic meters (bcm) of useful energy by 2030. Two-thirds of that could be used for domestic needs - among other things, to provide power to the 600 million Africans who still lack access to electricity and to wean the 900 million Africans (mostly women) who rely on biomass for cooking off the hazardous stuff - and the rest exported, and even then the amount of greenhouse gases coming out of Africa would rise only to 3.4%, \"which is nothing,\" Birol said.  Yet the world is trying to keep that solution out of our reach.  Second, it is countries that prospered via fossil-fueled industrialization that wish to deny us the same privilege. Despite the fact that fossil fuels enabled the technological revolution and have led to massive improvements in quality of life and longevity across the globe - all things Africa needs, deserves, and has the hydrocarbon means to achieve - big economies want us to stop using oil and natural gas as soon as possible.  But, as Miriam Hinostroza, an environmental economist with the UN Environment Programme, told UN News, that's out of the question. Banning fossil fuels within the next decade, she said, \"is not a reality\" - at least not without economic and social fallout.  \"Sometimes, a priority for countries is economic growth, which they only get from using fossil fuels - they are still cheap, the technologies are there, there are many power plants [and] they cannot [all of a sudden] just get rid of these plants, Hinostroza said.  Economist Vijaya Ramachandran goes even further.  \"It is not fair for rich countries to fight climate change at the cost of low-income countries' development and climate resilience,\" Ramachandran wrote for nature.com. Instead, she suggests the adoption of funding criteria that consider economic growth alongside climate impact, where countries with \"lower per-capita incomes, low emissions, or high use of green energy are deemed more eligible for development projects that depend on fossil fuels.\" One example: using the 4.2 trillion cubic meters (tcm) of natural gas along the Tanzania-Mozambique border to expand access to electricity and generate much-needed revenue in two \"low-income, low-emitting countries.\"  Third, a fossil fuel-free world doesn't reflect current market realities - including how accustomed Europeans are to keeping their homes and businesses warm and well-lighted, especially during a dark and blustery winter. Yes, in a perfect world, the wind would always blow, the sun would always shine, and Russia would never have invaded Ukraine, meaning natural gas supplies would still move unfettered across Europe.  But with none of this being the case, since June the EU has returned to using coal, the dirtiest energy source (although at least it banned imports of Russian coal). Somehow, EU officials believe they can take that step without \"derailing their longer-term climate goals.\" And even though the European Parliament labeled investments in gas and nuclear power plants as climate-friendly, unrelenting pressure to keep African gas in the ground remains, and renewables advocates say there should be no new investment in infrastructure that would bring African gas to Europe.  Fourth, despite arguments that investments into Africa's fossil fuel sector are undermining the enormous potential of Africa's renewables, growth is already underway. Most of the electricity in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, and Uganda comes from hydroelectric power, and several other countries have taken steps toward scaling up other renewables through policy-building, regional collaboration, and investment promotion.  The problem, however, is that investment in the continent's wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable power-generating projects was just $2.6 billion in 2021, an 11-year low. Of the $434 billion invested in renewables worldwide, Africa's share was just 0.6%. Before Africa can more fully embark on a low-carbon future there must be global strategies for mobilizing capital into renewables, and the world must honor the billion-dollar promises it has already made.  Let's Avoid Being Ad Hoc About Africa's Role in Climate Change Remediation  As many of you know, delegates at COP27 agreed to create a fund that would compensate poorer nations harmed by climate change. Eligible countries are in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean.  Reaction to the announcement has been far-ranging, from cheers to assertions that it is paternalistic (and perhaps even racist), to the earnest admissions of some scientists that it's difficult at his stage to gauge climate change damage in such regional terms or tell if a specific weather event is even due to climate change.  Then there were those who asked if, instead of receiving loss-and-damage dollars, African nations could be paid to keep hydrocarbons in the ground, thereby avoiding whatever greenhouse gases they would emit. Of course, any such \"reparations,\" as they have been loosely (and, from a legal standpoint, inaccurately) called, depend on the UN actually raising the estimated $290 billion to $580 billion required ANNUALLY to keep the loss-and-damage fund going. And as we know, no matter how good the intentions, it's not always easy to bring them to fruition.  In specific regards to Africa's energy resources, we encourage participants to promote a sustainable development of Africa, including universal energy access - recognizing that it will require a variety of energy sources. Africa has too much oil and natural gas to ignore, especially when they can be used to raise people to the way of life most Americans have been enjoying for decades. Africa should not be the test case for a renewables-only future because the world finds itself in a panic over emissions. We have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to negative externalities. Ramachandran has said Africa needs reliable energy infrastructure, not rich-world hypocrisy. To paraphrase Benjamin Attia and Morgan Bazilian of the Colorado School of Mines, limiting the use of fossil fuels in Africa can make poverty and inequality worse while not accomplishing much in the way of reducing global greenhouse emissions, especially as fossil fuel use continues around the world.  In the End, Dear Delegates, We Ask for This  We at the Africa Energy Chamber are not writing this letter with animosity, nor are we neutral on the importance of d\\xE9tente between the US and Africa on the range of issues that are on the agenda of the Summit. Indeed, we are candidly grateful for the robust approach the new US Administration has taken on matters of US/Africa cooperation. We applaud the US leadership for its continuous engagement with us as well as various African Presidents. But any observer of the growing indecisiveness on the future of Africa's use of its resources for its own betterment must agree that the Summit offers a chance to break energy transition stalemate and offer solutions to Africa's dual obligations to support climate-smart policies while also striving to end the vast energy deficit and economic poverty on the Continent.  We know that, for three days in Washington, D.C., everyone will work toward tangible, measurable results. What we hope is that, throughout the events, the Parties gravitate towards mutual accommodation and the overall betterment of conditions in Africa.  Most of all, we are asking that everyone who attends the Summit only makes promises they can keep. The time for empty gestures is over. Today calls for action. The true test of how successful the Summit is will not be the news reports about it afterward but the results we see in the months and years to come.

The labor board said it would issue a complaint for unfair labor practices in the next few weeks if the case is not settled with the fired tech workers. As per reports, a trial date would be scheduled in four to six months.  The e-commerce giant had fired employees Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, in April 2020 for publicly criticizing conditions at its warehouses as unsafe during the coronavirus pandemic. Cunningham and Costa, both worked as user experience designers for Amazon, were warned earlier for criticizing the company's climate policies.  The NLRB's Seattle office, which is investigating the case, now has found merit in the employees' unfair labor practices claims against the company. According to the agency, Amazon may have violated the National Labor Relations Act that bars it from interfering with employee rights to engage in concerted activities.

Anna-Katharina Hornidge, the director of the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS) - assessed matters in an interview with D+C/E+Z. According to her, we are witnessing a global conflict in which irrational aspirations are pitted against reasoned deliberation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Humanity is facing global challenges that nation states on their own cannot rise to. Three examples are the climate crisis, disease control and ensuring a peaceful rule-based order. Has the concept of national sovereignty therefore become obsolete?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No, it has not. Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine shows that we need a joint understanding of sacrosanct borders. Peace is a precondition for achieving each and every one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They spell out a vision of the global common good that was adopted unanimously by all UN members.</p><p>However, the multilateral order is too weak to guarantee peace. When the aggressor is a permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC) and wields veto power, we see multilateral stalemate.</p><p>Yes, I think a reform of the UNSC is necessary, but hard to achieve. There probably should be no veto power at all. A good step in that direction is the decision that governments which use the veto right have to explain that step in the UN General Assembly. Moreover, it is important to make sure that the UNSC becomes more regionally representative. Africa and Latin America currently do not have permanent members at all, and the G7 are overrepresented. This imbalance reflects the state of global politics at the end of World War II, when decolonisation was only just beginning in Asia and had not started in Africa. This imbalance thwarts the legitimacy of the UNSC.</p><p>Even if the UNSC decided against Russia, sanctions would be hard to impose on a nuclear power.</p><p>Well, it would be wise not to try to stop the war by military means, but economic sanctions are evidently feasible. In this wider sense, the war is affecting the whole world. Western economic sanctions are biting, while Russia is using hunger strategically. In this setting, a UNSC decision against Russia would actually be useful in the information war, which is being fought not only, but especially in the digital sphere.</p><p>The implication is that sovereignty must go along with obligations today. It is no longer the same concept that helped to end the devastating Thirty Years War in Germany four centuries ago. The idea then was that whoever was the lord of a special area was free to do as he pleased - there was no she among them. Mustn't global interests override national interests today?</p><p>Putting a check on global problems is actually in every nation's properly understood self-interest. If humanity does not rise to the multitude of global challenges we are facing, every single country will fare worse. Opting out leads to disaster, so we need more cooperation. Only a stronger multilateral system will help us negotiate shared solutions and implement policies in a coherent manner.</p><p>Building such a system is obviously very difficult, but we cannot keep postponing action.</p><p>Yes indeed, and that is why we see various international alliances or clubs arising. They are supposed to deal with specific problems. At this point, there is no alternative to forming such alliances, but policymakers must pay attention to design them in an inclusive manner and not letting them undermine the existing multilateral system.</p><p>So what should policymakers do?</p><p>They should keep the alliances open and welcome new partners, including private-sector initiatives, civil-society organisations and subnational institutions. Alliances, moreover, must not define solutions in small circles and then try to impose their decisions on the rest of the world. In this sense, climate-justice partnerships like the one that was formed with South Africa at the Glasgow climate summit last year are quite promising. The partnership is in line with multilateral decision making in the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), but much more specific than what global negotiations have spelt out so far.</p><p>What are we going to do about reckless politicians and media propagandists who build careers on claiming that global forces are suppressing their nation? Right-wing populists in many countries thrive on pretending they are protecting the people against vicious international powers. They are a threat to democracy, which is why I think we do not show the whole picture when we say that the war in Ukraine is a war waged by despotism on democracy. The conflict is taking place within many countries, including EU members and the USA.</p><p>Yes indeed. We were lucky that Emmanuel Macron was reelected in France and that Italy looks more stable than many expected. The situation in Hungary and Poland is difficult, to put it mildly, and recent developments in the Philippines, India and Brazil are worrying. It is important to point out that the conflict between despotism and democracy is not raging only in Ukraine. It is actually a conflict between narrow-minded egotism and the common good, or if you like, between ratio and irratio. Just consider Vladimir Putin's claim that Ukraine does not really exist because of Russia's historical roots in Kyiv many centuries ago. By that logic, the city of Rome could lay claim to half of Europe, North Africa and large parts of the Middle East.</p><p>What about Putin's claim that NATO expansion hurts legitimate Russian interests?</p><p>Well, that claim only makes sense if one accepts that Russia is entitled to a sphere of influence which it controls and which, not coincidentally, largely coincides with the tsarist empire of the 19th century. NATO expansion was not the result of US imperialism. Because of their historical experiences with Russia, the acceding countries demanded to become members. We should bear in mind, moreover, that history shows that democratic states do not wage war on one another.</p><p>But elected governments do sometimes start wars. In 2003, the USA and Britain, for example, led a 'coalition of the willing' to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein...</p><p>This war was a big mistake and indeed illegal, and not only because there was no explicit UNSC mandate. But the war would have probably not happened had Iraq's leader been accountable to Iraqis. An elected government would most likely have agreed to letting international inspectors look for weapons of mass destruction. It would have had to pay attention to what people think, and they do generally not want to die for a dictator's military ambitions.</p><p>So why do so many governments in low and middle income countries hesitate to take sides against Russia today?</p><p>I think their ambivalence is more about not trusting western governments than having faith in Russia. There are many reasons. The western countries are - to a large part - the former colonial powers, and the Soviet Union supported liberation struggles in many places. Western countries' track record of promising things they later only hesitantly and incompletely deliver may matter even more. Just consider official development assistance, climate finance or vaccine supplies. Western governments tend to emphasise cooperative global governance when it suits them, but act in pursuit of national interests when they can. They also keep stressing human rights, but, when it comes to refugees, all too often disregard those rights. Russia's regime has a pattern of perpetual and blatant lies, but western governments' hypocrisy has destroyed trust too. In many people's eyes, it is equivalent.</p><p>But Russia's disregard for human rights and welfare is glaring.</p><p>Indeed, and it is not only evident in terms of Ukrainian suffering. Equally appalling is how the Russian leadership carelessly sacrifices the lives of thousands and thousands of its own young men. That is typical of undemocratic governance. Putin's nationalism has strong self-destructive tendencies.</p><p>What can western governments do to build trust, not least with an eye to forging the global alliances we need to rise to global challenges - and eventually reform the UN system?</p><p>First and foremost, they must keep their promises. Just one example: last year's G7 summit in Cornwall promised to make $ 1 billion available for vaccine provision internationally, and by January only 30 % had been disbursed. That was in the midst of a global pandemic, as we spelled out in a joint paper prepared by several think tanks recently (Kickbusch et al, 2022). If you don't live up to what you solemnly pledge, you can't expect others to trust you. This challenge is probably greater than many western policymakers realise. Their counterparts in developing countries know that their peoples are increasingly suffering climate impacts, and that the prosperous nations, which have contributed most to the problem, did not reduce carbon emissions as rigorously as they should have in the 30 years since the \u00adUNFCCC was agreed in Rio de Janeiro. Policy coherence is crucial for building trust. Western governments must act convincingly in the global arena, and that includes policy implementation at home. They must accelerate their own transformation towards sustainability.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 41, "title": "Pandemic, climate change and conflict fuel sharp rise in global hunger", "published": "2021-10-14", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oct 14, 2021( Deutsche Welle World: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429\">http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Nearly 50 countries are dealing with serious hunger levels as 320 million people lost access to adequate food last year, a newly released index shows.World hunger was set to end by 2030 \u2014 that was a goal set by United Nations in 2015. After years of progress reducing numbers of undernourished people since 1960, reaching zero hunger by 2030 seemed like an attainable target for the international community. </p><p><br/>But now, \"the fight against hunger is dangerously off track,\" the latest Global Hunger Index indicates. <br/>Over the past two years, economic fallout from the pandemic, climate change and armed conflict have fueled a sharp increase in the number of people going hungry around the world, according to the report by nongovernmental organizations Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide. <br/>The study, released Thursday, comes not long after the United Nations published data showing that the number of people who did not get adequate nutrition last year increased 320 million to 2.4 billion \u2014 amounting to nearly a third of the world's population. This increase is equivalent to that of the previous five years combined. <br/>\"We can clearly see that progress is slowing or even reversing,\" said Miriam Wiemers, one of the authors of the index. <br/>Beyond undernourishment and availability of calories, the index monitors other factors such as diet quality, stunted growth among children and child mortality. <br/>\"These factors reflect the long-term effects of hunger on the population health, and on children's physical, mental and cognitive development,\" Wiemers added. <br/>The index reveals how about 50 countries around the world are in an alarming or serious situation, meaning that hunger affects a significant part of their population. <br/>Climate change aggravates hunger <br/>A2021 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, a UN agency) connects global warming \u2014 in particular, more frequent and intense weather events such as storms, floods and droughts \u2014 to increased food insecurity. <br/>\"One of the reasons that [sub-Saharan] Africa has higher levels of hunger is because of lack of preparedness for climate change challenges,\" said Joe Mzinga, a spokesperson of ESAFF, a network small-scale farmers in eastern and southern Africa. <br/>Reliance on a single type of crop makes the population particularly vulnerable to climate change, Mzinga explained.  <br/>\"One of the biggest challenges that we're facing is the loss of biodiversity and the push for quite specific types of crops, which in the case of South and East Africa, is maize. <br/>\"Maize needs plenty of water [to grow], so a shortage of rainfall quickly leads to a food crisis.\" <br/>With these trends, there is also an unaddressed element of climate justice. \"We have countries with less share of carbon emission that carry the burden of climate change,\" Wiemers pointed out. <br/>Pandemic worsens existing challenges <br/>Supply chain breakdowns and restrictions attempting to stem the spread of COVID-19 simultaneously caused consumer prices to increase and producer prices to fall, decreasing food security for the urban and rural poor, the FAO reports. <br/>Add to that how pandemic curfews in many African and Asian countries inadvertently led to food losses, as drivers who normally transported fresh produce during the cooler nighttime hours were no longer able to do so. <br/>The pandemic also revealed how higher-income countries are similarly vulnerable to food price increases and shortages. According to government reports in the United States, prices of meat, poultry, fish and eggs rose 5.9% over last year, and were up 15.7% compared to August 2019. <br/>Due to the enduring impacts of the pandemic on the world's economy, the number of people who are estimated to be undernourished by 2030 will rise by 30 million, the FAO report showed.  <br/>Separately, other studies indicate 2.6 million children could suffer from stunted growth between 2020 and 2022 in low- and middle-income countries, compared with pre-pandemic expectations.  <br/>Vicious circle of hunger and violence <br/>Violent conflict can cripple every aspect of a food system. In conflict regions, crops are destroyed, livestock is stolen and people are driven off their land.  <br/>During a war, \"we cannot continue with production as usual, and we can't access markets as usual,\" Mzinga said.  <br/>Conflict is a major driver of hunger in eight out of 10 countries with alarming or extremely alarming levels of hunger, the index report says. Violent conflicts are increasing in number, as well as becoming more severe, it added. <br/>As conflict contributes to hunger, heightened food insecurity can contribute to violent conflict in a vicious cycle. As competition over scarce resources mounts, ethnic and religious divisions are more likely to spur conflict, a 2017 study by the World Food Program shows. <br/>\"Without resolving food insecurity, it is difficult to build sustainable peace, and without peace the likelihood of ending global hunger is minimal,\" the index report stated. <br/>Fighting hunger is not only about reaching our policy's target; it's about people's right to access adequate and nutritious food, Wiemers said. <br/>\"It's a basic human right.

For Glaswegians, the summit brings both high hopes and headaches. <br/>An army of local volunteers <br/>Community activist Graeme Edolls is among more than a thousand local residents giving up their free time in the hope of making the COP a success and making good on the city's official slogan: \"People Make Glasgow.\" <br/>\"I wanted to make sure local Glaswegians were heard as much as possible and to spread the message on how the climate crisis impacts the city,\" he told DW. <br/>The PhD student has spent the last few days transporting banners, flyers and COVID-19 tests around the city on an electric bike for the COP26 Coalition, a group of organizations and individuals mobilizing for climate justice. He'll be on the ground stewarding activists on November 6 when some 50,000 people are expected to take to the streets of Glasgow to demand change. <br/>\"We also have many volunteers opening up their homes for indigenous peoples traveling from around the world and other activists traveling here who've been priced out of COP26,\" Edolls said. Others still have been working with lawyers to secure visas for activists from the Global South. <br/>\"I'm proud that Glasgow will be on the world stage,\" he said. \"But I'm a bit apprehensive about what's about to hit this city.\" <br/>'This could have been a Zoom meeting' <br/>Shelby Robertson is already feeling the blow. She owns \"The Avalon\" pub, not far from the COP26 site. All nearby roads have heavy traffic restrictions \u2014 meaning her staff, customers and deliveries are struggling to make it in. <br/>\"There's a lot of frustration and anger,\" she said. \"People here feel like it's kind of been thrust upon them; there was no asking the people of Glasgow.\" <br/>The disruption isn't limited to the immediate area. For Glaswegians, life will be full of new hurdles for the next two weeks. <br/>\"People feel excluded and left out and hard done by in a way, even though it's for a great cause,\" Robertson said. \"I'm all for it, I do get it \u2014 but at the same time there's a lot of things that feel very unjust.\" <br/>\"You just think: This could have been a Zoom meeting, like we've all been doing for the past two years.\" <br/>Fears of a COVID spike <br/>Meanwhile, the UK is reporting tens of thousands of new COVID-19 cases daily. And with tens of thousands of people arriving from abroad, some Glasgow residents fear dire consequences. <br/>\"A lot of my customers are older, and they're very concerned,\" Robertson said. \"They're worried about there being a potential spike again because of all these people coming in and mingling, and we don't really know who's been vaccinated and who hasn't.\" <br/>Glasgow City Council insists all necessary COVID-19 measures are in place. <br/>Opportunities for Glaswegians to cash in on COP26 <br/>But the influx of guests also means an influx of cash for Glasgow locals. Amid fears of a major accommodation shortage during the COP, Airbnb offered a 100 (\u20ac119, $137) incentive to Glaswegians listing rooms on the website for the first time, pledging to donate service-fee revenues to the charity \"Zero Waste Scotland.\" <br/>Josh Hale was among those who heeded the call. \"Someone snapped it up within six hours of us putting it online,\" he said. \"It's been kind of wild in Glasgow. There's a buzz about the place.\" <br/>Hale and his fiancee will be able to cover almost three months' rent plus put something aside for their wedding with the money they'll make from a 12-day sublet to a Singaporean attendee. <br/>But he says a bigger reward would be seeing his hometown get a new entry in the history books. <br/>\"It's a really exciting prospect for Glasgow to play a major part in the arc of the whole Paris Agreement trajectory,\" he said. \"Looking back in 10 years' time, I'm hopeful there will be a 'Glasgow Agreement' that's seen as as important if not more important than the Paris Agreement.\" <br/>'I want the world to see Glasgow as it is' <br/>Volunteer Graeme Edolls thinks that, along with its gems, Glasgow's deep inequities should be on display to show world leaders precisely why they must commit to urgent action. <br/>\"I want people to see the fact that this city has one of the lowest life expectancies for men and women in the developed world,\" he said, \"and the fact we have a motorway that scars our city. ... The pollution directly contributes to the health inequalities we see.\" <br/>At the same time, he explained, \"I also want people to see the Glaswegian spirit.

A third draft suggested accelerating \"efforts toward\" their phase-out. <br/>By the time diplomats hammered out a text they could all agree to, the term was downgraded to a \"phase-down\" the use of unabated coal. <br/>The result of that semantic spat \u2014 watered down to levels well below what scientists say is needed to halt global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures \u2014 was among the hardest-fought outcomes of two weeks of international negotiations to stop the planet hurtling closer towards catastrophic changes in the climate. <br/>But like many of the decisions coming out of the COP26 climate summit, the final agreement has been widely slammed as weak and ineffective. <br/>Diplomats at COP26 agreed Saturday evening to do more to fight climate change and help vulnerable countries. Working a full day past the scheduled end of the conference, negotiators thrashed out an agreement to submit better plans next year to cut their emissions in 2030, finalized rules about trading emissions on carbon markets, and promised faster reductions in coal use and fossil fuel subsidies. <br/>Glasgow avoids uncomfortable questions <br/>But the final document avoided uncomfortable questions about who should pay and how much. <br/>Campaigners and analysts slammed the Glasgow Climate Pact for failing to make rich polluters pay reparations for losses and damages brought about by extreme weather events that climate change has turbocharged. <br/>Rich countries now plan to pay poorer ones $100 billion a year to green their economies and adapt to the effects of climate change by 2023, despite having promised and failed to do so by 2020. With international studies showing the costs of climate change running into the trillions, the sum of money is not enough to cover the costs of the transition and includes loans for which they will have to pay interest. <br/>\"It is hard to trust,\" said Andrea Meza, environment and energy minister of Costa Rica. \"But at the end, we need to continue pushing.\" <br/>Ending fossil fuels? <br/>The conference is the first time a UN climate summit has formally named the cause of global warming and agreed to burn less coal. <br/>But China and India, the world's biggest and third-biggest carbon polluters, respectively, as well as the globe's top two coal-burning nations, pushed at the last minute to weaken a line about accelerating the coal phase-out in a move that angered vulnerable countries on the frontlines of climate change. Rather than a phase-out of coal, India and China called for its use to be \"phased-down.\" <br/>\"We accept this change with the greatest reluctance,\" said Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, which is being steadily submerged by rising sea levels. Fighting back tears, COP26 President Alok Sharma apologized for the compromise before banging his gavel to adopt the pact. <br/>Coal was a sticking point during the summit as groups of countries pledged to phase it out, and some banks agreed to cut financing for it, while several countries have fought to keep any mention of coal out of the agreement. Despite the weakened language in the final text, campaigners hailed it as a step towards ending the use of the dirtiest source of energy. <br/>\"There's been a very clear signal out of this meeting that coal is one its way out,\" said Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan. <br/>1.5 C target in 'intensive care' <br/>For decades, scientists have rung alarm bells that burning fossil fuels releases gases that act like a greenhouse and heat the planet. At a previous UN climate summit in 2015 in Paris, world leaders agreed to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees C, and ideally 1.5 degrees C, but they have failed to pursue policies that would achieve that goal, the UN reported. Temperatures are on track to rise between 2.4 degrees C and 2.7 degrees C by the end of the century even if world leaders meet their promises for 2030. <br/>That would spell a world of increasingly intolerable heat waves, droughts, coastal floods and tropical cyclones. The difference between 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C, Maldives Environment Minister Aminath Shauna told negotiators in the plenary room shortly before the final text was adopted, is one of \"life or death.\" <br/>The UK government, which hosted the summit, had set a goal for the conference of keeping the lower temperature target alive. After the deal was struck, COP26 President Sharma said: \"I think we can say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 within reach, but its pulse is weak.\" <br/>Just how weak is open for debate. <br/>\"Even with all the new Glasgow proposals, emissions in 2030 are still almost double what they should be for 1.5 C,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, a climate scientist at NewClimate Institute, a think tank in Germany. \"Glasgow resuscitated 1.5 C, but it is still in intensive care.\" <br/>\"It's not a good outcome that could be better. It's a bad outcome that could have been worse,\" said Nathan Thanki from the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice, criticizing positive spin from non-profit organizations in rich countries that were celebrating small steps. \"It's sickening. I can't believe more people don't call it out.\" <br/>Success or failure? <br/>The two-week conference started with announcements from big countries like Nigeria and India to cut emissions to net-zero \u2014 meaning they pollute the atmosphere with as much greenhouse gas as they suck back out \u2014 by 2060 and 2070, respectively. <br/>In a flurry of announcements, some groups of countries also agreed to phase out coal, burn less methane, cut down fewer trees and get rid of cars that burn fossil fuels. The UK government statements on the impact of these pledges were panned by activistsover the course of the summit. <br/>\"This summit has been a bunch of lies and greenwashing,and it physically hurts me to think of it,\" said Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a climate activist with the Fridays for Future movement from the Philippines, in tears. \"I am so sad and angry and honestly terrified.\" <br/>Taken together, deals on methane, coal, cars and trees bring countries 9% closer to what is needed to honor their temperature targets. Including updated plans to slash emissions, the gap between what countries promised under the Paris Agreement and what's required to make those promises reality closes by 25%, according to analysis from Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a research project from NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics, another environmental non-profit. <br/>But the final document also saw breakthroughs on technical details about implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change. This includes the way countries report their emissions and trade them across borders in global carbon markets, though the rules are \"far from perfect\" and still contain loopholes, according to Tom Evans, policy advisor at climate think tank E3G. <br/>\"If exploited, they could seriously undermine efforts to reduce emissions,\" he said. <br/>The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has continued to rise despite decades of climate diplomacy. World leaders will return to the negotiating table next year in Egypt to update their plans to cut emissions. Poorer countries will push to move discussions about climate reparations into hard cash. <br/>\"The outcome of COP26 is a compromise,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. \"It is an important step, but not enough.

With all the world's major economies now committed to cutting emissions, DW looks at what we can expect in 2021.After four years of former US President Donald Trump's pushback on climate change policy, President Joe Biden has lost no time in setting a climate neutral target for the US of 2050. The new president has also announced an international climate change conference for Earth Day, April 22, solidifying his commitment to global cooperation.With Biden in the White House, 2021 \"is likely to be the biggest year ever for climate change policy,\" according to Tim Gore of the Brussels-based green think tank The Institute for European Environmental Policy.Last year already saw big steps forward. By the end of 2020, two thirds of the world's emitters had pledged to cut emissions in the long term. The landmark Paris Agreement signed by 195 countries in 2015, committing to limit global temperature increases to maximum 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, also came into effect in 2020.As part of the agreement, each country is required to submit a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) every five years   a short-term goal on how this will be achieved. </p><p>After the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP26, was postponed to November 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, countries have a little more time to submit updated NDCs   including, now they have rejoined, the United States.\"In terms of NDCs, every country now needs short-term ambitions that are in line with long-term goals,\" climate scientist and founding partner of the German NewClimate Institute Niklas H\u00f6hne told DW.Rachel Cleetus, policy director of the climate and energy program at the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, agreed that short-term commitments are key.\"By the time we get to COP26, we need major emitters like the US and the EU to have stepped up with new ambitious targets,\" Cleetus said. \"The Biden administration should join hands with the EU to form a highly ambitious coalition of the willing.\"All eyes on Biden's next moveAll parties are curious what goals Biden will set for the next decade to make his long-term targets achievable. His administration has already indicated an aim to make the US power sector climate neutral by 2035. The EU, which submitted an updated NDC in December 2020, aims to cut all emissions by at least 55% by 2030.Cleetus and Gore both singled out transport policy as one vital area for both the US and the EU in achieving their long-term targets.\"Transport is the biggest growing source of emissions in the US and the EU,\" Gore pointed out. \"We can expect some big announcements this year on how both Biden and the EU legislate on CO2 emissions from vehicles.\"\"And we also need governments to encourage and incentivize the private sector to step up,\" Cleetus pointed out. \"Auto manufacturer General Motors has already made an ambitious announcement to make [most of] its vehicles electric by 2035.\"Another key Biden pledge, which has been reflected to various degrees by other major emitters around the world, is the focus on rebuilding communities currently based around fossil fuel economies. Biden has announced a federal work group for economic revitalization of coal and power communities in the US, Cleetus explained.\"We have to make sure we are investing in a fair transition for these communities   and this is just as much of an issue in countries like Germany or China,\" Cleetus added.International contributions must be 'fair'While the US and the EU are single-handedly responsible for a great deal of the world's emissions, domestic green policies alone will not go far enough in tackling the global crisis.In line with the fair share policy outlined in the Paris Agreement, major emitters like the US and the EU must focus more on their international contributions to countries in the Global South, Harjeet Singh, climate change lead for anti-poverty NGO Action Aid, told DW.\"The current US target is actually around one fifth of its fair share,\" Singh said. \"If one country has historically occupied more ecological space, then that country has to do more to help developing countries.\"Singh cited the example of India which, with an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic and Cyclone Amphan in 2020, needs climate finance to achieve green infrastructure goals.\"There are two things that need to be in the NDC: A domestic and an international contribution,\" climate scientist H\u00f6hne explained. \"I don't think it is yet fully understood by some developed countries that the NDC can only be fair if it involves international contributions.\"Cleetus believes that Biden's government is aware of this responsibility and the importance of \"climate justice.\"\"Biden's special envoy on climate change, John Kerry, has talked about the moral imperative of the climate crisis. This shows the Biden administration is willing to pay its fair share,\" she said.What will China do?Aside from the complex issue of climate finance, major emitters can also work on a global scale by setting good examples.\"Lots of countries are holding their cards close to their chest at the moment, waiting to see what the US does with its NDC   none more than China,\" Gore said.China surprised the world in late 2020 by announcing a target to be carbon neutral by 2060. Japan and South Korea quickly followed with their own long-term emissions-cutting pledges.\"The big question in the Chinese context is when they will peak their emissions,\" Gore added. \"It makes all the difference if that happens closer to 2025 or closer to 2030.\"Singh also sees Biden's role as highly influential. \"Biden's administration will push other countries into taking action. They can no longer hide behind the US,\" he said.H\u00f6hne gave the example of Brazil, which under President Jair Bolsonaro has \"gone backwards\" by putting forward an NDC that is less ambitious than its previous target. Bolsonaro, like former US President Trump, has denied the existence of climate change. But with Trump out of the White House, H\u00f6hne suggested that even climate-denying leaders like Bolsonaro may be forced to step up and take action.\"When the US and China put forward their NDCs, all other countries will have to put something ambitious forward too,\" he said.The power of the peopleLeaders like Bolsonaro may also face pressure from home. \"It is no longer possible for a democratic government to go to its voters and say they won't do anything on climate change,\" H\u00f6hne said.A January 2021 survey by the UN Development Agency   the People's Climate Vote   showed that 64% of people around the world believe that climate change is a global emergency, a number that is even higher for those under 18.\"The time for climate denialism is long gone,\" Harjeet Singh said. \"Countries can no longer make excuses.\" </p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["The current US target is actually around one fifth of its fair share,\" Singh said. \"If one country has historically occupied more ecological space, then that country has to do more to help developing countries.

But can Fridays for Future survive this change? DW spoke with activists across the globe.When Fridays for Future (FFF) takes to the streets on March 19, activists around the world are going to be doing everything they can to make sure the climate crisis stays in the news.In the Netherlands, 16-year-old Erik Christiansson will join a small physically distanced protest in The Hague with other Dutch FFF members.Meanwhile, some 12,000 kilometers to the south in Zambia, a 26-year-old man named Chilekwa Kangwa will give a radio interview highlighting the importance of education and sustainable agriculture.Across the Atlantic and eight time zones away, Adriana Calderon, an 18-year-old Mexican, will be deploying a sticker campaign in support of renewable energy and targeting the massive global K-pop fan base on social media, in the hope that the FFF message goes viral.\"The big marches with tens of thousands of people which we had in 2019 are just not possible anymore,\" said Christiansson, 16, speaking with DW from his home near Utrecht.Over the past year, he and other young activists around the globe have tried to adapt and come up with new virtual approaches to get the message out \u2014 a #DigitalStrike from online class, for example, or social media posts with eye-catching slogans.Overall, though, it's been a struggle. </p><p>\"We noticed that it's been a lot less effective,\" said Christiansson, who has been involved with climate advocacy for about two years. \"On social media, often your posts get seen by other people who already agree with you and you don't really get that much attention from outside.\"Calderon has also found it difficult to share her climate concerns under Mexico's emergency coronavirus measures. Speaking with passersby at an in-person march, she said, you may have several minutes to get your message across. Online, that attention span shrinks to just seconds.\"With social media, it's very hard \u2014 you have to be really precise in your words,\" she said. Her local FFF group, based in Cuernavaca, Morelos, found it too difficult to carry on under the quarantine measures and shut down its social media presence in November.Has the pandemic weakened Friday's for Future?Still, Friday's for Future has managed to continue. But can it regain the momentum it once had?\"Visible public events are undeniably the foundation for a social movement \u2014 to mobilize people, to mobilize support and to gain public attention. And this is definitely missing,\" said Jens Marquardt, a postdoctoral researcher in climate change politics and societal transformation at Stockholm University.While it was inevitable that some media coverage would drop off in 2020 once the movement's novelty had worn off, he believes the pandemic has hit FFF particularly hard and made it difficult for the movement to get its message out. But that hasn't necessarily been detrimental, said Darrick Evensen, a professor of environmental politics at the University of Edinburgh.\"It's a very different world because of the coronavirus pandemic and the manifestation of climate activism has certainly evolved \u2014 necessarily so because of the lack of opportunities for in-person interaction,\" he said.Christiansson agrees. Stuck at home in the Netherlands under lockdown, Christiansson helped produce some webinars for the FFF YouTube channel and began chatting with other activists his age abroad.\"We've talked a lot more internationally than we did before, when everyone was focused on their own strikes and their national politics,\" he said. \"Since we were communicating with everyone online already, it was easy to get connections with people in other countries as well.\"Evensen points out that it's not just the medium of the message that's changing, either \u2014 the message itself has evolved over the last year. Global strikes like the one set for this Friday aren't just stressing the climate emergency; talking points now include worker welfare, climate justice and the role of civil society in climate decision-making.\"The rhetoric is changing,\" said Evensen. \"It does seem that this really heavy focus on science is waning, and it's become more of a blended image in terms of the interests that are that are being represented.\"This shift in focus could be linked to the secondary effects of the pandemic and a heightened perception of risk, both in terms of our health and the health of the planet, he said, adding, \"People are maybe spending more time outside, people are thinking more about their interaction with the natural world.\"Evensen was part of a recent UK study showing that climate concerns haven't diminished during the pandemic, as they did during the last global financial crisis in 2008 \u2014 and he said he was seeing similar data in other parts of the world. In some cases, respondents even identified climate change as a bigger threat than the virus.\"It is actually quite astonishing to see that this [FFF] movement has been so resilient and robust, despite this massive crisis,\" said Marquardt. \"This year of reflection has been helpful in shaping the agenda about what this movement is about and what this movement wants to achieve in the future.\"More space for marginalized voicesMarquardt said the pandemic has also given FFF the chance to bring in marginalized voices. At the last global strike on September 25 the movement emphasized the \"most affected people and areas,\" or MAPA, a new term for the areas of the world that will be disproportionately harmed by climate change, in an attempt to bring them into the global debate.\"Of course, you still have some imbalance, in terms of basic internet access, ways of communicating, who speaks for whom. [But] the pandemic has very much increased cooperation and also exchange between different national and local activist groups,\" he said.Adriana Calderon, who joined FFF in Mexico about a year ago just as the world was shutting down, has thrown herself into virtual campaigns on social media and YouTube, coordinating global support for MAPA. Before the pandemic, she said, people in the Global South lacked this dedicated community to express themselves among people who understood their concerns.\"Today, there are more than a hundred activists, and we are like a community. We have calls on Saturdays, we have our own social media. We plan together what we want to do, and we ally with other groups to make campaigns,\" she said. \"There was a community before, but now I think the international community is doing more because we were forced to move to digital, forced to interact with other groups. And I can see how much the movement has grown since last year.\"'We can't stop here'Taking part of that growth has been Chilekwa Kangwa, a 26-year-old from Mpika in northeastern Zambia. Kangwa, who founded the Action for Nature conservation and development group in 2017, only got involved with FFF recently. But he has already linked up with several campaigners in other countries to swap stories about sustainable agriculture and other issues relevant for his region.\"Climate change affects people in different ways,\" he said, adding that this global exchange through MAPA can help his community, and others, find the tools needed to fight climate change and transform livelihoods. \"What should be done now is that we must begin to listen to one another.\"On Friday, Zambia's less restrictive coronavirus measures will allow Kangwa to take part in a march in Mpika with many excited young students, the first such FFF event in his community. That's an experience that Calderon hopes will soon be possible in her part of the world, too.\"People miss physically going on strike,\" she said. But she thinks that when the world begins to emerge from the COVID restrictions, the digital advances of the last year won't be forgotten. \"At the end of the day, we will still be using both. We have developed so much, and we can't stop here.\" </p><p/>", "publisher": "Deutsche Welle World", "instances": ["Christiansson agrees.

It is based on the worldview of indigenous peoples and, simply put, aims to ensure material, social and spiritual satisfaction for all members of a community, but not at the expense of others or to the detriment of the natural environment. In 2008, the government of Rafael Correa, who then served as Ecuador's left-wing president, enshrined Buen Vivir in the new constitution as a policy principle. In the meantime, however, the concept has lost significance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Ecuador's national development plans (from 2009 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2017), indigenous peoples hardly figured. Mentioning them only served a symbolic purpose and legitimised government policy. Constant reference was made to Buen Vivir's indigenous origins, but its specific indigenous content was never spelled out. Variations of Buen Vivir thinking, however, are found in the documents of indigenous movements beginning in the 1930s. Since the 1990s, indigenous activists have also connected Buen Vivir with calls for local self-administration within a plurinational state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Partially as a result of the contradictions, the Buen Vivir ideology split into three main branches after the adoption of the 2008 constitution:</p><p>1. the indigenous branch is concerned with autonomy and self-determination,</p><p>2. the state branch is geared to inclusive development and human rights, and</p><p>3. a third branch views growth and development with scepticism and is centred around economist Alberto Acosta and others who oppose oil extraction.</p><p>The three branches have developed in different ways, but there was constant interaction between them.</p><p>The indigenous branch of Buen Vivir has the clearest definition and the longest history. It has been described by the recently deceased activist Benjam\u00edn Inuca. Since the 1930s, variations of the concept have been used to politicise indigenous identity. Since the 1980s, indigenous peoples in Ecuador have been demanding territorial autonomy, plurinationality and interculturality. In this sense, the indigenous version of Buen Vivir is about self-determination at the local level, with development respecting cultural differences and resulting from the action of civil society and local organisations rather than an overarching state. Accordingly, the indigenous branch of Buen Vivir generally opposes the exploitation of natural resources.</p><p>In the wake of the anti-government protests of October 2019, in which 20,000 members of indigenous peoples were involved, the term has fallen into disuse. Other terms are now preferred instead, like plurinationality or Kawsay Sacha (meaning roughly living forest). The latter is also disseminated internationally by Patricia</p><p>Gualinga, an activist from Sarayaku Kichwa.</p><p>A new dawn</p><p>The state branch of Buen Vivir has a distinct origin. It arose with the sense of a new political dawn when the Correa government took office in 2007 and established the constituent assembly. The governing party, Alianza PAIS, saw itself as a collective left-wing movement. The new constitution and the initial government policies reflected a broad variety of positions, including the current that criticises conventional development and is associated with Acosta. He is the most prominent intellectual proponent of Buen Vivir worldwide.</p><p>At the core of this governmental vision is an inclusive development that:</p><p> dismantles inequalities,</p><p> relies on sustainable oil production and mining and</p><p> is driven by state agencies.</p><p>This branch of Buen Vivir thinking considers the state to be unified and centralised. It does not offer scope for more local independence and self-administration. In 2009 and 2010, Ren\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez, then the head of the state planning authority, made an unsuccessful attempt to define a version of socialism based on Buen Vivir. Under his successors, the idea lost its centrality.</p><p>President Lenin Moreno, Correa's successor, took office in 2017. He has drastically reduced the Buen Vivir rhetoric. The current development plan (2017-2021) no longer includes the term in its title. The Secretariat of Buen Vivir, which was only ever symbolic, has been closed. 'Living well' is no longer government policy.</p><p>Indeed, the state version of Buen Vivir had been in crisis since at least 2013. That was the year when Correa's third term began. It was characterised by economic difficulties and an increasingly authoritarian style of governance. In 2013, Correa officially ended the innovative initiative Yasun\u00ed-ITT due to a lack of international support. Yasun\u00ed-ITT was an attempt to prevent oil extraction in a large biosphere reserve in the Amazon region. The idea was that industrialised nations would compensate Ecuador for foregone export revenues. The initiative was designed with input from Acosta. The plan was discussed in Germany's Bundestag, but Dirk Niebel, who was then the federal minister for economic cooperation and development, did not support it. The failure of this flagship project meant that, at the international level, an important pillar of Buen Vivir had collapsed.</p><p>Acosta and his supporters had actually broken with the Correa government as early as 2008, so the group's influence on his government waned and the state version of Buen Vivir started to lose relevance. However, Acosta continued to promote the concept independently and became very active at the international level. From 2009 on, he disseminated his version of Buen Vivir in English- and German-language publications. He attended many conferences and gave numerous speeches.</p><p>In his eyes, Buen Vivir is an open and ongoing project. It is inspired by indigenous cultures and fosters a harmonious relationship with nature. The term can be rather freely interpreted. However, Acosta rejects industrial development, oil extraction and mining. His version of Buen Vivir fits the Yasun\u00ed-ITT initiative well, as it is closely related to ideas of climate justice, post-growth and development criticism. Some of his demands resonate internationally. In 2015, for example, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, then the French president, referred to Buen Vivir in a speech. Acosta's ideas have left marks on international debate - for example at climate summits and in other UN contexts. They have had an impact on various institutions, including the UNESCO-funded programme Global Citizenship Education.</p><p>The high point for the Acosta branch of Buen Vivir was the Degrowth Conference in 2014 in Leipzig, Germany. Buen Vivir was prominently discussed at that conference, which convened scientists as well as social activists. The focus was on criticism of both growth and development. Later attempts to spread Buen Vivir thinking were less effective. They included a 2015 tour of the USA by Franco Viteri, a member of the Sarayaku people, and lectures Acosta and Grupo Sal continue to hold in Germany.</p><p>Not entirely distinct notions</p><p>The three versions of Buen Vivir have distinct orientations and foundations, but they are not entirely separate. There are several synergies. Proponents of all three branches endorsed the Yasun\u00ed-ITT initiative. There is also an underlying sense of mutual acceptance, especially between the indigenous movement's version and the version that criticises development. Tensions primarily arose about what role the state should play. The indigenous movements reject European ideas of statehood, whereas development critics tend to pin their hopes on spontaneous local cooperation. The Correa administration considered Buen Vivir to be tangible policy.</p><p>For some time, Buen Vivir was an innovative concept that served to link different discourses to one another. During its peak from 2009 to 2013, it provided a platform for a variety of interesting initiatives. As a state policy, however, it ultimately gave way to more traditional approaches. Its appeal to scientists and social movements is in decline. Though Buen Vivir has lost much of its relevance, the disputes it facilitated were meaningful and would not have occurred without it.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["He attended many conferences and gave numerous speeches.

Particularly in large metropolises, the huge number of cars has become a massive problem, with negative impacts on people's quality of life, the environment and economic development. Measures to strengthen non-motorised transport are urgently needed - not least because they would serve a social justice perspective.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a means of getting from one place to another, walking or cycling have a number of advantages: they are eco-friendly and inexpensive, have health benefits and require very little space. They do not lead to the negative consequences of motorised transport such as air pollution, noise exposure and greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming.</p><p>Nonetheless, car traffic is prioritised in many places. The car is a status symbol that stands for prosperity and progress. It also has great economic relevance. Without motorised transport, trade in its present form would be impossible, remote areas would be nearly inaccessible and nation-wide distribution networks would seem utopian. On the other hand, systemic limits have been reached in many congested \u00adareas and metropolises. In those places, more non-motorised transport can significantly contribute to solving problems. A good example is Bangkok, which is famous for its permanent traffic jams (see box).</p><p>Many fatalities</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists are killed disproportionately often in traffic accidents (see article by Katja Dombrowski in D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2020/01, Focus section). That is true worldwide, but the risk to non-motorised road users is highest in Africa's big cities. For example, pedestrians made up 65?% of all traffic fatalities in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi in 2016, according to \u00adofficial data. Like other metropolises around the world, Nairobi's urban planning has badly neglected cyclists, pedestrians and other non-motorised road users for decades. It focused instead on expanding infrastructure for motor vehicles, particularly cars.</p><p>In 2015, however, Nairobi began to change course. In cooperation with the Share the Road Programme of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), which aims to improve the situation of pedestrians and cyclists in the global South, the city drafted a policy specifically for non-motorised transport. Nairobi's governor at the time, Evans Kidero, gave several reasons, including the following: 'There is clear evidence that non-motorised transport provides efficient mobility with substantially low investment.'</p><p>First and foremost, such a policy must improve conditions for strongly disadvantaged road users, namely pedestrians and cyclists. Relevant measures include building sidewalks and bike trails as well as calming down traffic, for instance, by introducing 20 mile per hour zones or curves in the road. Such measures should be supplemented by awareness-raising campaigns. In order to show that they are serious, Nairobi's municipal leaders determined that 20?% of the road-construction budget must be used for infrastructure for non-motorised and public transport.</p><p>Carly Koinange, the director of the Share the Road Programme, thinks Nairobi is setting a good example not only for Africa. The earmarking of funds is something the global North could adopt too, she told Zeit online, the web version of a prominent German newspaper. Her intention is not to create a rivalry between developing and industrialised countries, but rather to promote equity among all the different road users.</p><p>Only time will tell how successful and sustainable Nairobi's new traffic policy is. Between 2013 and 2019, the number of the city's registered motorised vehicles climbed from just under 2 million to about 3 million. Traffic jams and chaos are part of everyday life - and they go along with serious economic costs: according to World Bank estimates, Nairobi loses half a million dollars a day due to traffic jams.</p><p>Transport planners in Nairobi are promoting non-motorised transport to improve living for all residents in terms of better air quality and less noise. Furthermore, according to Kidero, private households will be able to save money because non-motorised transport tends to be cheaper. The construction of sidewalks and bike paths will improve access. And since the majority of lower-income people depend on non-motorised transport, their income situation will improve and they may even find opportunities to earn additional income.</p><p>Better infrastructure for non-motorised traffic does not only serve environmental goals, but social justice as well.

On the University of the Philippines campus in Manila, students, environmentalists and indigenous people gathered to address the climate crisis. They held placards with slogans including 'What do we want? #ClimateJustice! When do we want it? NOW!'   Students from Saint Louis University in the mountain resort city of Baguio joined a protest denouncing nations and corporations that fail to address 'heatwaves, violent storms, warmer oceans, vanishing coastal towns, the extinction of species and raging forest fires.'  A series of protests is set to take place across the country from September 20 to 27, organized by groups including the Youth for Strike Climate Philippines and Zero Waste Pilipinas.  'A key demand that unites all of these strikes is a call for the Philippine government to declare a climate emergency,' Youth Strike for Climate Philippines said.

However, does it consider farmers\u2019 rights and development to achieve a farmer-centered approach?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indonesia is the world\u2019s fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and a large proportion of these emissions come from the conversion of forests and carbon-rich peatlands into productive agricultural land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of this conversion is driven by the nation\u2019s crop estates (e.g. oil palms, cocoa and coffee). Although smallholder farmers own only small plots of land (on average less than 1 hectare in Java and more than 5 outside Java), they farm at least 40 percent of Indonesia\u2019s total land area planted with oil palms. Meanwhile, under the Nucleus Estates and Smallholders (NES) scheme, a company acquires 70 percent of the land under development. However, as land scarcity drives up the value of unconverted plots, farmers are keen to hold onto a greater share.</p><p>For many smallholder farmers, modern, chemical-based fertilizers are unaffordable. Traditional slash and burn practices have led to an increase in the soil\u2019s mineral content. As fires become more frequent, however, soils begin to degrade and farmers are left with an area of land with limited fertility.</p><p>Farmers\u2019 shifting cultivation practices also cause damage to local river systems through increased sediment discharge and the release of chemical fertilizers, harming fish and other aquatic life. Some environmental groups have claimed that palm oil companies committed to ending deforestation and sustainable production, are, in fact, encouraging slash and burn by smallholder farmers so as to enlarge plantation size.</p><p>Deforestation is often the only option available for the livelihoods of smallholder farmers living in Indonesia\u2019s forested areas. Compounding this, the Indonesian government has made attempts to roll back no-deforestation pledges to allow smallholder farmers to continue using unsustainable agricultural practices.</p><p>On top of this, climate change impacts are now emerging as a serious threat to progress in Indonesia\u2019s agricultural development. With a strong dependence on climate-sensitive natural resources to support their livelihoods, smallholder farmers in Indonesia are highly vulnerable to climate change. To cope with these challenges, approaches to this issue in Indonesia are becoming even more complex, combining the more established practices of environmental protection and poverty reduction with emerging concepts related to global climate change: mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>State-owned forestry company Perhutani has practiced the prosperity approach concept for forest communities since the 1970s. This has been done by training nearby farmers to cultivate honey and use inter-cropping in teakwood forests in Java. As the farmers benefit directly from the teakwood forests, Perhutani joins the efforts to protect teakwood plantations.</p><p>However, Ansori et al. ( 2011 ) found that the level of community participation in program planning and evaluation was low. The pattern of partnership was asymmetric because the decision making was dominated by Perhutani personnel. In the cooperative agreements, there were many unequal positions. The program is considered a derivative of a developmental ideology contrary to the principles of community empowerment. The partnership is focused more on corporate interests and is used to reduce conflict.</p><p>These things seem to have been anticipated later, in 2002, by biologist Willie Smits with better profit-sharing planning with the farmers. Smits and his colleagues started to apply another approach to rebuilding rainforests in Kalimantan. The program has been empowering smallholder farmers to find alternatives to harvesting forests. It was started with a team of 100 local farmers to restore 5,000 hectares of devastated forest. To grow, protect and preserve the forest land itself, the program offers local farmers free land to plant crops in the forest.</p><p>In return for both the land and farming income, the farmers must protect the rainforest. The program has been advancing farmer cooperatives, organic farming techniques and a fair trade system. By improving around 3,000 farmers\u2019 quality of life and building trust throughout the community, the program has provided powerful incentives for both long-term ecological and economic restoration.</p><p>The program has planted over 1,000 trees of varying species to build up a new forest. Along the edges of the land parcels, the farmers plant rows of sugar palms, which are fire- and floodresistant and produce sugar water every day that can be tapped and used as a biofuel. The government has pledged to make this palm sugar concept a national project and to be replicated in eight provinces in Indonesia.</p><p>By providing alternatives and proper incentives for the local farmers, the program has achieved both political legitimacy and economic growth for resilient farmers, and established a model for restoring forests to achieve mitigation targets.</p><p>Investing in climate action by smallholders is showing incredible impact in terms of food security, biodiversity improvement and carbon mitigation. However, doubt still remains about sharing the burdens and benefits of the program equitably and fairly with landless farmers, since the rebuilding program focuses more on forest biodiversity, not on a farmer-centered approach to development.

We are talking about the infrastructure belonging to a revered public institution. There have been thousands of students who have graduated from this institution, paying the least amount of tuition fees. Some of the graduates are currently working in reputed organisations; few of them might have been renowned geographers or politicians--graduates of Trichandra have become ministers even--but the dilapidated building remains helpless in the heart of Kathmandu. It may not be wise to judge the quality of education provided at Trichandra by the exterior facade of its buildings, but the appearance of the infrastructure signifies some things are not going well within the institution. We can consider that the government-owned education institutions lack a large budget. But they have plentiful human resources if the administration wishes to mobilise them for a good cause.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are numerous serious problems prevalent in public education which have been deteriorating the quality of education for a long time. The politicisation of management, professors and student governance are a significant cause for this. And such an issue has been deteriorating the quality of private schools and colleges as well.</p><p>Management is accountable, for better or worse, for the performance of any institution. In recent times, we have seen the positive transformation that slight change in management can have on institutions, as observed in a few of the community schools. There is no reason to believe that such changes would not occur in how the campuses and universities are run as well. The sad fact is that student unions have been influencing the management of public institutions. To fulfil the demand of particular interest groups, they padlock administration offices--and the administration is also used to such incidents happening with regularity.</p><p>In most cases, both management and student bodies are found to be besieged by the interest groups of different political parties. There is a general understanding that the educational institutions have been weakening due to politically motivated unionisation. The professors are also party to this trend.</p><p>It is undeniable that the political transformation that we have witnessed since the Rana regime owes a lot to the valuable contribution of the student-cum-political leader. Politically motivated students helped establish democracy in Nepal. In the early stages of political transformation, the students were the only medium to create awareness among the people and to sow the seeds of democracy across the country. To accomplish their goals, the leading student figures of that time --the late BP Koirala and GM Singh among others--introduced the concept of the student union with the Nepal Chatra Sangh in India. Later, that leadership came into power with the majority vote in the first democratically held elections, but failed to restore democracy due to a coup by King Mahendra. As a result, Nepal underwent another political turmoil--the Panchayat system. It was during this time that student unions were formally introduced in the campuses as students' representative welfare organisations meant to fight for the students' rights. The functioning, however, was deviated towards the movement for the restoration of democracy. With the help of student unions, political parties were able to establish a multiparty democracy by overthrowing the Panchayat system.</p><p>Through these political developments, the unions contributed very little to student welfare. Following the development of higher education institutions across Nepal, the student unions started mushrooming as the wings of different political parties. Unfortunately, instead of utilising the knowledge and skills of the youths to transform the nation, they have been mobilised by the major political parties in destructive activities, ranging from vandalising public property to abduction and extortion for material gains.</p><p>It is indeed surprising not to hear of any student union fighting against the deteriorating quality of education, the subsequent corruption cases within the university, haphazard affiliation decisions and the campuses becoming a breeding ground for the educated unemployed. It is distressing to note that the student unions didn't issue a public notice against corruption during the recent turmoil at Tribhuvan University. At present, the student unions are solely focused on power accumulation and making a ladder to reach in mainstream politics ignoring the future of thousands of other students. Subsequently, a majority of the people now believe that either student unions need to realign their priorities or that there should be alternate Student Welfare Clubs (SWC) and Alma Mater Societies (AMS).</p><p>In terms of civic participation, those students who are not involved in any political union are doing a better job compared to those that are members. We have been witnessing hundreds of students peacefully protesting for the right to clean air, youth rights, climate justice and for several social causes. Last time, school and college students together showed solidarity to Greta Thunberg's #Fridayforfuture, a climate justice movement at Maitighar mandala.

The company said it has co-founded the Climate Pledge, a plan to make companies carbon neutral by 2040 and reach the goal of the Paris Accord ten years ahead of schedule.  Amazon is the first signatory to the Climate Pledge and urged other large companies too to sign the agreement.  Companies that sign the Climate Pledge must report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis, implement de-carbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement, and neutralize any remaining emissions to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.

It is not designed to capture the low-hanging fruit; instead, it is deliberately designed to allow the world to pay for transformative change, which would have higher costs, but would allow countries to leapfrog to new emissions reduction technologies.</p><p>The CSE considers that this goal can only be met by setting a floor cost to qualify projects for accreditation under the Paris market mechanism. The floor cost should be carefully set to eliminate projects which would not provide the transformative change that is required in today\u2019s climate risked world.</p><p>This restriction should ideally be in the form of a minimum cost per tonne ideally at least USD100 per tonne of carbon dioxide mitigated. Only activities or technologies with a cost above this threshold should be allowed accreditation under Article 6.</p><p>This restriction must be a foundational pillar of market design from the beginning, not an add-on at a later stage.
